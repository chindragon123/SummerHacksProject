TA: TBA
E-mail: TBA
Office hours: TBA or by appointment
2. Course materials:

Textbook: Ohanian and Markert, Physics for Engineers and Scientists, Volume I, 3rd Ed. This course
covers chapters 1 through 18. The syllabus represents the nominal amount. Additional
concepts, if needed in HW problems, will be included.

Canvas: http://canvas.utexas.edu/ contains this Syllabus, provides access to Lectures, Office hours,
Announcements.

Quest: http://quest.cns.utexas.edu provides access to Homework, Tests, Final, Grades,
Announcements.

This course makes use of the web-based Quest content delivery and homework server
system maintained by the College of Natural Sciences. This homework service will
require a $30 charge per student for its use, which goes toward the maintenance and
operation of the resource. Please go to http://quest.cns.utexas.edu to log in to the
Quest system for this class. After the 12th day of class, when you log into Quest you
will be asked to pay via credit card on a secure payment site. You have the option to
wait up to 30 days to pay while still continuing to use Quest for your assignments. If
you are taking more than one course using Quest, you will not be charged more than
$60/semester. Quest provides mandatory instructional material for this course, just
as is your textbook, etc. For payment questions, email quest. billing@cns.utexas.edu.

Zoom: hittp://zoom.its.utexas.edu/ will be used to access Lectures, Lecture recordings, Office Hours
(via Canvas/Zoom). You will not be able to access a Zoom meeting until your upgrade to
Zoom 5.0 (https://zoom.its.utexas.edu/zoom-upgrade).

3. Prerequisite: Credit with a grade of at least C- or registration in Mathematics 408D, 408L, or 4088S, and
Physics 103M; and an appropriate score on the physics assessment exam.

4. Quantitative Reasoning: This course may be counted toward the quantitative reasoning flag requirement.
Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the
types of quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-
world problems.

5. Drop deadlines: 6/5 - Last day of the official add/drop period; 6/9 - Last day to drop a class for a possible
refund; 7/9 - Last day to drop a first-term class, with required approvals.

6. Students with disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
adjustments for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Services for Students with
Disabilities at 512-471-6259, 512-410-6644 (VP) (http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/).

7. Interactive quiz oriented teaching: We intersperse lectures with interactive quiz (poll) sessions. Questions
for these "IQ"-questions are chosen to highlight the course materials and give students guidance in doing HW
problems. Good understanding of textbook examples, IQ questions, and homework problems will help you to
understand the physics of this course.

8. Study suggestions: Students are responsible for assigned sections of the book even if they are not covered
in class. Read the material to be covered in class before coming to class, and a second time afterward. Start
working on your homework problems as soon as they are available and turn your work in as soon as you have
completed it (you get multiple tries for missed questions). Get help if you have trouble understanding thematerial ! The importance of doing the homework assignments (and understanding them) can not be
overemphasized. Very few students pass who do not do well in their homework. Please don't fall behind. Also,
you should work the problems at the end of the chapter, looking for particularly interesting ones to solve in
addition to those which you have done for homework.

9. Lectures: Synchronous mode: Lectures will take place (live) MTWTHF at 10am; all times here and below
in Central Daylight Time (CDT) (UTC-5). The lectures can be accessed via Canvas (Canvas calendar will have
links to all the lectures). Asynchronous mode: the lectures will be recorded and the recordings will become
available on Canvas shortly after every lecture. Class recordings are reserved only for the use of members
of this class (students, TAs, and the instructor) and only for educational purposes. Recordings should
not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction could lead to Student
Misconduct proceedings.

10. Attendance: Class attendance for live lectures is not mandatory but is strongly recommended. Class
interruptions such as chatting or video interference are unacceptable. Your cooperation in maintaining a good
atmosphere for learning is required.

11. Formula sheet: The Formula sheet gives the basic formulas/principles which you will be learning in this
course. We encourage you to use it as your study companion. It is meant to help you to organize the course
materials, to do homework and to review for exams. Queries on the summary are welcome anytime. You can
find this summary on Canvas/Files.

12. Homework/Tests/Final: (all online on Quest; see schedule below)

e Homework: The Quest homewrk service handles distribution and collection of the homework (HW)
on the Web. Submit your HW to Quest expeditiously. No late homework will be accepted. Continue
submitting answers until due time. Urgent messages related to HWs will be posted on Quest and
Canvas. Solutions will be available on Quest after the due time.

e Tests: There will be 4 online Tests (also referred to as Midterm Exams). See below for time and
place of each Test/Exam.

e Final exam: The final exam is comprehensive and mandatory. Friday, July 10, 7:00 pm—10:00 pm.

During each Test/Exam:

e During the exam you can use only SCRATCH PAPER, FORMULA SHEET, PEN/PENCIL,
CALCULATOR.

e FORMULA SHEET: you can print it out in advance (available on Canvas/Files) or open the
pdf file in a separate window.

e Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated (see link to University Honor Code).

13. Grading policy:
e Homework (drop 2) 30%
e Tests (drop 1) 45%
e Final 25%
> Agrade report for each assignment/exam will be available on Quest after the due time. Final course
Yoscores can be calculated as %score = 0.25*Final + 0.45*Test_average + 0.3*Homework_average.
Final letter grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric: A = 94-100; A- = 90-93; B+ =
87-89; B = 84-86; B- = 80-83; C+ = 77-79; C = 74-76; C- = 70-73; D+ = 67-69; D = 64-66; D- = 60-63; F =
0-60. Please note: to ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at
any stage, thus a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not
recognize the grade of A+. A curve may be used after the final exam, if needed, to bump the grades up
(but not down).

No make up tests will be given. Student is required to take all four Tests. At the end of the semester, the
Test with lowest score will be dropped. If a student misses a Test, the missing Test will be the one which will
be dropped. If missing a test is due to a legitimate reason approved by the instructor, the student may
alternatively choose a no-drop option, where the student's final exam score appropriately scaled may replace
the score of the missing Test. After a missing test, the student needs to immediately communicate with the
instructor through email. The student must save the email record and claim the no-drop option at the end of
the semester. For the no-drop option to be applicable, the student must take the other three Tests.First class reminders:
