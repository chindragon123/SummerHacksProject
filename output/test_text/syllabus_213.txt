Course description

This 6-week summer option examines the life course of Mexico’s Revolution through both its
armed and post-revolutionary phases, from about 1910-1940. During the semester we will focus
on several key questions. What kind of revolution (agrarian, political, social, cultural) was the
Mexican Revolution? What caused and drove it? What did ordinary people think about the
revolution and how far did they shape its course or simply suffer in its wake? Did “many
Mexicos” just produce many revolutions, or can broader narratives be discerned? What were the
main contours of Mexico’s post-revolutionary regime, and how different were they compared to
those of the old regime?

Thematically, the course will cover central topics such as the Porfiriato (1876-1911);

the maderista revolution of 1910-1913; the rise and fall of popular movements

(zapatismo, villismo) from 1910-1920; the Constitutionalist successes of 1916-1917; and the
political and cultural construction of post-revolutionary Mexico by Sonoran (1920-1934) and
later cardenista (1934-1940) state-builders, agrarians, schoolteachers, and anticlericals. The
course will consist of some brief lectures; group discussions of set readings, primary documents,
and folk songs (corridos); and occasional viewings of documentary or theater films made during
(or about) the revolutionary years.

To do well in the course, you will need to develop your analytical skills (e.g. concerning
different interpretations of the Revolution, not just matters of fact); your compositional skills (by
presenting a reasoned, opinionated case on paper); and your communication skills (by
contributing to discussions). Since this is a short term, asessment will be in the form of weekly
papers, a map quiz, and a longer, final paper.

By the end of the course you will have acquired a broad theoretical sense of what constitutes a
social revolution and a detailed knowledge of Mexico’s revolutionary history that will help you
to make up your own mind about the $64K questions: did twentieth-century Mexico truly
experience a revolution? If so, how “revolutionary” was it?1. Course materials: set texts

Everyone should acquire/access and read the following texts, which are essential for
assignments and for class discussion. These texts have been chosen to provide you with a
mixture of classic and some of the best recent scholarship on the revolution by Mexican, North
American, and European historians. I have also tried to suggest books that offer clear contrasts,
to help you to situate your own thinking about the Revolution. These books will challenge each
other’s claims concerning the character of Mexico’s revolucion and help you to form your own
opinion about the events of 1910-1940. Starred texts (*) available online as ebooks via UT
Library.
