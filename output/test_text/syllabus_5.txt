Course Summary: This Financial Statement Analysis course focuses on using an array of financial
information to best determine the wy behind past and current performance. To achieve this we combine
quantitative and qualitative factors to understand drivers of performance and to tell the story of the firm.
With a solid understanding of the past and current conditions, we move towards motivating sound
forecasts and briefly discuss well-supported inputs to valuation models.

This course is advised for individuals who possess all of the following:
|) an interest in learning and a willingness to develop new skills and perspectives;
2) an interest in how businesses operate, make decisions, change and report their performance;
3) a willingness to benefit from and contribute to the UT/McCombs’ educational experience;
4) a general, but strong, understanding of financial accounting at an introductory level as the logical

language of business. This course builds off introductory Accounting classes.

What you should expect:

Historically this has been a challenging class that requires a commitment. It 1s not challenging as you
must memorize complex formulas that you could easily look up, but as it will challenge perspectives and
require critical thinking and the synthesis of information. This is also a class that actively shuns
memorization of terms and formulas and the regurgitation of anything. We will not waste your time (and
your educational investment) with memorizing items such as ratios or formulas or emphasizing jargon
and catchphrases over thoughtful analysis. Instead we will focus on more useful ways of approaching
various issues. Therefore, you may hear many “Yes, but...” questions: “Yes, but in your own words.”
“Yes, but why? “Yes, that is the general economic argument, but how has it played out in this scenario?”
“Yes, that is the change, but what drove that change? ...We will get dirty trying to best understand
various firms and how to best use financial information. You need to be involved in these discussions.

How to do well and get the most out of the experience:

This class is also one that has a straightforward plan for success as directly affirmed by former students.
Students who truly commit to all of the following usually end up with solid grades: (1) consistently
preparing for class, using the materials provided and asking questions when needed; (2) being active
learners within the classroom and (3) thoughtfully reviewing the material (with peers) after class.
Individuals who do not do or want to do the work, check out during class or miss class, believe they
know everything, maintain a closed mind or refuse to be thoughtful usually find this class to be dreadful.Financial Statement Analysis: Dr. Patrick Badolato Summer 2020

A Broader Background of the Course
Our objectives include:
e Increase our understanding of financial filings (including financial statements, managers’ commentaries,
footnotes and other sources of financial information) in order to:

o Understand how firms operate and create value—we put considerable emphasis on understanding
how financial information helps us understand and guide operating decisions.

o Concisely articulate the firm’s past—without this, valuation and forecasting could be misguided,
so we must be able to tell the story of the firm.

o Increase our understanding and ability to use tools to analyze information presented in financial
statements. Understand the benefits and limitations of financial information provided in financial
filings and the motivation for and process of making adjustments to this information—we will
adjust, change and challenge ratios, metrics and formulas to ensure they work in specific real-
world situations.

o Use our understanding of the firm and its financials to make informed predictions about future
performance—we will stress how understanding financial information provides us with an
excellent framework for considering the future.

o Motivate, understand, construct and implement various inputs in valuation models—we wil/ very
briefly note the mechanics of valuation while stressing the more useful and challenging steps of
motivating inputs to valuation. Valuation is not only a mindless mechanical exercise.

The course will be taught using a combination of examples, discussion questions, cases and homework problems.
We will learn new concepts using various firms’ historical and current financial data. To achieve these objectives,
during the semester we will learn a framework for business analysis and valuation. The steps in the framework
include:

(1) Business Strategy Analysis: The purpose of business strategy analysis 1s to assess the profit potential of
the firm at a qualitative level. This involves an understanding of the firm’s strategy and its industry and
considering how these affect and are affected by the firm’s financial performance.

(2) Financial Analysis: The purpose of financial analysis 1s to assess the firm’s historical financial
performance in the context of its goals and strategies. Tools used for financial analysis include ratio
analysis, cash flow analysis, and common-size financial statements. Ratio Analysis is not computing
ratios (i.e., division), but carefully using and changing ratios to provide us with information.

(3) Accounting Analysis: The purpose of accounting analysis is to develop an understanding of whether a
firm’s accounting captures its true underlying economic condition(s). This involves understanding
accounting transactions, identifying accounting flexibility, evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies and estimates, and at times, altering financial statements to enhance decision making.

(4) Valuation/Prospective Analysis: The purpose of valuation/prospective analysis 1s to forecast the firm’s
future financial performance and determine a potential valuation of the firm—our best assessment of
intrinsic value. To do this we will learn the mechanics and intricacies of forecasting financial statements
and we will (very briefly) note the components and usage of valuation models.

We will review (and learn) accounting concepts as this knowledge 1s critical to making decisions with financial
information. However, the primary objective of the course 1s not to improve our understanding of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP or IFRS); the goal is to improve our ability to interpret and use
financial statements in a variety of settings including a primary focus on credit and equity analyses and
supplemental coverage of corporate finance, planning and control. This is not a journal entry class; in fact, we
will likely not see any journal entries during the entire semester (unless specifically requested by students).Financial Statement Analysis: Dr. Patrick Badolato Summer 2020

Course Structure

The class format involves coverage of the main areas and tools noted above. In addition, there will be a
considerable amount of discussions/cases that focus on specific firms and specific financial issues. These
cases will involve a careful analysis of the financials, the opportunity to dig deeper to support (or
challenge) information that is presented, and the consideration of the benefits and limitations of various
tools, metrics and ratios.

The course will be taught using a combination of examples, discussion questions, cases and homework
problems. We will learn new concepts using various firms’ historical and current financial data.

A tentative schedule of class meetings is attached to the end of this document. This schedule may be
revised and all updates will be posted on Canvas or discussed in class.

Materials

Required: Cases, slides and other materials created by the professor and available on Canvas.
Students are required to access Canvas, read takeaways, exam questions, case feedback
commentaries and other class materials and post any unanswered questions directly to Canvas.
There is no substitute for the vast amount of information that will be on Canvas.

o To ensure the highest dissemination of information and to maintain a fair
playing field, all non-personal questions must be asked on the Discussion

Board and not emailed to me.
Required: It is required that you read, used and retained the materials and information from an
financial accounting class. Our course builds off these.
Recommended Text: The textbook for the course is Financial Reporting, Financial Statement Analysis
and Valuation: A Strategic Perspective by Wahlen, Baginski and Bradshaw, eighth edition. ISBN: 978-
1285190907
o The textbook 1s recommended for students who have not had sufficient exposure to the material we
cover in class. The class moves fast and assumes you mastered material from prior classes. We do
not have slides from, cover or read from the text; it provides background reading.
o Suggested Texts:

" Accounting for Value by Stephen Penman; Ben Graham’s The Intelligent Investor; Michael
Lewis’s The Big Short; Pat Dorsey’s The Little Book that Builds Wealth and Michael Shearn’s The
Investment Checklist: The Art of In-Depth Research. James Marshall’s The Three Little Pigs.
Business and economic-focused podcasts including Freakonomics, Planet Money and Masters in
Business. This is not a comprehensive list and I am open to your suggestions and will post more
on Canvas. That being said, it is worth emphasizing that quality (thoughtful use of the materials
we use In class) will be far more useful than quantity without thoughtfulness or mindfulness.

Throughout the course we will be examining publicly available material including corporate press
releases, corporate filings (10K ’s, etc.), analyst reports, and articles from the business press. When
appropriate, these and other supplemental information (or links to these documents) will be provided via
the Canvas. You will be responsible for downloading and printing these articles and using links posted on
Canvas. UT Box links expire 30 days after posting—please download the files you need in a timely
fashion.Financial Statement Analysis: Dr. Patrick Badolato Summer 2020

Structure, Materials and Logistics (page 2 of 2)
Topics 1-4 are very interdisciplinary

Topic 1: Here we offer an introduction to the course, what we will cover in terms of material and the pedagogical
approach. We will demonstrate these points with an in-class case. This, like all classes, offers an essential
background for the rest of the classes—we do not take a memorize and regurgitate approach and it 1s important to
discuss the why behind each lesson and perspective of the class. Moreover, we discuss the emphasis on a need for
a growth, not a fixed, mindset as well as the value of addressing common mistakes and their solutions.
Topic 2: Before delving into financial metrics, we take a step back to consider our understanding of the
company’s business and the need to seek and understand qualitative characteristics as well as the competition,
industry forces or other salient external factors. One goal here is to demonstrate that quantitative assessments may
keep us busy with calculations, but may not offer any value without a good qualitative understanding.
Topic 3: Here we cover a deep dive into both the quantitative and qualitative information presenting in a financial
filing beyond the financial statements. One goal is to demonstrate our need to move beyond the financial
statements to assess company performance. Another is to show examples of how this is done and why.
Topic 4: Here we bring ratios and financial metrics into our analysis. Instead of focusing on memorizing or
computing ratios, we emphasize why and how we use them, why and how they may need to be adjusted, and how
we can apply certain ratios when examining specific businesses. One goal here is to discuss commonly
misunderstood or misused ratios. 4b extends the point to discuss how we can use the Income Statement to assess
profitability, 4c focuses on the Balance Sheet to assess efficiencies and 4d ends with the Statement of Cash Flows.

Although this is an interdisciplinary class, we also need to develop comfort with material area of financial
reporting. Therefore, our Accounting Analysis classes (5-9) focus on deeper dives into specific areas.

Topic 5: Here we emphasize understanding the specifics of revenue recognition (what, why, how, when... and
what comes next). One goal here is to show how the idea of products or services 1s massively outdated and needs
to be updated to assess how nearly all modern-day companies focus on mixing products and services.
Topic 6: This follows the idea of Topic 5 with an emphasis on understanding cash flows. One takeaway here 1s
that although cash flows can be over-simplified and we can over-emphasize the mindless counting of cash in
valuation processes, It is important to assess the discretion, flexibility and overall challenges we face when trying
to understand cash flows. As an extension of the prior Topic, we elaborate to explore issues with liquidity and
working capital (6b) and capital expenditures (6c), As these are areas that affect valuation, one goal is to ensure
we understand the choices made, their impact on current and performance and whether these are sustainable.
Topic 7: The emphasis here is on understanding Taxes, the Tax Footnote and the impact of taxes on other areas
(valuation, cash flows, etc.). One takeaway here is that taking a superficial focus on Taxes (statutory rates, tax
shields, etc.) is likely incomplete.
Topic 8: The emphasis here is on understanding risks that companies face and their use of operating and financial
hedges and derivatives. One takeaway is the broad understanding of the use of hedges to mitigate risks and the de-
emphasis of financial products.
Topic 9: Here the focus is on Financial Arrangements as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. One goal here
is to show why we need to understand the specifics of these arrangements and utilize the footnotes to achieve this
goal.

We wrap things up by assessing drivers of value and coupling this with Forecasting and Valuation
Topic 10: Combining both mechanical and qualitative skills, here we focus on applying our prior lessons,
including obtaining and using information to guide our forecasting process.

Topic 11: Here we focus on applying our prior lessons to guide our valuation process. We also emphasize that we
are valuing businesses, not earnings or cash flows and therefore it is our assessment of the company, not the
model we choose, that influences our estimates of value.

Topic 12: This Topic serves as a reminder of how and why the specific of our classes can be applied to a variety
of companies, including how we try to understand what drives their performance and their intrinsic value.Financial Statement Analysis: Dr. Patrick Badolato Summer 2020
Assignments and Grading Information (page 1 of 5)

Disclaimer: The following contains extensive details about each part of the class and expectations.
If this seems excessively specific and elaborate, | apologize in advance.

Course Requirements and Grading

We will determine the final distribution of letter grades at the end of the semester. This means that
numerical scores on specific assignments do not correspond to a particular letter grade prior to the end
of the semester. Final grades are determined by summing up all pieces, then ranking all students and
then following the class distribution provided by the respective Program(s). Some areas of the
distribution may be very tight. This means that it is mathematically unavoidable that some students
with similar grades do not get the exact same final letter grades. Ultimately, someone must fall at each
“break point,” which means that someone gets the lowest of one grade (for example, the lowest A-) and
someone else, with similar grades, gets the highest of the next letter grade (for example, the highest B+).
The class’s distribution dictates the percentage of each of the letter grades. That is, you and your
classmates’ performance, more than I, determine your final letter grade. Moreover, with a distribution-
based grading scheme, such as we use this Program, proximity to a specific cutoff point is an irrelevant
point as in order for a student close to but below the cutoff to receive the higher grade, a student with a
higher grade would be forced to simultaneously drop a letter grade, which is both unfair and illogical.
Students may not ask for exclusive extra credit or grade changes at the end of the semester. This 1s
unprofessional and requesting specific treatment violates our University’s academic goals.

The letter grades will be determined by the guidelines set out by the MBA and MPA Programs for
upper-level classes. Numerical points will be accumulated as follows:

Cases (40%)

The primary objective of the Cases is to help you gain exposure to the material before attending class. The fancy
term for this is the “flipped classroom,” but this 1s simply old-fashioned education from your rather old-school
professor that helps ensure you can master the material by getting exposure and taking direct ownership (which is
not new or novel idea at all). This is not a class in which I lecture at you all semester long and you passively take
notes, so case preparation before class 1s essential. As these cases are not simply mechanical or term/theory
regurgitation, you will likely encounter ambiguity and have questions as you complete the cases—this 1s by
design. Unless clearly noted otherwise, all Cases are due before class, before any of the sections have class.

There are numerous cases required by all students and associated each of the classes. Details are provided
on Canvas. All assignments should be submitted electronically through Canvas using a program that is
compatible with Microsoft Office. Students are responsible for uploading the final version, checking and re-
checking any issue with formatting or other errors before submission. Students may not drop or miss any
assignments. The work is too important to miss and the costs to a student of not doing each one (much like
missing class) are too high. However, if major events, issues or conflicts come up, students may turn in up to two
assignments late and still receive full credit. The late exemption is for any case submitted after the due date yet
within one week / before any keys are posted. After this, the third late assignment and beyond receive 50% off
penalties. This includes all submissions whether they are late by a few minutes or a few days. To be clear, the
submissions must be the student's own work, completed without the use of the answer keys (in any way).

Case Guidelines

Cases must be written in a professional manner. This means; write in complete sentences and paragraphs and
ensure that your answer and support is clear to your reader; use spellcheck (of course, these need to be typed):
report financial numbers in a professional way (e.g. the numbers are aligned and do not have seven decimal
places); and clearly label/number each of your responses (e.g. 1-5). You must provide support for all answers that
ask for it. Assignments that do not hit all of these criteria for professionalism or are not professional in another
way will get a 25% penalty for the first occurrence and then 50% or less credit thereafter. Assignments that are
late, but before class, will get a 25% penalty for the first occurrence and then 50% or less credit thereafter.
Assignments that are turned in after the class begins are not accepted.

Cases, Group Work, Collaboration and File Sharing.

Group work and collaboration are common in academia and the business world. Group work and collaboration do
not mean that individuals should plagiarize the work of others, misrepresent attribution, avoid doing any
meaningful work, or misreport information in any way.

In this class, unless otherwise noted, students must submit their own document for every Case completed
outside of class. In an effort to facilitate useful collaboration, unless noted otherwise, students are encouraged to
work in a group of up to three people on the Cases. The goal of allowing groups 1s to enable students to actively
share ideas, but still be involved—active discussions are the primary reason for allowing collaboration. Group
work means you are encouraged to discuss the questions and answers, not rely on or copy the work of others; that
is, each student needs his or her own submission, in which he or she adds value. As reiterated below, directly
sharing files or copying answer (including copied answers with minor edits) across group members and/or other
sroups or individuals is a violation of these policies and will not be accepted. At the minimum, a violation results
in a O for the case for all individuals involved in the violation. Specific examples are noted below.

Groups of four or more are not allowed and must split into smaller groups. There is a cap to group sizes as large
eroups remove the benefit from actively discussing the material.

Complete and honest attribution is required. Students must list the other people who they worked with on the
case. If a name is missing or does not match up, all members get a 25% penalty for the first transgression, a 50%
penalty for the second occurrence, and a 100% deduction thereafter.Financial Statement Analysis: Dr. Patrick Badolato Summer 2020

Assignments and Grading Information (page 3 of 5)

A non-exhaustive list of acceptable and unacceptable submissions:

I,

Acceptable: Three students work together in a breakout room and discuss the Case. Each student is
actively engaged in the discussion. Later they write up their answers and have some shared themes.
Each student directly acknowledges the collaboration of all three individuals.

Acceptable: Two students chat via a video call regarding a Case. Both students are actively
engaged in the discussion. The students write up their answers as they discuss and have some
shared themes, but also take different approaches on many of the questions. Both students directly
acknowledge the collaboration.

Unacceptable for both students: Student A asks Student B for Student B’s work. Student B
emails/post the file to a shared folder. Student A makes minor edits and submits the case and tries
to make it look like collaboration. Both students note each other’s name on the submission. For
example:

The most informative metric regarding profitability for this company is operating margin. The main
reason for this is that there are a variety of expenses, other than cost of sales, which are essential for
this company’s sustained operating success, including as Research and Development, Selling and
Marketing expenses. These expenses are critical as innovation and customer acquisition and
retention are critical in this industry. During this period, the company’s operating margin decreased
as it both lowered its prices in light of increased competition and began to spend more on R&D and
Selling and Marketing expenses, which increased to 10% and 12% of Revenue, respectively.
Operating Margin is the most informative metric regarding profitability for this company. This ts
because a few expenses other than cost of sales are essential for this company’s sustained operating
success, including as Research and Development (R&D), Selling and Marketing (S&M) expenses.
These expenses are critical as customer acquisition/retention and innovation are critical in this
company’s operating environment. During this period, the company’s operating margin decreased
for two main reasons. First, the company decreased its prices in light of increased competition.
Second, the company began to spend more on S&M and R&D expenses, which are currently 12%
and 10% of Revenue, which is an increase from 11% and 8%, respectively.

Unacceptable for both students: Student A asks for Student C’s work. Student C has already
worked with two other students and completed the Case, but sends the file to Student A anyway.
Student A makes numerous edits and submits the case. Student A notes that he worked alone.
Unacceptable for all students: Student A asks for Student C’s work. Student C has already worked
with Student B and completed the Case, but sends the file to Student A anyway. Student A makes
edits and submits the case. Student A notes that he worked with Student C, Student B notes that she
worked with Student C, Student C notes that he worked with Students A and B.

If this appears complex, the simple solution is business professionalism: work alone or if you

choose to work together as group, do so as an actual group and have direct, honest and complete

communication across all group members.Financial Statement Analysis: Dr. Patrick Badolato Summer 2020

Assignments and Grading Information (page 4 of 5)
Class participation and leadership (25%)
Much of class is conducted in a discussion setting during which we will analyze specific firms and
discuss which metrics are important, the reasons for our approach, and the implications of our choices.
The assignments are geared to prepare you to participate in and learn from these discussions.
Accordingly, your completion of the assignments and your participation in our discussions are vital. If
you are not involved in the discussion on your own, you should prepare for cold calling. At times, I will
only be a facilitator of your discussions with each other. After most classes, I will make class notes, with
particular attention to the quality of comments or guestions, not the quantity. You do not need to be
correct to participate: insightful questions and thoughtful answers are also important and I encourage
students to answer, even when they are unsure. Moreover, a strong, smart and vibrant academic
community is a part of why you and your classmates are here at the University of Texas.

Consistent with what is noted above and in light of the expectations of this program and surely your
jobs, you are clearly expected, but not forcibly required, to attend all classes. As your absence can
detract from the learning experience of others, if you will miss part of or a whole class, you should post
to our Discussion Board before (or after) class when this occurs (there is a relevant area of Canvas set up
for this). The post can include an apology to your classmates, if sincere, and can include whatever
information you believe is both personally and professionally prudent. If, for any reason, you are
uncomfortable posting the circumstance to the class, you may email me. That being said, you do not
need to apologize to me—you and your classmates, not I, lose out from your absence. If you miss class
you should obtain the slides, talk to your colleagues (classmates) about the course materials and
discussions and post any unresolved issues to the Discussion Board.

Here’s a general idea of how I plan to grade your class participation over the course of the semester:

e Outstanding Contributor: Consistent and sustained contributions to large-group discussions reflect thorough
preparation. Ideas offered are usually substantive, provide good insights and sometimes change the direction
of the class for the better. Arguments, when presented, are generally well-substantiated and often persuasive.
If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of the large-group discussions would be diminished
significantly. In addition to exceptional large-group discussion contributions, also actively participates in
small-group discussions.

e Good Contributor: Consistent contributions to large-group discussions reflect satisfactory preparation. Ideas
offered are usually substantive, generally provide useful insights, and occasionally offer a new direction for
the discussion. Arguments, 1f presented, are reasonably well-substantiated. If this person were not a member
of the class, the quality of the large-group discussions would be diminished. In addition, also offers
comments in small-group discussions.

e Marginal Contributor: Generally routine contributions to large-group discussions reflect preparation. Ideas
offered are occasionally substantive but seldom provide clear insights or new directions for the discussion.
Arguments may be occasionally presented that are interesting, but are generally not well-substantiated. If
this person were not a member of the class, the quality of the large-group discussions would be diminished
only slightly. In addition, also offers consistent comments in small-group discussions.

e Non-participant (around 0-2 percentage points out of 10%): This person has maintained good attendance,
but has said little or nothing in class apart from the small group discussions; hence there is no adequate basis
for evaluation. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of the discussions would be
unchanged.

e Low attendance (0 percentage points out of 10%). This person has missed numerous classes or if present,
contributions to discussions reflect inadequate preparation. Ideas offered are rarely substantive, provide few,
if any, insights and never offer a constructive direction. At best, contributions are obscure, confused, and
indicate a lack of familiarity with the fact of the issues under discussion.

e Disruptive Contributor (negative points): Comments demonstrate disrespect for others in the academic
community. Student does not participate in small group discussions. If this person were not a member of
class, valuable airtime would be saved.Financial Statement Analysis: Dr. Patrick Badolato Summer 2020
Assignments and Grading Information (page 5 of 5)

o Disruption includes consistently arriving late, leaving or packing up early, side conversations,
or using a cell phone during class or other disruptive behaviors. I hope no one achieves this
grade as this represents a major lack of professionalism and respect for our University. A
student in this category may not pass the class, regardless of the other grades.

Our class will also make use of Discussion Board. This is the forum for outside-of-class questions
related to assignments, our class coverage and any related current events. In addition, as the Discussion
Board is an important way to share information and knowledge across the class, each student must post a
constructive question or comment or respond a class-related post at least once during the semester.
Moreover, constructive Discussion Board involvement can help enhance your Class Participation and
Leadership grade, but the primary driver of performance is the classroom experience. (Logistical
questions such as “Where is the Excel file?” are always welcomed, but cannot enhance your grade.)

Grading Disputes

My TA/grader and I make every effort to grade all of your work fairly and accurately, but grading errors
can occur. If you believe there is an error, you may request a re-grading of the assignment. Be aware,
however, that grading errors can occur in both directions - errors can make grades too high as well as too
low. Therefore, if you request a re-grading, your entire assignment will be re-graded, and all grading
errors will be corrected. By requesting a re-grade, you accept the possibility that your grade may go
either up or down. To request a re-grade, you must submit a written request to me within 72 hours from
the time in which the assignment’s grade was released to students (whether or not you were present in
class on that day or checking email). The request must be accompanied by the original, if I do not retain
it, and must state the area of dispute, your recommendation for change in grade, an explanation or
justification for your recommendation and any limitations to this recommendation. Moreover, the
request, should articulate (in person or in writing) how the submission compared to the discussion from
the class (and/or any posted materials). The re-grade request must refer to the guidelines established in
this syllabus and Canvas and not involve any misrepresentation or unprofessionalism.

Case Feedback

Informal discussions about how a student can perform better are allowed, but a student must articulate
(in person or in writing) the specifics of how their submission compared to the discussion from the class
(and any posted materials). The request must also include a direct discussion of any expectations noted
in this syllabus or on Canvas.

Formal or informal requests that do not abide by these policies will be considered unprofessional,
may not be addressed and can lead to a meaningfully lower grade.

The same policies apply to emails/notes about grades or other subjects that misrepresent facts,
avoid personal responsibility, do not answer pertinent questions, or are unprofessional in their
language, subject or approach.

Group Project (35%)
There will be one group project due towards the end of the semester, which will focus on evaluating
similar companies. More details will be posted on Canvas during the semester and/or noted in class.Financial Statement Analysis: Dr. Patrick Badolato Summer 2020

Academic Integrity and University Policies (page 1 of 2)

Cheating involves copying work across groups, cheating on the exam, plagiarizing your assignments and other
things as well. Don’t cheat as (1) it is wrong; (2) the costs far outweigh the benefits: you don’t want to get
kicked out in a short-sighted attempt to make a B a B+; and (3) there ts a very good chance that your cheating
will be revealed and we will all be extremely disappointed.

Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty

The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both
students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described 1n detail in the BBA Program’s Statement
on Scholastic Dishonesty at http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics.aspx. By teaching this course,
I have agreed to observe all faculty responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this class, you
have agreed to observe all student responsibilities described 1n that document. If the application of the Statement
on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments 1s unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me
for clarification. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty
harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to the Student Judicial Services website at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ to access the official University policies and procedures on scholastic
dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.

Canvas site for all sections, if there 1s more than one, of a course that I teach. This will allow students in other
sections to see that you are enrolled in the course and send you email from within Canvas. However, they will not
actually learn your email address and no other personal data will be revealed through Canvas. If you have any
concerns, please contact the ITS Help Desk at 475-9400 for help removing your name from view of other

and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety:

Title [X Reporting

Title [X is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault,
sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is
committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual
misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:

|. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.

2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become

involved in a Title LX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.

Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters”
which means that they are required to report violations of Title [X to the Title [X Coordinator. I am a Responsible
Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-
one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title LX related incident, be sure to ask
whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without
making an official report to the university, email advocate(@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting
options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title [X Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.Financial Statement Analysis: Dr. Patrick Badolato Summer 2020
