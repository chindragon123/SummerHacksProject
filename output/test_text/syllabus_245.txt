COURSE OBJECTIVES:

A. Develop an appreciation for the importance of cell biology, biochemistry and molecular biology in nutrient
uptake and metabolism.

B. Understand the basic concepts and importance of metabolic regulation at the whole body, organ and
cellular level.

C. Gain an understanding of how nutrients work alone and together to regulate physiological function.

D. Gain an appreciation for the roles of various organs (liver, muscle, adipose tissue) 1n macronutrient
metabolism.

E. Develop the critical thinking required to apply alterations in metabolism to cell function and disease
process.

F. Start to build problem solving skills to determine mechanisms for physiologic changes and uses in
macronutrient metabolism in disease states.

G. Build upon the metabolism learned in NTR 312 to prepare the students for NTR 342.

1. Prerequisites for NTR 326

Credit* in NTR 312 or 312H for Nutrition majors.
Nutrition 312 with a grade of at least C in each.

2. Students with disabilities.

Please notify me of any modification/adaptation you may require to accommodate a disability-related need.

used for exams.

THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP EXAMS. If an exam is missed, then that is your dropped
exam grade.

The material covered will be all the lecture material since the last exam.

Pay special attention to things that are highlighted or asterisked by me in lectures. These items are
more likely to be test questions.

All exams are multiple choice, open book, online.

Exam times are every Monday during class time.

Questions regarding exam grading should be made, in writing, to the instructor (Dr. Jolly). For
exam re-evaluation this must occur by the second class day following the return of the exam.

MANDATORY TEXT: Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism, sixth Edition,
Gropper/Smith/Groff, Thompson-Wadsworth, 2017. Reading assignments for this textbook are
given in the course outline.

The lecture material is derived from a mixture of cell biology, biochemistry and nutrition textbooks.

5. Lecture Notes

Y Handouts will be posted on Canvas.
vY Handouts serve as an outline of the key content of the class and supply many of the diagrams/figures
that we will discuss.

v All

lectures are recorded on zoom.6. Discussion sections:

> No new material will be presented.

>» Ashley Neely (the TA) leads the sections and will reinforce the lecture material.
> This is your time to gain clarification on lecture material.

> Bring your questions!
