for details). Each PT will evaluate the verbal fluency and the ability to improvise the conversation.

4. Homework will be given six times, one for each lesson. Homework will be posted on Canvas. The due
date for homework is marked in the tentative course schedule table. Homework will be graded based on
completion. Late homework will NOT be accepted without an official document to show the reason for
the delay. If anybody has any technical problems downloading or printing out homework from Canvas,
ask the instructor for assistance.
