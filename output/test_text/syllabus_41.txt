Appropriate Materials for the 21st Century
Instructor: Jen Wong / jenwong@utexas.edu

Teaching Assistant: Ernesto Bilbao / ebilbao@utexas.edu

This web-based course examines the global impacts of key materials used in the built environment. The built environment
- including our infrastructure, buildings, landscape, transportation systems, furniture, apparel, and all human-made or
manipulated objects - is in constant evolution. Underlying these changes is the discovery, development, and
implementation of raw materials. The impact of our collective material use increases as human population and resource
consumption grow in size and complexity - leading one to ask, “What materials are most appropriate for the 21st
Century?” This course examines the criteria by which we determine whether a material is “appropriate” - introducing a
range of materials, strategies, and precedents.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Comprehension of material consumption and production in the built environment, based on an understanding of
material evolution from prehistory to the present

Comprehension of the complex environmental, socioeconomic, and ethical challenges that result from current
and projected material use in the built environment

Knowledge of materials and strategies that offer solutions to these challenges

Knowledge of a wide range of products and buildings around the world that utilize appropriate materials and
material strategies

Development of critical thinking and writing skills

Development and articulation of a rigorous material manifesto

COURSE FORMAT

The course is asynchronous; there are no set meeting times, but regular deadlines
The course is entirely web-based; all materials are accessed and submitted via Canvas
The course is divided into three parts; each part is comprised of four modules
In addition to twelve teaching modules, there is one introduction module
Teaching modules contain the following elements:
Lessons: narrated slideshow lectures and text
Multi-media content: required readings, films, clips, podcast
Discussion post prompt
