Gregory J. Rodin, Professor
The University of Texas at Austin
Department of Aerospace Engineering
and Engineering Mechanics

G.J. Rodin is Professor in the Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics
Department at The University of Texas at Austin, where he has been teaching since 1986. He
earned his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1986. He is also a member of the Institute for Computational and Engineering Sciences, Texas
Materials Institute, and Institute for Theoretical Chemistry. He was awarded Research Initiation
Grant by the National Science Foundation in 1987, ALCOA Foundation Awards in 1991 and
1993, and was chosen as a Temple Foundation Fellow in 1995. He held visiting positions in
France at Ecole Normale Superior (Department of Earth, Atmosphere, and Oceans) and Ecole
Polytechnique (Laboratory of Solid Mechanics) and United Kingdom at University of Liverpool
(Applied Mathematics).

Dr. Rodin is committed to the highest standards of undergraduate education and regularly
teaches large sections of the undergraduate Statics (EM 306) and Mechanics of Solids (EM 319)
courses. Also he has been involved in teaching five graduate courses, two of which were new
courses that he introduced.

Dr. Rodin's primary research interests are in micromechanical modeling and simulation of
heterogeneous materials, and he is also interested in various aspects of applied mathematics and
fluid mechanics. He has published papers in the leading journals in numerical methods, solid
mechanics, fluid mechanics, materials science, and arctic engineering. He has delivered about
one hundred and fifty invited talks in USA, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan,
Netherlands, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. His research has been sponsored by the National
Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, Army Research Office, Department of Energy,
Sandia National Laboratories, Texas Advanced Technology Program, ALCOA, Martin Marietta,
Nippon Mining Co. (Japan) and Schlumberger R&D.

Dr. Rodin is a co-founder of Computational Fracture Mechanics Associates LLC, which

provides consulting services in the area of design and simulation of hydraulic fracturing
processes.
