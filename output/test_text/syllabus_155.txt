but to learn how to avoid being deceived by economists." Joan Robinson, 1955

Description

This course builds on the material presented in Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECO 304L).
Major theoretical concepts, analysis tools, and empirical regularities are explored in the context
of issues facing the United States and other economies.

By the end of the course, students should be able to address three sets of questions. (1) What
determines the performance of an economy (e.g., its growth rate, its unemployment rate)? (2) In
what ways are macroeconomies adjusting to technological innovations? (3) What are the
principle similarities and peculiarities among 21‘ century macroeconomies?

The prerequisite for this course is ECO 420K. If your transcript does not show
credit for ECO 420K, with a grade of “C minus” or better

you will be dropped from this course;

you are advised to adjust your schedule now
(no economics courses may be added after the fourth class meeting).

 

Materials & Meetings

The required text is Macroeconomics, 2nd Edition, by Frederic Mishkin (© 2015).
Additional materials will be placed on Canvas.

Synchronous class meetings will occur via Zoom (through Canvas) beginning on Friday,
5 June (10 to 10:50am CDT) and most MWFE thereafter through Wednesday, 8 July. Please
make every effort to join these meetings. All meetings will be recorded and posted along with
relevant materials on Canvas. Recorded asynchronous lectures will be posted on Canvas, also.
To accommodate quizzes and exams, synchronous class meetings will not occur on 8 June, 12
June, 22 June, 29 June, and 6 July.

Expectations

Lectures consist primarily of extensions and applications of topics in the Mishkin text. I
will alert the class to common errors and easily overlooked subtleties. To learn
macroeconomics, you must take an active role. Your tasks include reading the assigned
chapters, joining synchronous meetings (as much as possible), and viewing recorded lectures.ECO f320L (79465), summer 2020 2

As you identify concepts and procedures you find unclear, please give me opportunity to help.
To encourage active learning, there will be three quizzes posted on Canvas, which will serve as
diagnostic “‘pre-tests,” revealing to what extent you are prepared to perform well on exams, and
where you might need additional efforts and/or help.

Office hours will be accessed via Zoom. Do not hesitate to request a Zoom meeting at
whatever day/time is best for you.

Please let me know immediately if you have any problem that is preventing you from
performing satisfactorily in this class. Any student with a documented disability who requires
academic accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at
http://ddcetest.info/disability/contact-us/.

Exams and Grading
There will be three mid-term exams and a comprehensive final exam (dates are provided

below). Final grades will be based on the three highest exam scores; if you are satisfied with
your scores on the mid-term exams, you need not take the final exam.

Weights used to calculate final grades

quizzes 10%
mid-term exams 30% x 3, or 25% x 2
final exam (optional) 40%

Each student will receive 10/3 points per quiz. Quiz answer keys will be posted on
Canvas within 48 hours of the quiz itself.

The final exam score is included in the grade computation only if doing so raises your
grade. If so, the final exam is weighted 40%, and the two highest mid-term scores are weighted
25% each.

Exams are based on class lectures. Familiarity with Mishkin's coverage of the material is
required to understand the lectures and to perform well on exams. Exam questions involve
graphs, algebra, and economic logic (cause & effect). Grades on each exam are curved up to a
class average of 70%. (If the class average is not below 70%, the curve is zero points.)

See below for dates of exam posting and when answers are due. If you are able and so
inclined, you may collaborate with others while devising your answers. You are expected to
uphold the highest standards of academic integrity: each answer you submit must be genuinely
your own.

As aconvenience, grades are posted on Canvas. The numbers on Canvas do not
supersede grading policies as expressed in this syllabus. For example, the curve on each
exam will be announced in class meetings and applied in determining the grades reported to the
Registrar.ECO f320L (79465), summer 2020 3
