ue 3.L8Gr.P.I. Homework Assignment Policy

All written homework assignments must be scanned into pdf and upload to the appropriate
assignment on Canvas before class time (10:00 am) on the due days.

Late submission: Only one late homework assignment in each category will be accepted. You
will receive a zero (0) grade for all the subsequent late homework assignments.

If you are absent on the day when a homework assignment is due, you should still submit/upload
the assignment on time unless you are sick and unable to complete the assignment. If that is the
case, that assignment can be submitted on the day you return to class without being considered
late. If you forget to turn it in on the first day you return to class, it will be considered a late
homework.

Traditional or simplified characters: There are two versions for character writing: traditional and
simplified versions. The traditional version is used in Tatwan and some overseas communities;
the simplified version is used in Mainland China. You can only choose one version for writing,
and that is also the version you should use when typing in Chinese during tests. Characters
written or typed in the other version will be counted as mistakes. However, you are required to
recognize/read both versions, as they both will be used in the tests and quizzes.

The following rules are also applied to students who take this class for “pass/fail”.

1. Each day’s class will consist of two sessions (Class 1 and Class 2) separated by a 15-minute
break. Being absent from one session is considered one (1) absence. Therefore, if you miss one
day of class, 1t would be counted as two (2) absences.

2. Absence time is counted by the minute. Each accumulated 25 minutes, tardiness and early
departure included, is considered 1/3 absence.

3. Note that, coming to class without the Translation Homework (T Hw) draft is counted as half
(0.5) an absence, and without the Grammar Practice draft is counted as 0.25 absence.

4. Each student is allowed a maximum of three absences (1.5 class day or 225 minutes) without
penalty. No excuses need to be given for these absences. Each subsequent absence (or 75
minutes) will result in a deduction of 0.5 point from your Class Participation score. No excuses
for these subsequent absences will be accepted.

5. Six (6) or more absences, the penalty-free ones included, during this term will cause your
semester grade to be lowered by one full grade (e.g., A or A- will become B).

6. Twelve (12) absences, the penalty-free ones included, will automatically result in an F grade for
this course.

possible scholastic dishonesty. Any dispute between the instructor and the student on this
issue will be resolved at the Office of the Dean of Students.

information will be sent out via e-mails or be posted on Canvas Announcement. It is the
student’s responsibility to make sure that such announcements/materials/ information can
be received in a timely fashion.

Students who must miss a class, a quiz/test or an assignment in order to observe a
religious holy day will be given the opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time after the absence and will not be considered absent for that day. However,
