CURRENT RESEARCH INTERESTS

Research interests and foci includes: (1) examining the effects of nutrition and physical activity behaviors on the
reduction of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome; (2) examining the role of body fat and cultural
related factors on obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome; (3) developing lifestyle interventions that
include nutrition and physical activity behavior modifications focused on childhood obesity prevention; and (4)
developing ways to promote healthy lifestyles through health education and theoretical based health behavior
models.

INTERNATIONAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERIENCE

ProWorld Volunteer, Cape Coast, Ghana. June 2010 — August 2010. Worked with HIV/AIDS patients in hospital
to ensure that each patient received proper antiretroviral and protease inhibitor medications, doctor consultations,
and medical advice. Weighed malnutritioned infants and provided mothers with fortified sachet powders. Lectured
at various local schools on topics of nutrition, drugs and alcohol, environmental health, personal hygiene, disease
prevention, and hand washing. Developed budget for use of 100 Ghanaian cedi (equivalent to 45 U.S. dollars) to
purchase buckets and trash bins for local schools to use in hand washing, and for trash in effort to prevent disease.
Educated and lectured community members about nutrition, and conducted individual consultations, gathered blood
pressure and weight readings for community members.
