To Whom It May Concern:

| am writing to express my deep interest in the Lecturer position at The University of Texas at Austin:
McCombs School of Business: Department of Marketing. Having taught principles of marketing, social
media/digital as well as strategic communications at UT’s Center for Professional Education for 15 years,

| can tell you that marketing is an absolute passion of mine. Every day | read and search for what is next for
both my professional clients and the students | teach. To further illustrate, here are a few examples:
= From my earliest days in the public relations field, | found ways to combine multimedia, reputation
management and traditional marketing approaches to increase my client’s brand and product
visibility while helping drive sales. These steps led me to be named the youngest vice presidents at
one of the leading PR firms, Shandwick, before | was 30.
= | saw the role social could play in marketing and started one of the first corporate social media
departments at AMD in 2006. My effectiveness with this new venture help me secure one of the
largest budgets within the marketing and communications department.
=» See the power of this new medium and channel, | created social media agency focused on influencer
relations and content marketing in 2007. My campaigns won top honors from the Word of Mouth
Marketing Association (WOMMA), Summit International, ad:tech and Promo Magazine and many
others.
= Most recently, | have seen how digital can transform and organization’s marketing and have created
an agency to help clients such as Amazon, HP and DXC build truly digital marketing and sales
functions within numerous parts of their organization.
# Finally, | have co-authored 2 books on digital and marketing with my latest entitled, The Digital
Helix. This book recently became a Wall Street Journal bestseller and focuses on how organizations
can build a digital DNA to drive their growth and overall success.

 

In short, | look forward to each and every class | teach. | am invigorated by mere thought and process of
updating my materials, cases and examples long before the class. Once the class is here, | can’t wait to
challenge myself to inspire my students and push them towards to marketing avenues and heights they never
thought were possible. Since almost all of the classes | teach have a mix of working professionals,
entrepreneurs and those just entering the workforce, it is a real thrill to see and hear how my lessons help
them in their marketing journey. This is why | am sending my curriculum vitae and reference letters as | hope
to challenge and inspire the next set of marketing leaders at the McCombs School. | look forward to discussing
this position with you in the weeks to come. If you require any additional information, please feel free to
contact me and thank you for your time and consideration.

| am writing to recommend Chris Aarons for the position of Lecturer in the
Marketing Department at McCombs. This recommendation is based on the ten
years in which | have known and worked with Chris.

Chris is a genuine thought leader on the topic of digital and social approaches to
marketing. Throughout his career, he has executed many successful marketing
consulting engagements with a wide range of clients and written several books.

Significantly, Chris has shown a strong ability to translate his knowledge of
marketing into effective education. For the last decade, Chris has taught
marketing classes at the UT Center for Professional Education. | had the
opportunity to team-teach several classes with Chris before | joined McCombs. |
found Chris to be very effective in using his “war stories” to bring the classroom
to life and help cement the key concepts with his students. He takes his teaching
very seriously and | believe his students get a great deal of value from his
teaching style.

Chris would make an excellent addition to the McCombs instructor staff, teaching
either general marketing courses or any number of social and/or digital topics. |

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Bill Peterson
512-797-5690To Whom It May Concern,

| would like to personally recommend Chris Aarons for the role of Lecturer in the Marketing
Department at The University of Texas McCombs School of Business.

Previously, | worked as a digital consulting intern on Chris’ team at PulsePoint Group. As a
student of The University of Texas at the time, | was extremely grateful to be managed and
mentored by someone with Chris’ experience. | was relatively new to the area of digital
consulting, but Chris’ hands-on teaching approach allowed me to rapidly grow in a diverse and
stimulating environment. He was a strong team leader that constantly challenged me to think
through new perspectives on how technology was shaping the business landscape. Despite the
busy nature of PulsePoint Group at the time, Chris was also extremely approachable and
mindful of my development as an intern.

He went above and beyond in his role as my manager during my internship and was the first
person | thought of contacting when making my career decisions around graduation. He not
only took the time to walk me through his own personal experience in the workforce, but also
gave me sound advice on career considerations and growth opportunities beyond my major.
His insights and guidance during my time at The University of Texas have been invaluable to my
professional development.

| strongly believe that Chris will be an outstanding Lecturer and mentor to future McCombs
students, and am excited to see the impact he can make at The University of Texas.

If you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
Katherine Fan

To Whom It May Concern,

It is my pleasure and honor to recommend Chris Aarons for the position of marketing lecturer at McCombs
School of Business. Chris and I have collaborated for almost seven years on a number of professional education
programming offered through the Center for Professional Education within the Texas Extended Campus at the
University of Texas at Austin. During this time, I have witnessed how his unique industry-based knowledge,
paired with his exceptional skills in mentoring and teaching, has greatly contributed to the success of our
programs and students.

As an instructor, Chris has consistently demonstrated a unique ability to balance the demands of various
stakeholders, including sponsors, faculty, and university administrators. He has applied this focus to serve a
diverse student population. Notably, Chris has received exemplary reviews and feedback consistently for the 14
years he’s taught traditional and social/digital marketing and strategic communications in our program.

Leveraging his background and extensive experience in digital marketing, PR, entrepreneurship and small
business management, Chris has also served as an excellent resource for the Center for Professional Education
as he assists in curriculum development in a wide range of subjects. He continually shows a keen understanding
of both the university’s and the students’ needs in the courses he has developed. As a university administrator
who regularly evaluates and hires program faculty, I recognize that this transferability of skills is a rare quality
and would bring great value to any McCombs program.

Chris has my highest recommendation for the lecturer position. Iam confident he would be an excellent
addition to your faculty. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding his candidacy.
