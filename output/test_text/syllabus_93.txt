Course description

An introduction to ecology, the study of relationships among organisms and between
organisms and their environment; adaptations, population, communities, and
ecosystems. Includes both plants and animals and both terrestrial and aquatic
ecosystems. Prerequisite: Biology 325 or 325H with a grade of at least C-.

Rationale
Ecology is one of the upper-division courses available to fulfill a BS or BA in Biology.
Course Goals

Goal 1: Realize that events in the natural world are interconnected.

Goal 2: Understand that interactions in the natural world are governed by physical and
biological principles.

Goal 3: Realize that ecological interactions are simultaneously influenced by processes
acting at multiple temporal and spatial scales.

Goal 4: Appreciate that humans are a component of the natural world.

Goal 5: Realize that scientists use several approaches to study connections in nature.
Goal 6: Hone your observational, critical thinking, and communication skills while
developing an ecological inquiry

Course learning objectivesBy the end of this course you should be able to:

9.

Distinguish the different types of ecological systems found in nature

Explain how interactions between biological entities and their environment can
affect other biological entities and potentially lead to unexpected consequences.
Explain how much energy and matter enter and move through ecological
systems.

Compare how dynamic steady states are maintained and regulated in some
ecological systems but not in others.

Explain how evolution opens up new interacting possibilities in ecological
systems.

Explain how patterns and processes at each level of ecological organization are
intrinsically linked in a web of cause and effect with those occurring at different
levels.

Outline how humans have virtually affected all ecological systems on Earth.
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of using mensurative or
manipulative experiments across, field, lab, mathematical and simulation settings
to test ecological working hypothesis.

Identify a pattern in nature and develop a working hypothesis to explain it.

Format

Lecture: During lecture we will discuss the fundamental principles in Ecology, and work
towards the assessment of your knowledge. In-class activities and exercises will be
implemented during lecture. Lecture assignments will be given as homework at the end
of each lecture to help you better learn the course material. The lecture assignments will
provide extra credit for your final course grade. Weekly quizzes will be posted in Canvas
each F (last one on TH) at the beginning of lecture time.

Discussion: During discussion you will have a Q & A session about the lecture material
using the questions you will submit in the Canvas discussion. You will also do some
practice exercises to help you understand difficult aspects of the lecture material.

Assignments, assessment, and evaluation

Preliminary information on assignments and evaluations:

a. Weekly quizzes: there will be one practice quiz and 5 official quizzes. The
quizzes will focus on lecture material presented during the week. Quizzes
will be done through Canvas. Each student will receive a unique quiz.
Quizzes will be open book BUT NOT open to collaboration with peers.
Quizzes will consist of 16 multiple answer multiple choice and 4 brief/short
answer questions.

b. Lecture assignments: include short exercises and questions. These
individual assignments will be evaluated as participation and will count as
extra credit towards your final grade. They will be submitted via Canvas.
The lowest 2 lecture assignments will be dropped.c. Discussion attendance and assignments: attendance Is required for
discussion; you can make either of the two scheduled times on T and TH,
but must attend one each day. There will be ~ 9 discussion activities.
These activities will help you understand difficult course content. Detailed
instructions will be provided in Canvas. The lowest 1 will be dropped.

d. Self-guided field trip: a self-guided field trip will be assigned at the
beginning of the course. Detailed instructions on the assignment will be
provided in Canvas.

e. Final exam: there will be no final exam in this course.

Course Procedures

 

Class behavior, attendance, and participation policy:

1. Expected behavior: to make our time together as valuable as possible, we all
have to work hard at it. The following two basic principles provide some
guidelines: I) Every student has the right to learn as well as the
responsibility not to deprive others of their right to learn. Il) Every studentis accountable for his or her actions. |n order for you to get the most of this
class, please consider the following:
a. Attend all scheduled lectures and discussions and arrive on time.

Late arrivals and early departures are disruptive and violate the first
basic principle listed above. Lecture attendance will provide you the first
exposure to the material being covered in the course. Lectures and
discussions will be recorded. Try to get in the habit of attending the
lectures. Lecture attendance is not required but is highly recommended.
Discussion attendance is required.

In-class participation is highly sought after during the course. We want you
to feel free to express your opinions, arguments or questions about the material
being presented. You will be able to unmute your microphone or use the chat
feature in Zoom. We will also use Zoom poll to communicate.

Policy concerning make-ups: there are no make-up quizzes, assignments or
other evaluations unless a justified reason per UT policy or a documentable
emergency occurs. A documentable emergency needs to be communicated
through the Student Emergency Services. You need to contact your instructor
immediately for documentable emergencies and two weeks before being
absent for a justified absence.

guide your course readings and will provide a road map of what you need to
know to do well in your quizzes. Always use the learning objectives to
prepare for your quizzes. Lecture power points and learning objectives will
be posted in Canvas under modules before each lecture.

Use of Canvas

In this class | use Canvas to distribute lecture materials, to communicate, to
collaborate online, to post grades, and to submit assignments. You can find
support for Canvas at ITS Help Desk at 475-9400 or you can check the student
tutorial here: httos://utexas.instructure.com/courses/633028/pages/student-
tutorials. You will submit your assignments through Canvas. Please learn how to
correctly submit assignments in Canvas.

Use of Piazza

This term we will be using Piazza for rapid class communication. The system is
highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA,
and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, | encourage you
to post your questions on Piazza. Our class Piazza page can be accessed
directly on Canvas or via the link below. If you haven’t used Piazza before,
please check out their student support page - this page has step-by-step guides
to help with posting, replies, private messaging, and more.

Support page: https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/folders/48000404468

 

Use of email

When emailing instructors, please use a subject line. The subject should begin
with BIO 373: and include an informative statement about the topic of your email.
For example, BIO 373: Question about lecture 8. You also must include your
name in the body of your email. This will help us prioritize your messages from all
the other correspondence received. We will attempt to answer all email in a
timely manner. Be aware that some email may trigger spam filters and therefore
not get delivered. Check with the instructor if you do not receive a reply.

Use of Class Materials
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to quizzes, and

homework assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying
of the class materials is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinaryactions being taken against the student. Additionally, the sharing of class
materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a
violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic
dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action. This includes, among
other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing
those materials with other current or future students.

University Notices and Policies

Special accommodations

As per University policy, you must inform the instructor of any special concerns by the
12th class day. Special concerns include University excused absences and special
accommodations in-class and during evaluations.

Academic misconduct: We expect you to behave with integrity and to follow University
policies regarding academic honesty. Scholastic dishonesty on any quiz or assignment
will result in a failing grade (F) which you may not drop, and will be reported to the Dean
of Students.

Q drop: The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops
for academic reasons to six, please try to think clearly whether dropping this or any
other course is wise after the official date.

Title IX Reporting

Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination,
sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and
stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering
a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When
sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can: 1. Intervene to prevent
harmful behavior from continuing or escalating. 2. Provide support and remedies to
students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved in a
Title IX investigation. 3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant
policies. Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of
Texas universities, including faculty, report any information to the Title IX Office
regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is
disclosed to them. Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive any
information of this type (including, but not limited to, writing assignments, class
discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. |!am a Responsible
Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in
writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or
staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a
responsible employee. If you would like to speak with someone who can provide
support or remedies without making an official report to the university, please
email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and
resources, visithtip://www.titleix.utexas.edu, contact the Title IX Office via email

at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512-471-0419. Although graduate teaching and
research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still
mandatory reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a widerange of behaviors we refer to as sexual misconduct, including the types of
sexual misconduct covered under Texas Senate Bill 212. The Title IX office has
developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to
support Survivors.
