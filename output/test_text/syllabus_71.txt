Chemistry of Life

 

Biochemistry is a branch of science involved in
elucidating the structure, organization and
function of living systems in molecular terms.
We will see the themes of rhythm, balance, and
order in multiple applications. One of the main
tenets of biochemistry is the close relationship
between structure and function — and this we
will see repeated numerous times. Much of
what we discuss will relate to energy use and
generation. For example, how does that
hummingbird get the energy it needs for flight?
| look forward to sharing this science with you as

we investigate together the molecular wonders
of life!

We will be following a blended learning model including assignments
before, during and after class. Most lecture material is included in pre-
recorded videos, though there will be some lecturing in class. This
model has proven especially helpful in learning this subject and is
intended to help you divide the material into more bite-sized pieces.

 

Modules and Module Quizzes (10%)

Students will complete a Module prior to each class period, composed of several pre-recorded
short videos (2-5 min/each) related to the topic for the day. Each module also contains a Module
Quiz comprised of 5 multiple-choice questions that must be completed % hour before the
lecture period. The modules and quizzes are intended to foster familiarity with the subjects so
that we can devote most of our time in lecture to problem solving. You do NOT need to be
content experts before class — you just need to be somewhat familiar with the topics. Students
will get 2 attempts for each quiz (24 quizzes, total) and your 2 lowest scores will be dropped. The
final page of each module contains videos of material that students are responsible for — but
these do not need to be reviewed prior to class (“post-lecture” videos).

Squarecap and Lecture (15%)

We will be using the Squarecap system for in-class questions and problems. Students are
encouraged to work through the problems in a collaborative way — engaging with other students
as well as with TA’s. After we work through a set of problems, we will review the concepts behind
the solutions and take time to clarify any points or address questions that might arise. Some of
the more challenging topics will be addressed as live mini lectures in class — serving also to
reduce the number of videos required before lecture. Lectures will be conducted using Zoom
and will be recorded. Recordings will be posted on the day following lecture. Attendance is
required for the lectures scheduled on Monday thru Wednesday. Lecture time on Thursday
will be an optional review of the material prior to the weekend assignments (HW and EQ).

Each Squarecap question is scored as 1 point for completion and 1 point for accuracy. Since the
number of questions will vary with each lecture, grades are uploaded as percentages. A grade of
80% or higher in Squarecap will equate to a 100% score in Canvas — in other words only 80%
accuracy is required for 100% credit. There will be a total of 24 Squarecap grades and your
lowest two scores will be dropped.

OWL Homework (15%)

Students will have an OWL HW assignment due each weekend on topics covered in lecture.
Coupled with our work in class, these will help students achieve a deeper understanding of the
topics. These assignments are due Sundays by 11 pm (see schedule below) and will include 3
chapters of material — 10 questions each. There are a total of 8 HW assignments and your lowest
score will be dropped. Students are encouraged to complete the HW assignment first, in
preparation for taking the Exam Quiz. As soon as the assignment is completed, OWL gives you
the option to practice — a good idea if you struggled with particular questions or concepts.Exam Quizzes (40%)

There will be an Exam Quiz due each weekend — on Sundays at 11 pm. It will cover the same
material as that of the OWL HW assignment due at the same time (see schedule below). These
quizzes will be composed of 6 questions worth 1 point each, 14 questions worth 2 points each,
and 2 questions worth 3 points each — a total of 40 points for each EO. Students will get only one
attempt — and responses and scores will not be released until after the due date has passed. The
EQ will be available from 8 am on Saturdays to 11 pm on Sundays. These are timed and students
will have one hour from the time they begin — but students that start late on Sunday will NOT get
any time past 11 pm. There will be a total of 7 EQ’s and your lowest score will be dropped.
Practice exam quizzes will be provided in advance. Note: these are open-note exams — but if you
take the time to search in your book or notes for all the answers — you will NOT have time to finish.

Extra Credit

Students will have multiple opportunities to earn extra credit. There will be a couple of short
surveys you can complete for extra credit, but these points will primarily be based on your
performance on the OWL HW. Students that score 95% or higher on a HW assignment, will earn

1 extra credit point. All of the extra credit will be summed into an Extra Credit Total grade column
(| do this manually), which is included in the EQ grade category. By adding this total to a grade
category rather than an individual exam — you get the value of the extra credit, even if the EQ is
dropped. There is a maximum of 8 extra credit points.

Final Exam (20%)

There will be a cumulative final exam scheduled during the period of July 30-August 1. It will be
completed on Canvas and will be similar in format to that of the Exam Quizzes. One portion of
the exam will be identical in form to that of the other EO’s (same number of questions; 40 points)
and will relate to the material in Chapters 22 thru 24. The other portion of the final will relate to
the material in Chapters 1 thru 21. This portion will include 2 questions from each chapter, worth
2 points each (84 points). An abbreviated form of the Learning Objectives for this section of the
final will be provided. Students will have 3 hours to complete the final once they begin. It is
considered an open-note exam, as well.

Makeup Policy

According to UT policy, make-up exams may be given only if there is proper documentation of a
UT-sanctioned reason (serious illness, death in the family, but not planned vacations, weddings,
over-slept, etc). You will need to register your excuse with Student Emergency Services, who can
document your absence. Please email Dr. G to discuss.

How do I succeed in this course?
Use the Learning Objectives as your foundation for understanding the concepts.
Make use of class time!
Work as many problems as you can — from Squarecap, OWL HW, and the textbook Review
Exercises.
Digest as you go! Study a little each day.University Policies and Non-academic Resources

More information about each of the following subjects is available on the associated UT website.

Academic Integrity: Ethical conduct is expected at all times. Unethical conduct (cheating on exams, quizzes, etc)
may result in an automatic failing grade in the course and/or academic probation. If you have a question about
whether a particular activity is considered unethical, ASK FIRST. See the UT Academic Policy.

Administrative Deadlines: It is your responsibility to keep track of the deadlines for dropping the course, changing
to Pass/Fail, etc.

Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL), Counseling, and the Mental Health Center Crisis (MHCC) line: College
can be pretty stressful and sometimes we need a little help. Luckily, we have a wealth of resources and dedicated
people ready to assist you.

 

e If you are experiencing a mental health crisis (depression, anxiety, e.g.) call the MHCC
line at 512-471-CALL (2255). Call even if you aren't sure you're in a full- blown
crisis, but sincerely need help. Staff are there to help you.

e Alternatively, you can talk to Amy Trinh, our LPC (licensed professional
counselor) right here in CNS, by walking over to her office WC Hogg ™= 2.214,
or calling her at 512-471-7162. She usually has daily office hours for drop-

INS.

e If you have a behavioral concern about about someone else and need some advice on what to do, you may call
BCAL at 512-232-5050 to talk with someone about it. The call is confidential, and you decide how much
information you'd like to share.

e Of course, if you feel the behavior requires immediate attention, (e.g. person is of harm to self or you feel
threatened), call 911 directly.

General UT information: Recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety
and Security, 512-471-5767, htto://www.utexas.edu/safety/ . Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom
and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
building. Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at:

www.utexas.edu/emergency.

Personal or Family Emergencies: If you experience a personal or family emergency (death in the family, protracted
sickness, serious mental health issues) that prevents you from attending an exam or forces you to miss multiple days
of class, you should contact Student Emergency Services in the Office of the Dean of Students http://
deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/index.php . They will work with you to communicate with your professors

and let them know of your situation.

Religious Observances: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen (14) days
prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment,
or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work
within a reasonable time after the absence.

Students with Disabilities: All procedures outlined at http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/index.php will be

followed in this course. Please provide proper documentation from the SSD Office at the beginning of the semester.Schedule of Topics
