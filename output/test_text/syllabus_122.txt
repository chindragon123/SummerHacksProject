Research interest includes speech perception and production, and auditory perception of
speech and non-speech sounds for a variety of populations such as native and non-native
speakers, bilingual speakers, younger and older listeners, normal-hearing and hearing-
impaired listeners, listeners with musical deficits, and listeners with different language
backgrounds. Research area also covers speech enhancement and auditory training to
improve speech recognition in noise for different populations.
