Dr. Cuevas is responsible for lecture and evaluation of undergraduates and first-year graduate
students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. See Course Instruction list
above. Dr. Cuevas has sponsored projects and mentored students for their Senior Design
Project (EE464K) class. To date, Dr. Cuevas has taught 10 different undergraduate courses.

Hemo Touch, LLC. — 2006 to Present. Co-founder and Design Engineer.

HemoTouch was started in 2006 and incorporated in the State of Texas to develop a novel
medical device for monitoring neonatal conditions immediately after childbirth. A U.S. Patent
was applied for in 2006 and received in 2011 on this concept (US 7935061).

 

symmetrix/Symtx — 1994 to 1998. Technical and Management Advisor/Director of Engineering.
Dr. Cuevas provided technical and management direction for this high-technology start-up
engineering firm. While in this position, Dr. Cuevas grew the organization from six engineers to
40+ engineers while revenue grew from $700K to over $7M.

Tracor Aerospace, Tracor Applied Sciences, Tracor Flight Systems — 1983 to 1994. Engineer.
Dr. Cuevas provided technical direction for advanced material development used for

microwave signature control from 6GHz to 94GHz including passive decoy design for next-
generation low-observable platforms; passively modulated decoy systems; and microwave and
millimeter-wave camouflage design for high-valued land assets. Dr. Cuevas was the lead-
designer for the next-generation microwave active countermeasure expendable for the
Tri-service Programs. Dr. Cuevas provided detailed electronic warfare analyses using one-on-
one and many-on-many simulation codes. Dr. Cuevas developed multivariate clutter
classification algorithms to support active sonar clutter reduction techniques. Dr. Cuevas
provided technical direction for Tracor Flight Systems' radar hardware simulators, emitters, and
RF data recorders ($12M product line).

RECENT PROJECTS (DIARCY TECHNOLOGIES)

GPS Disciplined Frequency Standards — a low-cost (<$1K) frequency standard for metrology
usage. Provides multiple, simultaneous outputs from audio to 4000MHz while maintaining PPB
(parts per billion) accuracy. Design expertise used: RF circuit design, Low-noise analog
design, switching power supply design, FRGA/CPLD, mechanical design and packaging.
