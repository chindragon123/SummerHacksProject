Director of Robotics Education, Apptronik, Inc. Jan 2018-Jan 2019

Apptronik is a robotics startup building high power, high efficiency actuators and robotic
systems. My role is directing the development of a online education and training platform for
robotics under a SBIR Phase | grant. The vision for the platform is to provide Robotics-as-a-
Service (RaaS) for the education and training market, with the goal of eliminating infrastructure,
maintenance and safety costs for customers. Funded project:

“Cloud Based Shared Robotics Laboratory” — NSF-SBIR Phase | award, 2018 Pl, $225K, 2018VP Product Strategy, CoolChip Technologies, Nov 2014-Apr 2016

CoolChip Technologies was a VC backed start-up that is developing a technology called Kinetic
Cooling for high-performance thermal management. My role in the company was to develop
product strategy based on market needs and drive early customer traction through technology
evangelization and system analysis.

Co-founder and Chief Scientist, Nuventix, Inc.: 2005 to 2014, acquired by Aavid Thermalloy
Nuventix was a VC backed company that developed low power, high efficiency thermal
management systems for electronics using synthetic jets and was acquired by Aavid
Thermalloy. | was one of the principal researchers who adapted the Synjet technology for
thermal management at Georgia Tech and subsequently, one of the founders of the company.
| led the growth of Nuventix IP over last 8 years to over 80 patents and directed the Nuventix
technology strategy for diverse thermal management markets.

Research Engineer, Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Tech: 2001-2005
Post-Doctoral Fellow, Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Tech: 1999-2001
| developed the fundamental know-how for producing small-scale synthetic jets and studied
their interactions with heated surfaces. This research laid the groundwork for the formation of
Nuventix. With Prof. Ari Glezer, | pioneered the concept of using synthetic jet ejectors for
thermal management. As part of a DARPA funded program, we demonstrated the feasibility of
using small scale synthetic jets for highly efficient cooling using the inherent turbulence of the
synthetic jets and their ability to entrain mean flow.

Graduate Research Assistant, School of Aerospace Engineering, Georgia Tech: 1994-1999
For my doctoral research, | studied the development of axial flow in the core of the tip vortex
formed at the rotor blade and its effect when the vortex impinges on an airframe. This research
showed that the core axial velocity is nearly the same magnitude as the core circumferential
velocity and cannot be ignored in predictive models. Additionally, the behavior of the trailing
vortex when it hits a surface is dependent on the strength of the axial velocity component at
the time of impact.
