INTRODUCTION

Health care is an exciting and evolving field in which government policies play a vital role. The
course is designed for undergraduate students who seek an understanding of how to apply basic
microeconomic tools to the study of health and medical care issues. This course will examine the
special features of medical care as a commodity, the demand for health and medical care services,
the economic explanations for the behavior of medical care providers, the functioning of insurance
markets, federal health insurance programs, and regulation. Finally, this course will examine ideas
for health care reform. Empirical results, current issues, and policy applications will be discussed
throughout the course. JkoS A

Prerequisites: Intermediate Microeconomics (420K) is an essential prerequisite for this course.
If it’s been a while since you took intermediate microeconomics, the textbook provides a review in
Chapter 2. Chapter 3 reviews statistical tools for health economics.

COURSE MATERRIALS

Required Reading: The Economics of Health and Health Care, Folland, Goodman and Stano, 8"
Edition (Taylor & Francis, 2017)

Additional Reading: Additional required and optional readings from sources other than the
textbook will be posted on the course website (see below).

The course outline gives the chapters and articles that correspond to the lectures. For better
understanding of the course material the assigned reading must be finished before the class
recording.

Website: Course material will be on the university’s Canvas system. Lectures will be recorded
daily and posted on Lectures Online tab. All assignments will be posted on Canvas and discussed
in lecture recordings. This class will also use the Grades feature on Canvas so that students can
keep track of their scores on assignments and exams.

POLICY ON STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon receipt appropriate academic adjustments for

qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
Students—Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259.SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY POLICY

Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.

Writing Flag: This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give
students experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write
regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from
your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one
or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag
classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, and
Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

Writing Center: I strongly encourage you to use the Undergraduate Writing Center, FAC 211,
471-6222: http://www.uwc.utexas.edu/). The Undergraduate Writing Center offers free,
individualized, expert help with writing for any UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-
in basis. Any undergraduate enrolled in a course at UT can visit the UWC for assistance with any
writing project. The consultants there work with students from every department on campus, for
both academic and non-academic writing. Their services are not just for writing that has
"problems." Getting feedback from an informed audience is a normal part of a successful writing
project. This summer zoom consultations are available to all students.

EVALUATION AND GRADING

I. Writing Assignments. Note that the total for all writing assignments is 50% of your grade. The
course outline provides the relevant dates for all writing assignments. Each is due on the due date.
Lateness at any stage results in a loss of at least one letter grade on that assignment.

Research Paper. This course is a substantial writing component for undergraduates. Thus, a
significant paper is due at the end of the semester. For us to discuss how to do that research, you
will have to submit a first draft and final paper. You must choose a proposed or legislated health
care policy to write about. The paper must describe the policy and provide an economic analysis
that draws upon economic models discussed in class.

I would like you to start thinking early of a research topic. Feel free to talk to me about your topic,
your sources and approaches you can take in doing your research. Due dates along the way will
help guarantee progress.

There are several sources you could use to find a topic. One is simply to follow the policy debates
in the newspapers and magazines. Second is to look at the policies discussed in the class. A third
way is to browse through recent issues of economic policy journals, or the web pages of research
and policy institutions. I will be posting current articles on health economics topics on Canvas that
will guide you through the current health care issues.

The first draft should state the question you want to address, discuss the importance of your study
(i.e. why it is an important public policy issue) and it should include some literature review. It
should also develop a theoretical model. Illustrate your analysis with a graphical presentation ifappropriate. If your graphs are not incorporated into the text of your paper, please provide a clear
connection between graphs and text. You will upload your first draft on Canvas and comments
will be provided electronically. Each of you will then revise your first draft and submit final paper.

Short Paper. One assignment will count for 10% of your final grade. Short paper will be strictly
limited to 3 typed double-spaced pages in order to encourage succinct and incisive reasoning. Topic
will be announced in class.

II. Tests. There will be one midterm and a comprehensive final exam. If you have an emergency
that prevents you from taking an exam, I need to be notified by e-mail no later than the day of the
exam. There will be no make-up exams for the midterm. Should dire circumstances (e.g. illness)
prevent you from taking this test, its weight will be added to your final exam.

III. Problem Sets. Three problem sets will count towards your final grade. All assignments may
be obtained at the class web page. Collaboration among students in working out problem sets is
encouraged, but you must write up your own homework. Questions very similar to the problem
sets will appear on the exams. It behooves you to make sure that you understand and can present
the solutions to problems on your own in spite of working on the material with one another.
Turning in identical problem sets will result in a zero for both parties. Problem Sets will be
electronically uploaded on Canvas. Problem sets WILL NOT be accepted late. This is an absolute
policy. Please do not ask for extensions. Answer keys will be posted after the due date.
