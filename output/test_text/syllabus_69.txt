Mission Statement

 

The mission of BA 324 is to provide McCombs School of Business undergraduates with
a conceptual framework and specific tools for communicating in complex environments
and accomplishing strategic academic and professional business goals. This core course
provides writing, oral, and collaborative skills necessary for future business courses,
internships, and professional positions.

Course Objectives: Preparing Students for Business Environments

 

BA 324 focuses on writing, speaking, and interpersonal communication. Although
differences in instructors’ presentation styles are a natural and valuable part of a multi-
section course, all sections of BA 324 have the same objectives. These objectives specify
that business students, at the conclusion of the course, should be able to

#» Analyze communication situations and audiences to make choices about the most
effective and efficient way to communicate and deliver messages
=" Conduct research that includes the use of electronic library resources and the Internet;
use the results of that research to complete written and oral reports
1= Deliver effective business presentations in contexts that may require either
extemporaneous or impromptu oral presentations

# Provide feedback, accept feedback, and use feedback to improve communication
skills

» Write business documents that are grammatically correct and use appropriate business
style

" Develop effective interpersonal communication skills

#» Use communication technology appropriately and effectively

Core Communication Skills and Required Assignments

 

BA 324 focuses on a core set of communication skills and requires assignments that
support students in their learning of these skills. Students can expect to work on this core
set of skills in all sections of BA 324, although individual sections may add or substitute
specific assignments that teach the same skills and fulfill the same course objectives.
These communication skills and the types of assignments that teach those skills are
described below.

Written Communication: Students write letters, memos, proposals, formal and
informal reports, work plans, and progress reports.

Oral Communication: Oral presentations from 3-30 minutes in length address
informative, persuasive, and extemporaneous methods of delivery. Some oral
presentations require the use of visual aids such as handouts, overhead transparencies,
and presentation software such as PowerPoint.

Time Management: Assignments are varied, integrated, and overlapping, and students
must focus on multiple issues, projects, and demands. Students must, therefore, take
responsibility for planning and pacing their own work as well as developing time
management skills.

Project Development: Groups of approximately four to six students develop projects,
complete research, schedule meetings, write team papers and reports, and deliver a 20-30
minute oral presentation using visual aids. These projects build on and use the skills
developed in other class assignments.

Evaluation/feedback: Assignments that require students to learn and develop evaluation
and feedback skills are included throughout the course. These assignments may involve
editing one’s own writing and doing self-critiques, self-evaluations, or analyses of one’s
personal presentations, interpersonal communication, and other class activities. These
assignments may also involve peer-editing as well as providing evaluations and critiques
of the work of other class members.

Group Management: Students work on group projects to practice interpersonal skills by
communicating with group members, other groups, and peers outside the group.

Meeting Management: As part of the projects, groups meet on a regular basis, develop
meeting goals, make agendas, facilitate meetings, provide feedback, and submit meeting
summaries.Grading, Key Content Areas, and Required Assignments

 

Grades in BA 324 are based on a student’s work in three key content areas. These content
areas reflect the mission of the course, the course objectives, and the core communication
skills that students are expected to learn. Each of these content areas represents a fixed
percentage of the course’s content. In two of these areas, there 1s a minimum number of
specific assignments required for all sections of the course. Students should review the
required assignments for their particular BA 324 section.

Three key content areas for BA 324:

Written Communication (50%)
Including a minimum of
= Eight 1- to 3-page assignments or exercises (e.g., memos, emails, letters,
blogs, summaries, etc.).
= One business research report or proposal
=» Agendas, work plans, PowerPoint slides, outlines, etc.
Oral Communication (35 % )
Including a minimum of
= One group research presentation
= One interpersonal assignment
Professional Development (15% )
Including
=» Exams (essay or multiple choice), quizzes, and worksheets
# Online grammar and writing tutorials
# Class participation
= Professional conduct
= Other assignments (written or oral) requiring analysis and integration of
course concepts

BA 324: Writing Flag Designation (Substantial Writing Component Course)

 

Courses that carry a writing flag are intended to offer students significant opportunities to
hone their writing skills as they progress through their core curricula and major
coursework.

A writing flag course fulfills the following criteria:

e Requires students to write regularly—several times during the semester—and to
complete writing projects that are substantial. It is only through the practice of
writing that students learn to improve their writing.

e Is structured around the principle that good writing requires rewriting. Students
must receive meaningful feedback from the instructor (or teaching assistant) so
they can improve successive drafts.

e Includes writing assignments that constitute at least one-third of the final grade in
the course. These assignments must be graded on writing quality as well as
content.e Provides an opportunity for students to read each other’s work and offer
constructive criticism. Careful reading and analysis of the writing of others is a
valuable part of the learning process.

Written assignments comprise 50% of the grade for this course. Of that 50%, half of the

grade is based on the quality of your writing, and the other half is based on evidence of
your understanding of the material and fulfillment of other criteria.

Instructor Communications

 

Instructors use email and Canvas to communicate with students. Students are responsible
for checking their university-registered email accounts regularly. Emails from instructors
contain important information about the course.

Assignment Submission/Late Work Policy

 

If you fail to follow your instructor's submission instructions for an assignment (e.g.,
Canvas, TurnItIn, hard copy, etc.), your grade may be reduced according to the policy in
your instructor’s section syllabus.

Unless you receive instructions otherwise, written assignments are submitted on Canvas
and due by 8:00 am on the day the assignment is due. Late assignments are subject to a
20% point deduction. (Canvas time-stamps assignment submissions so that instructors can
see exactly when they were uploaded.) Late assignments will not be accepted after the
beginning of the next class meeting.

Grading Policy for All BA 324 Sections

 

The following plus/minus scale will be used to determine final course grades in all
BA 324 sections:

A 940 and above B- 800-839.9 D+ 680-699.9
A- 900-939.9 C+ 780-799.9 D 640-679.9
B+ 880-899.9 C 740-779.9 D- 600-639.9
B_ 840-879.9 C- 700-739.9 F 5399 and below

Due to the accelerated nature of summer classes, should assignments not total 1000
points, your grade is calculated as a percentage. For instance, 875 earned points out of a
total possible points of 935 (875/935) is 93%--thus earning an A-.

University Policies Relevant to BA 324 Students

 

Academic Integrity (Please read very carefully)
The responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are
described in detail in the Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty for the McCombsSchool of Business, available online at
http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/udean/Scholastic_Responsibility.asp

One provisions of this statement reads as follows:

“The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of
scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both students and
faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in
detail in the Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty for the
McCombs School of Business. By teaching this course, I have
agreed to observe all of the faculty responsibilities described in
that document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to
observe all of the student responsibilities described in that
document. If the application of that Policy Statement to this
class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your
responsibility to ask me for clarification. Policy on Scholastic
Dishonesty: Students who violate University rules on scholastic
dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students,
and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic
dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to the
Student Judicial Services website
(http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/) or the General
Information Catalog to access the official University policies
and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further
elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.”

BA 324 instructors will follow and enforce the provisions of the Policy Statement on
Scholastic Dishonesty for the McCombs School of Business. You are responsible for
reading, understanding and following the Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty for
the McCombs School of Business and the policies and procedures on scholastic
dishonesty on the Student Judicial Services website. Included in these responsibilities is
the responsibility for understanding what actions constitute scholastic dishonesty.

You may not use any resources, including, but not limited to books, computers,
databases, etc. for out-of-class assignments if using such resources constitutes one or
more acts of scholastic dishonesty, as defined in the General Information Catalog or as
described in the Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty for the McCombs School of
Business. By way of example and not by limitation, you may not consult or submit work
(in whole or in part) that has been completed by other students in this or previous years
for the same or substantially the same assignment.

Students should be aware that all required writing assignments may be submitted through
a software program called TurnItIn on Canvas. The software is designed to help faculty
and students organize and improve the writing process by encouraging original
submissions and proper citation practices.Class Websites and Student Privacy

Instructions for Dr. Pryor’s Classes

Business Communication: Oral and Written

Business professionals spend approximately seventy percent (70%) of their time communicating.
Thus, good communication skills are essential to you in your career, and they are a primary criteria
of employers in both hiring and promotion decisions. This course is designed in response to
industry feedback about the communication skills needed for business graduates to enter
successfully into today's competitive marketplace. This course is very practical. It will, however,
require effort on your part. It will also require regular attendance; because significant class time is
spent working in groups applying principles and strategies discussed in your book and in class.
You improve your communication skills by working together and by giving and getting
constructive feedback.

This course is not difficult, but it is demanding just like the office/work/corporate environment
you will enter in a few months or years!

Attendance:
Reliable and punctual attendance is critical and expected.

GENERAL CLASSROOM POLICIES AND PROFESSOR QUIRKS

In an effort to create a classroom environment conducive to learning, the following is expected and
enforced.

1. Assignments are due no later than 8:00AM on the day they are due. Upon occasion, the due
date and time will be altered. Late assignments receive a 20% deduction. Late assignments
will only be accepted until 8:00 am on the day of the next class period. Unless instructed
differently, submit assignments via CANVAS in PDF form.

2. Should you miss a class, it is your responsibly to learn what you missed, but don’t expect
the professor or grader to bring you up to date. This is one of the reasons you develop
helpful relationships with your colleagues.

3. If you have a question regarding a grade, you first inquiry is with your grader.10

4. When discussing a grade with your grader or professor, an attitude of understanding will
serve you well. Arguing regarding a grade will not serve you well. Consider aggressive or
uncivil behavior with a grader or professor unprofessional.

5. When you would like clarification regarding a grade, you should inquire within seven days.
After seven days, the grade or assignment is not discussed or adjusted.

6. MindTap Grammar Quizzes. There are ten quizzes, each to be completed by the time and
day listed in the Class Schedule and Assignment section of this document. You get three
tries on each quiz. To receive credit for each quiz, you much score at least 90% on at least
one of the three tries. If you earn 90%, you receive five (5) points. If you do not earn 90%
on an individual quiz, you receive no points. There is no partial credit.

7. Assignments cannot be reworked. Extra work to improve a grade is not a possibility.
Grades are not rounded. For instance, 89.9 is a B+, not an A-.

9. Individual assignments or final grades are not negotiable. “The internship I want requires a
3.5 GPA”, “My parents will kill me’, “I’ve never made a B”, “But I tried really hard”’, etc.
are not reasons for grade adjustments.

10. The most successful students taking this class do an outstanding job of working with their
colleagues. Individuals who approach the class as an individual contributor (non-team-
player), do not fare as well.

11. Humor and creativity is appreciated and encouraged.

12. The word on the street regarding my class is that I don’t provide as much detail regarding
assignments as you might like or are accustomed to receiving. If you have questions or
need more detail, ask!

13. This is a communication class, which means all types of communication are valued. If you
do not verbally participate in class—provide feedback, express opinions, ask questions and
make suggestions; you will not do well.

14. A word regarding how assignments are viewed and evaluated: The criteria is how effective
it would be perceived in the corporate environment.

15. One more thing. Any speech that begins with “My name is ” or “My speech is about
” or “Today Ia going to talk about ” will immediately lose one letter grade.

GRADE QUESTIONS - ASSIGNMENTS

You are welcome to raise questions about potential data entry or calculation errors. If you do not
understand the reason you received a specific grade on an assignment, please visit me or your
grader during office hours or arrange an appointment. Please wait 24 hours after receiving your
grade, but no more than one week (seven days) to discuss your questions with your grader or me.
A tone of inquiry (e.g. “help me understand....’’) is the most successful approach. While I am
happy to listen to your viewpoint or perception of an assignment or exam question, do not expect
this to change your grade since a major course objective is for you to learn how to understand and
respond to other's viewpoints.11

GRADE QUESTIONS — COURSE

The final grade assigned in the course is an informed and final evaluation and is not open for
discussion or negotiation. Any lobbying efforts (e.g., asking for a higher grade because you want
one, need one, etc.) does not demonstrate an audience-centered approach to communication and
will not be successful. No additional assignments or extra credit are offered to individual students.
To make your desired grade in this course, you must produce work that is high quality and
technically clean to earn the points tied to the grade-level standards indicated above. Please note
that grades reflect your outputs and outcomes, not effort or improvement. The ultimate criteria is
how well your work might be received in a corporate environment.

COURSE GOALS

This course is designed to help you:

¢ Develop basic communication skills you need to write, make oral presentations, communicate
interpersonally, and work effectively in groups.

¢ Value the differences between yourself and others and to employ that understanding to

improve the quality of your communication.

Recognize and value the diverse contributions of all members of an organization.

Improve your communication in future courses and in your career.

Refine the process of written and oral communication in business.

Use methods of problem solving in business communication that can be used as an individual

or as a group.

¢ Develop basic reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills in addition to the ability to follow
complete, complex written and oral instructions.

BUSINESS WRITING CRITERIA

Clarity, Concreteness, and Conciseness:
e Clarity - write so that your concepts, organization, paragraphs, and sentences are clearly
understandable to your audience
e Concreteness - write specifically for your audience in a way that includes examples to
support your ideas
e Conciseness - write simply and directly, unless you have a specific purpose for doing
otherwise

Organization
e Organize letters, memos, and reports around the main ideas as detailed in the assignment
objectives
e Lay out main ideas clearly and support them with specific examples
e Connect all parts of your writing with logical, smooth, and understandable transitions

e Use a business style that is related to the level of formality of the communication
e Base your style on the audience to whom you are writing12

e Choose a format that is appropriate to your audience, the purposes of your communication,
and your organizational context

e Remember that you can receive excellent assistance at the UT Learning Center in Jester
and the Undergraduate Writing Center in the FAC. Your written assignments are detailed
on an assignment sheet in this syllabus. Specific topics for assignments are made as each
is discussed in class.

WRITING ASSIGNMENT GRADING GUIDELINES

Each of the following mistakes will be counted off one (1) point the first time it 1s made on an
assignment. Each additional mistake of the same specific assignment will not be counted off.
Depending upon the severity of the grammar or formatting mistake, additional points will also be
deducted.

e Grammar mistakes

e Formatting mistakes

e Incorrect graphic highlighting

e Unprofessional tone

e Use of contractions

e Over use of business clichés such as “do not hesitate to” or “feel free to”

e Wordiness

e Redundancy or repetition

e Widows/orphans
© Bullets should only be used to list at least two items (do not use a single bullet)
o Single words should not be left on their own line

e Spelling mistakes, typos or factual errors

e Unnecessary repetition

e Poorly written or confusing narrative. *See clarity and readability below

Generally speaking, “less is more” when writing in the business environment. Shorter sentences
are better. In most cases, two short sentences is better than one long, complex sentence.

*Clarity and readability are also essential issues. Unfortunately, clarity and readability are
subjective, and not easily measured. A hint—read your assignment aloud. It is a good way to
insure clarity and readability. Effective graphics and the use of white space is important.

While there are generally accepted standards regarding writing, there is also a degree of
subjectivity—including how your grader evaluates your written work. Part of your challenge is to
work with your grader to determine how best to target your work for the reader (in your case, the
grader). In the future you will need to do this in regard to your superior, colleagues and clients.

One more thought regarding your writing assignments. The goal is not first and foremost to
complete the assignment. The goal is to communicate effectively.13

Scholastic Dishonesty

Scholastic dishonesty as defined by university standards will not be tolerated. Students found to
engage in scholastic dishonesty, including plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration, will be
referred to the Office of the Dean of Students for disciplinary action. An 'F' in the course will be
the recommended penalty in most cases of scholastic dishonesty.
