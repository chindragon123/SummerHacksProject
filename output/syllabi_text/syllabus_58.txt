Course Description: This course is an introduction to the principles and methods of biological
anthropology. Biological (sometimes called “physical’’) anthropology is a field which
incorporates the study of human beings in their biological context and seeks to explain our
relationship with other primates and to the rest of the natural world. This field explores questions
like: What are we? How are we unique? How and why did we come to be the way we are given
the natural world around us?

The study of biological anthropology is inherently interdisciplinary. Throughout the
course, we will examine anatomical, behavioral, and genetic similarities and differences among
living primates, learn the basic mechanisms of the evolutionary process, and trace the pathway of
human evolution as reconstructed from the fossil record. The main goal of the course is to see
humans and primates, broadly, as being in a natural world.

Lab exercises and assignments will be incorporated into class time and will be taught by
the teaching assistant. These labs complement the lecture and enhance your experience with the
subject material by conceptualizing the matter from a different perspective. You will have the
opportunity to examine “hands-on”, human and non-human skeletal material, as well as
participate in discussions.Laboratory Component: There is no separate lab section for this course. Labs will be
incorporated into regular class time. See the lecture/lab schedule for more information.

Prerequisites: None.

Course learning objectives:
e Understand the broader role of nonhuman primates in forest ecosystems
e Understand the basics of primate and human evolutionary history
e Understand the basics of human variation

COURSE REQUIREMENTS

Required materials: Boyd & Silk. How humans evolved, 7th edition (or earlier).

I am purposefully not assigning the most recent edition of this textbook to keep cost down. If you
buy an earlier edition, make sure to not rely on 1t when it comes to fossil hominin information as
these sections are updated with each edition, rather use my lectures for this information. Please
support local bookstores and buy used books if possible.

Required devices: Computer with internet, Canvas, and Zoom access and abilities. You must
sign in to Zoom using the UTexas domain to have access to the class Zoom meetings.

Classroom expectations: I expect you to come to the Zoom lectures at our scheduled class time.
Recorded lectures are for students who cannot attend a regularly scheduled lecture. You must
contact me to let me know the reason that you do not attend lecture. Recorded lectures will be
posted for students to use when studying for quizzes.

Assignments: You are responsible for taking quizzes on Canvas before or by their due date,
attending lab and completing lab assignments, participating in weekly discussion posts, and
submitting the final report.

Quizzes (50% of your course grade)
Canvas quizzes will be assigned periodically throughout the course and functionally replace
exams, ensuring that students are keeping up with learning material as it is taught.
- 8 quizzes total, however the lowest grade is dropped
- Approximately 15 multiple choice questions
- 15 minutes to complete the quizzes
o Your 15 minutes begins when you open the quiz on Canvas
o Youcannot leave the and come back to it at a different time
o One attempt per quiz
- All quizzes are open book, open note, and open lecture, but are not to be taken
collaboratively
- Quizzes are due at 11:59pm (CST) on their due date (listed below in the schedule)

 

Labs (25% of your course grade)

The Lab component of this course serves to help you apply what you are learning in class to
biological data (1.e. skeletal models or simulations) and make inferences about processes or
patterns based on your observations.- 5 lab meetings throughout the course

- Take place over Zoom at our regularly scheduled class time

- Attend the Zoom lab lecture, participate in discussion, and complete the lab assignment
using online materials provided

- The TA will break the class into lab groups to work collaboratively on the assignments

- Lab exercises are due at 11:59pm (CST) on their due date (listed below in the schedule)

Discussion posts (10% of your course grade)

Discussion prompts will be posted on canvas and are meant to keep you engaged in the course
material and facilitate interaction and collaboration with your classmates.
- Each week (Monday morning) a new discussion topic will be posted on Canvas
- Submit a short comment/contribution (100 to 200 words) to the discussion once per topic
before the deadline, after which the discussion post closes. Don’t be late!
- Due by 11:59pm (CST) each Friday

Final report (15% of your course grade)
You must find an example of biological anthropology in the news, media, or in popular culture
and analyze it in the context of what we have discussed in this course.

- To get full credit you must address: 1) which biological anthropology frameworks are
represented and 2) how accurately/inaccurately they are being portrayed based on what
you learned in the class

- Examples of this would be finding news coverage of behavior of monkeys that live
around the Taj Mahal, eugenics in the news, a popular media description of a hominin
discovery, a movie or book you have read (1.e., Planet of the Apes), etc.

© Feel free to email the instructor or your TA with questions or ideas about topics
- Write and submit a 3-page paper (double spaced, 12-point font)
- Due on Canvas by 5pm (CST) on the last day of class (July 9")

 

Grading: Grades are based on the following, and letter grades will be assigned using the +/-
grading system. (UT does not offer A+). Grades are rounded up on if 0.5 or above.

A (93 to 100), A- (90 to <93), B+ (87 to <90), B (83 to <87), B- (80 to <83), C+ (77 to <80), C

COURSE POLICIES

Although we will have a digital Zoom classroom, we expect you to uphold the same policies as
you would in an in-person classroom. The following policies provide clear guidelines on issues
that students may face throughout the course. Please read all the information carefully.

Make-ups: There will be no make-up quizzes or labs. Exceptions will be made only 1) with
proof of emergency or illness, 2) due to observance of a religious holiday, or 3) due to military

service.

Illness or emergency: If you miss an exam or lab due to illness or emergency, contact the
instructor or TA as soon as possible. You will not be given a make-up unless you can providedocumentation regarding the reason for your absence. We are ready and willing to make
accommodations — just contact us!

Important note regarding summer courses: Summer is often a busy time on your social
calendar, but you have committed to take a course that meets every day for just over a month.
We will cover material rapidly and will test you on it (via quizzes) frequently, and if you miss
classes, your grade will likely suffer. We will not provide alternative quizzes or labs for students
who have personal travel/vacation plans or commitments (e.g. weddings, family reunions, etc.),
however unlikely those are this summer.

Late assignments: Late lab assignments will cost you 10 percentage points per day. This could
change your grade dramatically so ensure you turn your labs in by the deadline.

Religious holidays: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least
fourteen (14) days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a
class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day,
you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the
absence.

Absence for military service: In accordance with section 51.9111 of the Texas Education Code,
a student is excused from attending classes or engaging in other required activities, including
exams, if he or she is called to active military service of a reasonably brief duration. [The
maximum time for which the student may be excused has been defined by the Texas Higher
Education Coordinating Board as "no more than 25 percent of the total number of class meetings
or the contact hour equivalent (not including the final examination period) for the specific course
or courses in which the student is currently enrolled at the beginning of the period of active
military service.” | The student will be allowed a reasonable time after the absence to complete
assignments and take exams.

Students with disabilities: Any student with a documented disability who requires academic
accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities
(http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/), at ssd@austin.utexas.edu, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 512-
410-6644 (Video Phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized
accommodations. Please inform me as soon as possible if you need accommodations.

Attendance: Although this is not an in-person class, you are expected to be present in the Zoom
classroom each day and keep up with all the course content. This applies to the content of the
class, handouts, and announcements about class policies, events, deadlines, etc. It is easy to miss
pertinent information if you are absent from class. There may be students who are dealing with
family or personal health emergencies during this unusual summer and this course is designed to
be accessible even to those who have to miss class for extraordinary circumstances. If you are
not one of these students, you are expected in class each day.

Grades: The grade you are given, is your grade unless an error has been made. If you think an
error has been made, let me know within one week of receiving the assignment or quiz grade.Extra credit: I do not offer “extra credit” opportunities. If you are struggling in the course,
please come for help during the semester when there is still time for me to help you. Make an
appointment with me as soon as possible. Do not wait until the course is over and ask me to
change your grade because you are trying to graduate, or you have had a tough time with your
personal life this semester. By then, it is too late for me to help you.

Honor Code: Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor
Code.: The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.

Scholastic Dishonesty Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are
subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal
from The University. Scholastic dishonesty" includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism,
collusion, falsifying academic records, misrepresenting facts, and any act designed to give unfair
academic advantage to the student (such as, but not limited to, submission of essentially the same
written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor), or the attempt
to commit such an act.

Also, see http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis.php

Special note on use of social media: If students create any social media group to communicate

about the course, the instructor and teaching assistant must be provided access. Communication

about content/answers to lab homework, assignments, or course quizzes (whether verbally or via
electronic communications) will be considered cheating and students involved will be subject to
disciplinary action.
