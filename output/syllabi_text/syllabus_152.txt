COURSE DESCRIPTION

Operations Management (OM), best viewed as process management, involves the systematic planning,
design, operation, control, and improvement of businesses processes. Managing operations is vital to
every organization, for it is only through the effective and efficient performance of work to be done that
an organization can be successful in the long run. This is certainly true today when we see that
significant competitive advantages accrue to those firms that manage their operations well, as
exemplified by Southwest, Exxon, Amazon, Wal-Mart, Toyota, and so forth.

The course is conceptually structured in three interweaving modules. In one, we introduce the basic
vocabulary of OM. We consider process analysis, process design, and process control in the context of
both manufacturing and service operations. In another, we look at several critical OM issues: inventory
management, project management, supply chain management, and management of waiting lines.
Finally, in another, we seek ways to improve the overall competitiveness of a firm by exploring some
strategic aspects of OM like lean operations (Toyota) and focused operations (Southwest).

COURSE PREREQUISITES

Credit or registration for Business Administration 324 or 324H and credit or registration for Statistics
309 or 309H.

COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES
At the end of this course, you should have gained an improved understanding of:

how every organization uses processes to transform inputs into goods and services
the importance of careful design, operation, and improvement of business processes

and acquired the skills to

analyze any manufacturing or service process to uncover improvement opportunities

TEACHI EARNING METHODOLOGY

This course is a mixture of lectures, case discussions and problem solving. In class, have a calculator
ready to help with arithmetic. The readings for the class consist of a readings packet (which has all
the cases) denoted by RP in the detailed course outline and available from Harvard Business
School Publishing (https://hbsp.harvard. import/728537), and one required book (described
below) available from the University Coop:

Matching Supply with Demand (Fourth Edition, McGraw-Hill) by Cachon and Terwiesch. (This is as
close to a textbook as we have in this course. We shall use this book largely as a reference. Please read
the assigned sections of this text, denoted by C&T in the detailed course outline, somewhat lightly at
first. Go back for a re-read as you deem useful after we discuss the topic in class.A packet of overheads (slides) is available on Canvas (Modules/Class Slides). You must have the
appropriate overheads for each class starting with Session 1 (Thursday, June 4). You may want to
print hard copies of the slides for use during class.

CLASS PREPARATION In preparing for each class session, you must complete the mandatory
readings before class. Suggested questions to help you prepare for case discussions are provided
in the syllabus. You must have the case/exercise listed for that session handy for ready
consultation. Doing these two things constitutes your credentials as a class participant. Neglect

one and you are but a mere spectator in class. Learning Operations is not a spectator sport.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to make this class better for you.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

The final grade in this class will be based on your demonstrated performance as follows:

Attendance

Midterm Exam (Thursday, June 25: 12:00-2:15 PM)

Final Exam: During July 10-11, time to be confirmed by the Registrar’s Office.

 

For every class session you attend in full, up to a maximum of twenty sessions out of twenty-one
sessions this term, you will earn for attendance.

  
  

 

In other words,
attendance and final exam together will account for 70% of your course grade. In addition, I shall assign
a bonus amounting to up to 5% of course grade. The bonus will depend solely on my very subjective
evaluation of your class contribution — a measure of how actively you are engaged in class, your
preparedness for class, and your contribution to the learning of others.

Plus and minus grades will be used for the final class grade. The BBA Program recommended grade
point average for this course is 3.2-3.4.

Exams Exams will be administered via Canvas. It is recommended that both exams be closed-book and
closed-notes. However, you may bring a self-prepared 3”x5” two-sided notes card to each exam.

Homework: Individual and Gr Practice Problems, an lutions (Available on Canvas) The

Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty

The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail
in the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at

-of-Ethics. By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe
all faculty responsibilities described there. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all
student responsibilities described there. If the application of the Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to
this class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty
harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the University, and the value of our academic brand,
policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to the Student Conduct
and Academic Integrity website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/ to access the official

at least 314 (353 minus 39 in Groups 2 and 3 in Exhibit 6) are between the end of the paint line and the
first seat installation station. What is the corresponding flow time? After subtracting the time a

seat spends: traveling on TMM’s overhead seat conveyor line (about 250 meters), traveling in the truck,
and waiting on KFS’s staging line, you get the time KFS has to assemble a seat. What is the time?

4. What is the cost of stopping the line for one cycle? For five minutes? For half-an-hour?

5. What can Doug do to address the seat quality problem?
