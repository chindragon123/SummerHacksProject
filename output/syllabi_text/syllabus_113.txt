physics. See below for the course schedule.

Communications

It is your responsibility to stay on top of the developments in the course as they occur.
You should customize your Canvas preferences to receive immediate notifications of due
dates, messages, and announcements through email, text, or the Canvas App on your
smartphone. Otherwise, you are required to log into the course and check assignments,
announcements, and Inbox regularly and frequently.

Piazza Q&A

We will be using Piazza for class discussions, which can be accessed from the left
navigation menu in Canvas. If you have questions about anything related to lectures,
homework, or course logistics, please post them on Piazza rather than emailing the TAs
or me. You can even post your questions anonymously. The system is geared toward
students interacting with and helping each other. Not only answering other students’questions allows everyone to get help quickly and efficiently but explaining to someone
else is the best way to check and improve your understanding of the material as well.
The TAs and I can revise (if necessary) and endorse student answers so you can be
confident in the quality of the responses.

Course Pre- and Co-Requisites
High school trigonometry or Mathematics 305G. Credit or concurrent registration for
Physics 102M, which is a distinct and separately graded course.

Administrative Issues
Please contact Ms. Melva Harbin, mharbin@austin.utexas.edu.

Grading

Your course average will be calculated based on the weighted sum of the following:
Homework — 23%, Pre-class Reading Quizzes — 5%, Exams — 72%. Course letter grades
will be determined by a class curve at the end of the term and no prescribed cutoff values
should be assumed.

Pre-Class Reading and Class Meetings

We will be holding synchronous class meetings on Zoom. The class meetings will be
recorded. If you miss a class on any given day, you can review the lecture video which
will be posted on Canvas a few hours after each class. Prior to each class meeting, you
are expected to have read the relevant material from the textbook for that day and
complete a reading quiz on Canvas. The lectures will not simply regurgitate what you
have read, rather they will focus on explaining and expanding the concepts that you may
have difficulty understanding and helping you develop quantitative problem-solving
skills. During each class, interactive quiz questions will be given to highlight the
concepts. From time to time, you will be asked to answer some of these questions using
the free UT Instapoll app within Canvas.

TA Discussion Sessions and Extra Credit

The TA discussion sessions are an integral part of the course. Up to 3% extra credit will
be given for active participation in these sessions. Note that any extra credit will be
applied after the grade cutoffs have been established at the end of the semester. In this
way, eligible students will benefit from it without penalizing other students.

Homework Assignments

Homework will be administered by the Quest homework server

(https: //quest.cns.utexas.edu) maintained by the College of Natural Sciences. You will
download the assignments and submit your answers on the web and the solutions will
be available right after the due time. Read the students’ documentation at

https: //wikis.utexas.edu/display/questla/Students. Pay particular attention to how to
enter numbers in scientific notation

(https: //wikis.utexas.edu/display/questla/Numberst+and+ScientifictNotation) and how
grading works (https: //wikis.utexas.edu/display/questla/Zero+Floor+Default). The
lowest two homework scores will be dropped. You are encouraged to work together on the
homework. You must, however, submit your own work for credit. Quest service requires
you to pay a $30 charge per course and $60 for two or more courses per semester for its
use. This charge goes toward the maintenance and operation of the resource. For

payment questions, email quest.billing@cns.utexas.edu.Midterm Exams and Final Exam

There will be three midterm exams during class time on Tuesday June 16, Friday June
26, and Wednesday July 08. The final exam is comprehensive and cumulative and will be
held from 7 to 9 pm on Friday July 10. The lowest exam score will be dropped. There will
be no make-up exams. If you miss an exam for any reason, it will be the one that will be
dropped. If you take all three midterm exams and are content with your grades, you can
opt out of the final exam. All exams will be open physical notes but NOT open internet.
You may not access any electronic documents or online resources or search for answers
to specific questions on the internet during an exam. No electronic devices except the
computer you use to take the exam and a calculator will be allowed. In addition, you may
not communicate with anyone about any aspect of the exam in any way during an exam,
except with Proctorio Support. Any work that you submit must be entirely your own.

Proctorio

The exams will be proctored using Proctorio, a remote proctoring tool. You will

be required to show your UT ID or a government-issued ID before beginning an exam.
You must use a desktop or laptop computer with a webcam and a microphone and a
stable internet connection. It is your responsibility to make sure that your computer
meets the minimum system requirements for Proctorio. During an exam, Proctorio will
record your testing environment. Therefore, you should select private spaces for the
exam session where disruptions are unlikely and where recording devices can be
enabled. You must ensure that any recordings do not invade any third-party privacy
rights and accept all responsibility and liability for violations of any third-party privacy
concerns. For additional information, you can visit the Proctorio website

(https: roctorio.com/support). Instructions on how to set up Proctorio and how to take
a proctored exam can be found at

https: / /utexas.instructure.com/courses /633028 /pages/student-tutorials#fragment-3
and https://cdn.proctorio.com/guides/canvas/test-taker/getting-started.pdf.

Please note that enrollment in the course is an agreement to abide by and accept all
terms. If you do not agree to the proctoring requirements, you may elect to drop this
course before the end of the drop/add period.

Academic dishonesty

The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each student is expected to
uphold the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The University of Texas at
Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.”
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failing the course and/or suspension/dismissal
from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the
integrity of the University, policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For
further information, please visit the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at:

http: //deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct.

Special Accommodations

This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If
there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult,
please let me know. Any student with a documented disability who requires academicaccommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities

(https: / /diversity.utexas.edu/disability/) as soon as possible to request an official letter
outlining authorized accommodations. Any student facing severe difficulties or
emergency during the session should contact the Student Emergency Services

(https: //deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency), which helps to coordinate between the
student and the instructors.
