Course Description:

This course consists of a philosophical consideration of the relation between medicine and society with a
focus on values. It has five broad themes: (1) It begins with a brief look at how science and values interact
in the practice of medicine. (2) Next it takes a look at what science tells us about human bodies, when they
are alive and when they are not, when, if alive, they are human and when they are not. These questions
are relevant to many traditional issues in biomedical ethics, including abortion and euthanasia, though the
scope of this course is much broader. (3) It then turns to the Human Genome Project and postgenomics
and their implications for medicine. It questions the goals and achievements of the Human Genome Project
but engages with how it may have enabled a new biomedical future by fostering a new eugenics. It deals
with the troublesome legacy of eugenics in the past and analyzes the extent to which those problems can be
adequately addressed. (4) In this context, the course turns to the advent of CRISPR technology and what it
means both for the elimination of genetic diseases and prospects for designer babies. (5) Finally, the course
turns to issues of public health, with a focus on the theory of vaccination as well as vaccine hesitancy, but
with an eye towards addressing general questions of the social control of individual choice, as for instance
exemplified most extremely in the current public health response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Prerequisites: None, but students are expected to be willing to satisfy ambitious reading requirements and
to participate meaningfully in class discussions and other course-related activities.

Course Organization:

Because of UT’s response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, this course will be taught entirely online but
with the expectation that students have course-related activities every working day of the week. On Mondays,
the Instructor will deliver a synchronous lecture over UT Zoom that sets the agenda for the week and summa-
rizes the online lectures and explicates the week’s academic goals. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, on their own
time, students will be expected to absorb up to three online lectures on their own time. Each lecture will have
associated with it a set of readings that are critical for participation in the course. The lecture will consist of
a detailed outline and, with two exceptions, an audio component consisting of the Instructor lecturing on the
topic. The audio component will go beyond the readings and, on some occasions, beyond the outline. ‘They
are also central to the course. These materials will be made available through multiple sources including
a dedicated web-site (https: //sahotra-sarkar.org/medicine-ethics-and-society-lectures-2020/)
and Canvas. Students are expected to have completed these lectures before class time on Thursday when
the Teaching Assistant will conduct a synchronous review/discussion session over UT Zoom. On Fridays,
students will be expected to complete an online Canvas-based assessment of the work of the week. While
they can choose when to engage in this assessment, the time taken to complete it, once begun, will be limited
to 75 minutes. These assessments will be the basis for the course grade.

to complete the assignment. Grades will not be curved. Passing grades will consist of: 60 -62, D-; 63
