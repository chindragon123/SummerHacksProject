Course Description

In this class we will take a critical look at some of the topical issues within the general field of
autism and developmental disabilities. Of course, there are many controversial issues that are
current with this group. For example, there are a variety of treatments that are being touted in the
popular media for individuals with autism. However, there are no data to support the
effectiveness of many such treatments. We need not delve in to the popular media to find
controversy. There is quite a degree of divisiveness within the professional fields with regard to
best practices in education, treatment, and lifestyle supports for these people. In this class I will
facilitate discussion of a select number of these trends and issues.

Course Structure
The class will be a combined synchronous/asynchronous format as some activities will occur
fully on canvas via the message board-(discussions) and others via live zoom class meetings.

Readings: You are required to purchase a core text. The text is available at the
University Co-Op website and other popular online sources (e.g., amazon.com). Other readings
are available electronically via Canvas. I will also make readings available in class as needed.

Assignments
Discussion Questions & Responses:
You will submit a set of three discussion questions/topics for each topic. Questions will be
posted by 9 AM each morning (Monday-Thursday) for that day’s topic. These questions will be
geared to stimulate discussion for the class. Your questions/topics should stem from the readings
for that session. Questions need to be uploaded to Canvas-based discussion board. Under each
question you will write a brief paragraph (2-5 sentences) outlining your rationale for each
question (e.g., why you think this question is important to discuss). We will interact with
discussion questions in two different ways and will depend on the topic/session:

Online discussion-based sessions. You will be required to respond to at least two other questionsposed by classmates. Responses must be posted by the subsequent Sunday (of the week in which
the initial questions were due). Thus, Canvas discussion board-based discussions will be on-

going.

Zoom-based sessions. You will NOT be required to respond to classmate questions via the
Canvas discussion board (but will not be restricted). Questions and rationales will be discussed
as a group during zoom-based sessions. Questions and rationales will be discussed during the
zoom-based sessions.

Topic Presentations/Class Leadership:

As we advance through the term the class as a group will discuss and additional trends and issues
other than those covered in the curriculum. Students will select 1 of these topics for their
presentation and will present and lead the class in a discussion of this topic for approximately 30
minutes.

Grading Structure:
Grades will be calculated in the following manner:

Submitted discussion questions (1.1 per; 3.3 per module): 30%
Oral and online discussion questions/comments (1.65 per; 3.3 per module): 30%
Topic presentation class leadership (40 per): 40%
Total Points 100 points

Grades

Grades will be assigned in the following manner

A = 95-100 points C = 74-76 points

A- = 90-94 points C- = 70-73 points

B+ = 87-89 points D+ = 67-69 points

B = 84-86 points D = 64-66 points

B- = 80-83 points D- = 60-63 points

C+ = 77-79 points F =< 60 points

Class attendance and participation:

Attendance at class is mandatory. If you wish to be absent for the observance of a religious holy
day, please give notification to me at least 5 days prior to your absence or please inform me the
first class day for religious holy days that fall within the first two weeks of the semester.

Important Dates for Summer Semester 2020:
Please see the following website for a complete list of important dates in The University of

Evaluation of the Course and Instructor:
It is the policy of the College of Education that all organized courses will be evaluated using an
appropriate Course Instructor Survey arranged through the Measurement and Evaluation Center.Consequently, you will be given the opportunity to complete a Student course evaluation in the
last week of the course. Student evaluations remain anonymous. Neither the instructor nor the
teaching assistant is to be present during the evaluation and neither is to see the answer sheets
until grades have been officially reported. Students have requested that they be given the
opportunity to complete the Course Instructor Survey at the beginning of the class period to
increase the likelihood that all students will participate in the evaluation process.

Students with Special Needs:

At the beginning of the semester, students with disabilities who need special accommodations
should notify the instructor by presenting a letter prepared by the Services for Students with
Disabilities (SSD) Office. To ensure that the most Appropriate accommodations can be provided,
students should contact the SSD Office at 471-6259 or 471-4641.

Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty:
Students who violate university rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary

penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity
