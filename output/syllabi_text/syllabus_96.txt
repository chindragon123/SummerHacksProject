E f316M: American Literature

Summer 2020

Unique #79740

Professor Evan Carton & Professor Coleman Hutchison

Course Description
This team-taught, self-paced course in the American literary tradition will explore historical and

thematic connections between writers and works from the 17*" to the 21°t centuries. In doing
so, the course will also provide a variety of opportunities for students to increase their
enjoyment of and engagement with literature, as well as their skills as analytical readers and
writers. After an introductory unit in which students will be introduced to some key terms and
methods for reading literature more skillfully and enjoyably, the course will be organized
historically and divided into five units. Although the readings will proceed more or less
chronologically, each unit will include one or more recent or contemporary work. Students will
be encouraged throughout the course to make thematic connections between the literature
and historical circumstances of earlier periods and the cultural products and social issues of
contemporary life.

Course Objectives
This course will: introduce students to the study of American literature; model methods of

literary and cultural interpretation; help students to improve their critical thinking and reading
skills. Please note: E316M may be used to fulfill the Humanities component of the University
Core Curriculum. As a result, the course addresses the following four core objectives
established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board: communication skills; critical
thinking skills; personal responsibility; and social responsibility. In addition, this course carries
the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural experience.

Edition (Norton; ISBN: 978-039329056 [print and electronic]; 978-0393918854 [print

Shorter Eighth Edition, you may also use the recently published Shorter Ninth Edition,

volume set and may be easier for you to obtain than the 8th. Page numbers for the
Shorter Ninth edition can be found here.

Course Requirements and Evaluation Method
Weekly Tutorial Participation (20% of final grade)

Students are required to take part in weekly, online, 10-minute tutorials with their Teaching
Assistants during each of the four full weeks of the summer session (starting with the week of
June 8). These tutorials will typically meet on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday. Tutorialparticipation will be measured by, among other things, quality of insights, familiarity with the
material, responsiveness to the ideas and comments of their Teaching Assistant, and willingness
to take intellectual risks. These sessions are much more than virtual office hours; they are an
opportunity to show engagement with the course texts and lectures and to take part in a one-
on-one interpretive exchange. TAs will contact the students in their sections before the official
start of the summer term to explain how to log in for tutorials and to establish a tutorial
schedule. Students will select their weekly tutorial time slot from among their TA's available
hours and then be responsible for attending the tutorial at that time. NB: A missed tutorial
appointment will result in 0/50 points for the week. Graded tutorials begin with Unit |, but we
are asking that you take part in an ungraded 5-minute tutorial between June 4 and June 7 to
meet your TA and orient you to the format and expectations of the subsequent graded
tutorials.

Reading and Lecture Quizzes (20% of final grade)

Each unit will culminate in a 10-minute quiz over the unit's readings and lectures. Quiz
questions will be multiple choice or true/false. Each quiz will consist of 10 questions and be
worth 50 points.

Visions and Revisions (20% of final grade)

In addition to tutorials and quizzes, students will be asked to complete four end-of-unit writing
exercises. Each of these short critical and/or creative assignments is worth 50 points. There is
an optional, fifth "Visions and Revisions" worth 10 extra credit points.

Final Examination (40% of final grade)

There will be a three-hour, cumulative online final examination. The examination will have
three parts: 1) a 10-question quiz over Unit V's readings and lectures (50 points); 2) a CRIT of a
poem not included on the syllabus (150 points); and 3) a series of analyses of passages from
across the syllabus (200 points). Details on the final examination will follow shortly.

Grading Rubric
Letter grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric:

B+ = 870-899 C+ = 770-799 D+ = 670-699 F = 0-599
A = 940-1000 B = 840-869 C = 740-769 D = 640-669

A- = 900-939 B- = 800-839 C- = 700-739 D- = 600-639

NB: Final grades will not be rounded up.

A Note on Reading for this Course

Studying literature often requires us to engage with uncomfortable and even offensive content.
In this course we will address such content in a forthright and mature fashion, using our critical
thinking, reading, and writing skills to both critique and contextualize it. At the same time,
respect for the course community and one another's experiences and viewpoints is paramount.
