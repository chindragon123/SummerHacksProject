I. COURSE DESCRIPTION: This course serves as an introduction to the study of the Spanish language. The
course is divided into two major components: 1) Structure of the Spanish Language, where we look at the
Spanish language as a rule-governed system of signs and 2) Language Contact and Bilingualism, where we
look at how the histories and the socio-cultural factors interact with the Spanish language in Spain, Hispanic
America, and the US. In addition, we look at some of the major dialectal differences with regard to
phonology, morphology, and morphosyntax. The specific topics to be covered in each component are the
following:

Component I: Structure of the Spanish Language and Variation
Topic 1 Phonetics/phonology
Topic 2 Morphology (General Concepts and Inflection)
Topic 3 Syntax
Topic 4: Dialectal Variation (Phonology, Morpholgy & Morpho-syntax)

Component IJ: Language Contact and bilingualism

Topic 1 Histories of the Spanish Language and Language Contact in Iberian Peninsula
Topic 2 Language Contact in Hispanic America
Topic 3 Bilingualism: Fundamental Concepts

Topic 4 Spanish-English Bilingualism in the US
Prerequisite: SPN 611D, D612, or 312L

II. COURSE FLAGS

SPN 330L carries a Global Cultures Flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your familiarity
with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your
grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S.

cultural group, past or present.

VI. Rules pertaining to Tests, Review Quizzes, and Homework

1. Missed exams can ONLY be made up when the instructor judges that the student has a legitimate
reason for his inablility to take the exam. Two such reasons are: a) critical illness and b) an
emergency pertaining to you or your immediate family, and c) a sudden unexpected loss of internet/wifi
connection. However, for both circumstances, you must present a statement (e.g. doctor’s note)
substantiating them. For other cases, consult the instructor.

2. No missed review quiz can be made up under any circumstances, because the lowest grade (=missed
quiz) will be replaced by an extra one towards the end of the session.

3. Asa general rule, a missed oral presentation cannot be rescheduled unless there is a legitimate
reason such as an unexpected emergency or illness.

4. Neither an exam nor a review quiz can be given, as a general rule, before the designated dates and
hours.

5. All homework assignments must be submitted through CANVAS (> Assignment) by the deadline.
No late work will be accepted unless there is a legitimate reason and a special arrangement for late
submission is made beforehand with the instructor.

6. In case of extended illness or serious emergency, notify the instructor immediately to make
arrangements for completing any missed work.

7. If you miss class, you must first contact someone from class and find out what was covered in class
and what the assignment is for the next class. Do not e-mail the instructor requesting such information. If
necessary, borrow notes from someone and ask him/her to go over them with you ahead of the following
class. Also, do not ask the instructor to repeat the lecture you missed during the
office hours. Office hours are to be used to ask specific questions and clarify doubts.

VII. Academic Accommodations:
I will be available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that you may require as a student
with a disability. Before I can make course accommodations, you must provide documentation from the
Office of the Dean of Students-Services for Students with Disabilities. (This is in compliance with the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973-Section 504 and the Americans with

Disabilities Act/ADA.)
