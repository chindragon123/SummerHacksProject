What does it mean to be a man? Hiding in plain sight, the idea of masculinity is often taken
for granted in American culture. Whereas femininity is discussed at length in the media and
popular culture—through national debates about “leaning in,” for instance, or girls’ and
women’s struggles with body image—masculinity is rarely given the same attention. Yet
masculinity, like femininity, is constructed by cultural ideas about sex, gender, class, and
race and has changed dramatically over time. Moreover, ideas about manhood and
masculinity have shaped American political, economic, and cultural history in profound
ways.

This course explores varied ideas about masculinity in the U.S. from the nineteenth century
through the present. We will focus on four primary questions: How have the meanings of
manhood changed over time? How have ideas about manhood and manliness affected the
history of work in the U.S.? How have ideas about masculinity impacted U.S. international
relations? And how do ideas of masculinity intersect with ideas about race, class, and
sexuality? Through these questions, we will consider how masculinity relates to ideas about
violence and self-sufficiency. We will engage with interdisciplinary literature in history,
American Studies, urban studies, gender studies, and anthropology to answer these
questions.

Course Format

As is the case with every course this summer, COVID-19 has mandated some big changes to how
courses are being offered. This course would usually meet five days per week in person. Instead, we
will meet three days per week, with other work being done asynchronously. It is imperative that you
keep up with the pace of the course, since we have very limited time together. If you find yourself concerned
about keeping up, please get in touch with me.

This is a discussion seminar, and we will spend most of our time in our Zoom meetings discussing
the assigned readings. These in-person synchronous meetings will be supplemented with weekly
asynchronous lessons that are required. These may take the form of short documentary videos, video
lectures from me, or other material. However, the emphasis each week will be on discussion of both
the assigned reading and primary materials that we will examine together in class.

Because of this format, it is essential that you complete all of the assigned reading each week. If you
have concerns about keeping up with the reading, please get in touch with me immediately.

The aim of this course is help you to think historically and analytically. We will work to figure out
what we are able to know about the past; which sources can help us to get at that knowledge; and
what the limits and silences of various types of sources might be. At the same time, we will consider
how the authors we read construct arguments, and we will critically evaluate the persuasiveness of
these arguments. Ultimately, you will be working out the tensions inherent in thinking through how
the past can—and should—matter in the present.

Learning Objectives
At the end of this course, students will:

1. have a deeper knowledge of the history of gender and masculinity in the United States.

2. be able to understand and articulate the ideas and perspectives of historical actors.

3. have a greater understanding of how historians construct arguments based on historical
research.
be able to evaluate primary source evidence in relation to secondary sources.

5- be able to construct an original argument from an evaluation of primary source evidence.Flags

This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are designed to
engage you in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing you with the
opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related to your major.
You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from the independent
investigation and presentation of your own work.

This course also carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly
during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your
instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or
more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes
meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and
Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

Attendance and Participation

You are expected to attend every scheduled Zoom session class and to come prepared. Class sessions
will primarily involve discussion of the assigned texts, and if you are absent or unprepared, you will
not be participating fully in the course and it will adversely affect your grade. You are expected to
be an active participant in the class, which means meaningfully contributing to classroom
discussions. If you have concerns about classroom participation, please come discuss it with me — we
may be able to make modified arrangements if speaking up in class is challenging for you.

If you are going to be absent, you must notify me by email, in advance if possible. If you need to
miss class for medical or religious reasons, your absence will be excused as long as you notify me. By
UT-Austin policy, you must notify me of a pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date
of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or
a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the
missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.

All documentation for excused absences is due at the latest one week after the date of the absence.
If you have three unexcused absences, your final course grade will be lowered by 1/3 letter grade for
each subsequent absence (i.e. a final grade of an A- becomes a B+ if you have four unexcused

absences, or a B if you have five). Please note that excessive tardiness will also affect your grade.

do not have your cell phone out during class. (If you are expecting an emergency call or otherwise
need to have your phone available during class, please let me know.)

Students adding the course after the first meeting must make up missed assignments. Please contact
me immediately in person or via email to make up missed work.] prefer to communicate by email. I will be communicating to the class via email throughout the
semester, and I will be using only your UT email address unless you instruct me otherwise. Please
make sure that your UT email address is working and that your mailbox has space. You must check
your UT email daily. You are responsible for all communications sent via email.

*Attendance & Participation

There are three components to your attendance and participation grade:

1. Attendance and preparation. Your attendance and class participation grade depend on your
coming to class prepared and participating in discussion. Preparation involves doing the
required readings and completing the required supplemental lessons on Canvas.

2. Weekly content questions. In addition, part of your participation grade will be the weekly
submission of an anonymous content question. Via Canvas on the “quizzes” tab, you can
submit any question of your choosing. Your question should be a basic question about the
content of the reading or the course — for instance, | don’t know what the Industrial Revolution
is, can you explain it? At the beginning of our Zoom sessions, I will answer the questions |
have received. I will not be able to see who submitted each question (so feel free to ask any
questions you worry are “dumb”!), but I will be able to see how many questions you
submitted each week. You are required to submit at least one question per week.

3. Class Slack channel. You should participate in the course Slack channel. There is no formal
requirement for how much you must participate, but you are expected to chime in on the
ongoing class discussion.

** Reflection Journal

You are expected to keep a Reflection Journal (a text document on your computer is fine). Each
week, you must make at least one entry in which you reflect on the readings and supplemental
lessons. Your total journal should be at minimum seven typed pages (double-spaced) by the end
of the term.

*** Primary Source Analysis, Synthesis Essay, and Final Essay
We will discuss your two short papers (the primary source analysis and the synthesis essay) in

class. Your final essay will be a 7-8 paper in which you place 2-3 sources of your choosing into
conversation with the course readings for the term. We will discuss how to choose a topic and
find sources more thoroughly in class.All papers should be submitted electronically via the class Canvas site.

You need to secure an excuse from me at least 3 days before the due date if you have a legitimate
reason to turn in work late. Unexcused late work will lose 1/3 of a letter grade per day late and will
receive a failing grade after 5 days. No extensions will be granted for more than 3 days beyond the
original due date except in the most extreme circumstances.

Lateness policy for the Final Essay: Your final essay is due on June 11 by 11:59pm. Unless you have
prior authorization from me to turn it in late, for each hour that your paper is late, you will be

deducted 1/3 letter grade.

Grading Guidelines

We will discuss writing expectations clearly and thoroughly in class before the first assignment is
due. In general, you should strive for the following in your essays:

e Your essay should not simply summarize the material but analyze it.

e You should have a clear and debatable argument.

e You should clearly use evidence from your sources.

e You should demonstrate critical thinking in your writing.

Title IX Reporting

Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally
funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working
environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our
community, the university can:

1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.

2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or

have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university's relevant policies.

Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities,
including faculty, report any information to the Title [IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual
assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas law requires that all employees
who witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not limited to, writing
assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. I am a Responsible
Employee and must report any Title [X related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or
one-on-one.

Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be
sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you would like to speak with someone who
can provide support or remedies without making an official report to the university, please email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources,
