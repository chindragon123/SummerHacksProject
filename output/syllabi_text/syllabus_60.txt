Signals and Systems, 3rd Edition, M.J. Roberts, McGraw-Hill, 2018, McGraw-Hill (Online McGraw-Hill
Connect Edition, accessed directly from Canvas).

Software
You will be required to use MATLAB in this course. MATLAB is available through the University.

Course Website

Use of the cloud-hosted learning management system, McGraw-Hill's Connect system and UT's
Canvas system, will be used throughout this course. In addition, Piazza will be used for Q/A and
student discussions.

Course Objectives

This course is meant to prepare you for your electrical engineering education by providing an
abstraction of a large class of engineering systems and tools for analyzing them. Many fields of
engineering can be reduced to creating a series of block diagrams (systems) and analyzing the
properties of the signals that move through the system. By the end of this course, you will be able to
analyze and design systems by simply examining their input and output signals. You will be able to
compute a system output in either the time or frequency domain given the system input and a
description of the system, using the Laplace, Fourier, or z-transform, as appropriate. You will
understand the differences and similarities between discrete and continuous time signals and systems.

Catalog Description

Representation of signals and systems; system properties; sampling; Laplace and z-transforms;
transfer functions and frequency response; convolution; stability; Fourier transform; feedback; and
control applications. Computer analysis using MATLAB.

Prerequisites

Biomedical Engineering 311, Electrical Engineering 411, or 331 with a grade of at least C-;
Mathematics 427J or 427K with a grade of at least C-; and credit with a grade of at least C- or
registration for Mathematics 340L.

Grading Policy

The numerical course grade is computed by weighting the raw scores as indicated below. A final
course grade may be adjusted on a curve rather than an absolute scale. Final grades will be assigned
using plus and minus increments. A course/instructor survey will be conducted at the end of the
semester via the standard MEC form for the Instructor and each Teaching Assistant.

Lectures

The lectures will take place at the normally scheduled time. It is anticipated each lecture will be
recorded for those that may not have Internet access at the normal lecture time. These recordings
should generally be available later in the same day as lecture. Attendance and participation during
lecture is expected and required for examinations (see below). Questions and feedback during lecture
is important.

Homework & MATLAB assignments

There will be about 12 to 15 homework assignments during the semester. Homework is completed and
submitted through Connect or Canvas. No late submission will be graded. Homework will be made
available on Connect, generally, a week before the due date. Announcements will be made during
lecture and on Canvas regarding changes. You are responsible for checking the due dates on Canvas.

LearnSmart Book Activities

The online interactive book contains a number of Questions/Activities as part of your reading
assignments. You are required to complete all activities in each assigned section. The due date for the
completion of all activities for a given section/chapter will be announced in class and on the Connect
website. You will not receive credit after the due date.

Examinations

There will be about four semester examinations and a final examination, all administered and proctored
online. The examinations will test your Knowledge of the material presented during lecture, your
homework assignments, the PowerPoint slides, and the book's material. In addition, | will test your
ability to apply the material presented. The four semester exams are scheduled during normal class
times. The Final Exam will be scheduled per the University's Final Exam schedule and will be
administered and proctored online.

The examinations will consist of a number of questions to be answered in a given time period. The
exams are closed-book, closed-notes, no additional resources are to be used. All exams will be
administered via Canvas and will be proctored using online monitoring resources. You must have your
laptop/computer video active during the examinations. There are no make-up examinations. Excused
absence from an examination must be approved in advance. Absence is excused only in extreme
circumstances (serious illness, death in the immediate family, etc.). Requests for excused absences
should be made in writing and must be supported by appropriate documentation. Unexcused absence
from an examination will result in a grade of zero for that examination.

There is no re-grading of examinations, unless you feel that there is an error. In this case, you should
submit a written (email) request. Verbal requests will not be considered. An examination grade will not
be changed one week after the exam has been graded.

A basic, non-programmable, scientific calculator (e.g., TIl-30Xa, TI-30X IIS, or equivalent), will be

needed during the exams. You are not allowed to use a programmable or graphing calculator. For
example, the TI-83, Tl-84, Tl-Nspire or the like, will not be permitted for use during exams.

Page 3 of 6UNIVERSITY POLICIES

Religious Holy Days

Students shall be excused from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations,
for the observance of a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is
excused will not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete
an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence.
University policy required students to notify each of their instructors as far in advance of the absence as
possible so that arrangements can be made.

Policy on Academic Integrity

Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student
of The University of Texas at Austin, | shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold
academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that
are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Plagiarism
applies to all assignments in this course including software/firmware source codes.

Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on academic
dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, please visit the Student Conduct and
Academic Integrity website at:http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct.

You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code.

Q Drop Policy

If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you'll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only
allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop

University Resources for Students

Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn
differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let
me know as soon as possible. Together we'll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the
requirements of the course. There are also a range of resources on campus:

Services for Students with Disabilities

This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical
information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building
needs to be evacuated, please let me know. | am committed to creating an effective learning
environment for all students, but | can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as
possible. | promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact
Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone).

Counseling and Mental Health Center

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and
cope with stress.

Page 4 of 6All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful
resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask
for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety
or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.
