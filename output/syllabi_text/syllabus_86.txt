About the Course

UT’s motto is “What starts here changes the world.” In RHE 306 Rhetoric & Writing, you will
take the first step in changing the world by learning how to argue effectively in the public
sphere.

In this class, you will learn how to examine a public controversy, analyze various positions
that people hold in that controversy, and effectively advocate your own position. You will
also explore the ethics of argumentation, explaining what it means to “fairly” represent
someone with whom you disagree, or how responsibly to address a community with
particular values and interests. Your work in this course will help you advance the critical
writing and reading skills you will need to succeed in courses for your major and university
degree.

This course may be used to fulfill three hours of the communication component of the
university core curriculum and addresses the following four core course objectives
established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical
thinking skills, teamwork, and personal responsibility.

You will learn how to:

= Understand a range of positions in a local controversy

= Analyze and evaluate an argument about a local controversy, using rhetorical tools
= Argue that the controversy needs a solution and/or argue for a particular solution
= Propose a specific, implementable solution based on collaborative research

Given the constraints of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we will be pursuing these learning
goals entirely online and asynchronously, meaning there is no regular meeting time.
Expectations for how we will all maintain daily engagement will be explained further at the
start of the term.Textbooks

Coursework & Grading
You will be graded on the following assignments this term:

= Project 1: Annotated Bibliography: 15%

= Project 2.1: Rhetorical Analysis: 10%

= Project 2.2: Rhetorical Analysis Revision: 15%
= Project 3 Draft & Peer Review: 5%

= Project 3: Proposal Argument: 25%

= Project 4: Infographic: 10%

= Process Work & Participation: 20%

Final grades will be determined on the following scale. Please note: To ensure fairness, all
numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. For example, a B-
will be inclusive of all scores of 80.0000 through 83.9999. The University does not recognize
the grade of At.

» A=94-100 = B-=80-83 = D+=67-69
» A-=90-93 » Ct=77-79 = D=64-66

= B+=87-89 » C=74-76 = D-=60-63
= B=84-86 » C-=70-73 » F=0-59

Unit Projects

At the end of each of our 3 units, you will write an annotated bibliography, two essays
ranging from 4-7 pages each (above designated Rhetorical Analysis and Proposal Argument),
and an infographic. You will also be graded on your revision of the Rhetorical Analysis based
on my feedback, and you will be graded on your participation in Project 3’s peer review. In
addition, you will compose four short writing assignments.

In order to receive a passing mark for the course, regardless of your performance on other
assignments or total average of all your grades, all major assignments must be completed to
my satisfaction.Process Work & Participation

Because active involvement with course content class is an essential component of getting
the most out of this course, participation will be a measured aspect of your grade. To provide
opportunities for a variety of styles of participation, there will be a number of approaches
offered throughout the term to fulfill this requirement including: written response posts,
discussion boards, and group activities. These will all be clearly established and facilitated on
Canvas.

Course Policies

Title IX Reporting

Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence, and stalking at
federally funded educational institutions. The university is committed to providing support
and resources as well as to investigating in the case of any such incidents.

As an instructor, | am required by law to report any Title IX related incidents that are
disclosed in writing or discussion. If you want to speak with someone without an official
report being made, you can email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information, visit
http://www.titleix.utexas.edu.

Accessibility

Your success in this class is important to me. If there are aspects of this course that prevent
you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we'll
develop strategies to meet both your needs and course requirements.

| am committed to making all course materials as accessible as possible, and to working
with students if any of these materials are inaccessible. We will all need some
accommodations in this class, because we all learn differently. If you need specific
accommodations, let me know. Any conversations we have about accommodations are
confidential. | am happy to take extra steps to ensure accessibility for all students.

Safe Space Policy

This class will always strive to be a safe space for learning and development; that is, a space
where we can develop and refine the knowledge and skills necessary for culturally competent
practice. Learning requires stretching beyond comfort zones, and yet feeling safe is a
prerequisite for a good learning environment. As we all bring diverse experiences to our
shared classroom, below are some general guidelines to help create the environment we
want.Behavior

Be respectful of your colleagues. There is zero tolerance for slurs or derogatory language. In
general, don’t discriminate based on race, gender presentation, marital status, religion,
disability, age, or sexual orientation.

Everyone in our class has the right to be addressed in accordance with their personal identity.
The university provides me with a class roster containing each student’s legal name and sex
marker. | will gladly address you by the name and gender pronoun with which you identify.
Please let me know your preferred name and pronouns early in the semester, so your peers
and | can address you appropriately.

If you find a reading or assignment triggering in any way, or suspect that you will be
triggered, please contact me as soon as possible. | am happy to speak with you about the
content of the material in advance and/or provide you with an alternative assignment. If you
are troubled by or feel unsafe in any class discussion, please speak with me as soon as
possible so that we can work to resolve the immediate problem and prevent future issues.

Learning Procedures

It is never okay to laugh at, belittle, or harass a colleague because of their opinion or point of
view. Always think about how your comments will support our learning as a group. But safe
doesn’t mean operating in an environment where beliefs and ideas go unchallenged.
Challenging colleagues to explain their arguments in a thoughtful manner is key to creating
an engaging learning community.

=» Make acommitment to understand unfamiliar positions from the context or point of view
of your peers.

= Speak for yourself rather than for a group (use your “I” statements).

=" Be present — really listening to your colleagues will dramatically improve your in-class
experience and prevent most understandings.

= Take risks in speaking honestly; this will help the learning of the group.

Late Work

All assignments, including due dates and submission instructions, are documented on Canvas.
For each day that an assignment is turned in past the deadline, half a letter grade will be
deducted from the assigned grade.Dept of Rhetoric & Writing Policies Statement

Scholastic Honesty

Turning in work that is not your own, or any other form of scholastic dishonesty, will result in
a major course penalty, possibly failure of the course. This standard applies to a// drafts and
assignments, and a report of the incident will be submitted to the Office of the Dean of
Students and filed in your permanent UT record. Under certain circumstances, the Dean of
Students will initiate proceedings to expel you from the University.

So, take care to read and understand the Statement on Scholastic Responsibility, which can
be found online at
https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/rhetoric/RHE%20306/plagiarismcollusion.php If you have any
doubts about your use of sources, ask your instructor for help before handing in the
assignment.

Students with Disabilities

Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should
contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-
3986 (video phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized

website at http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/

Title IX and Senate Bill 212

Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of Texas universities,
including faculty, report any information to the Title IX Office regarding sexual harassment,
sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas law requires that
all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not limited
to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be reported. If
you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without making
an official report to the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more
information about reporting options and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/,
contact the Title IX Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512-471-0419.

Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212,
they are still mandatory reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a
wide range of behaviors we refer to as sexual misconduct, including the types of sexual
misconduct covered under Texas Senate Bill 212. The Title IX office has developed supportive
ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to support survivors.Climate Statement

At the Department of Rhetoric and Writing, we are unambiguous in our commitment to
fostering a diverse, inclusive, and respectful professional and educational climate. For more
information on our climate commitments, see the complete climate statement at

climate-related concerns, please contact the chair of the climate advisory committee:
Professor Scott Graham (ssg@utexas.edu).
