COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course will provide a critical overview of the various theoretical perspectives and the research
on second-language acquisition, with particular implications to teaching and learning in K-12
urban classroom settings. We will employ a sociocultural framework to analyze cross-language
dimensions and the variety of contexts of interaction involved when learning an additional
language, including English and Spanish. Our discussions will include language variation,
bi/multilingualism, ideologies towards second-language assessment and instructional applications.

COURSE POLICIES

Quality of Work: All written assignments should be typed, double- spaced (12-point font), and
edited for spelling and grammar. Graduate and upper division level work is expected for all
assignments. The final paper must follow APA style. For help with APA style, please visit
http://www.apastyle.org/learn/tutorials/basics-tutorial.aspx for a tutorial. The APA website
(http://www.apastyle.org) also offers more resources and guidance on specific questions.On time Submissions: Please submit your work on time. Late submissions may be penalized at
the discretion of the instructor, except in cases of medical emergencies. If you encounter a major
disruption in your life and need extra time, I am willing to work with you; in such cases, please
make a request as early as possible.

Absences: Except for special cases, I do not distinguish between “excused” and “unexcused”
absences. Absences and habitual tardiness will affect your grade for class participation. Every two
absences usually constitute a course letter grade reduction. If you are unable to attend class, please
let me know ahead of time. Two absences usually result in a letter-grade reduction. If you must be
absent on a day when you are scheduled to present, it is imperative that you let me know several
days in advance.

Use of Technology: Please silence or turn off your cell phones during class time. If you need to
take a call or send a text message, you may do so after our zoom meeting time. Please refrain
from surfing the net, messaging, checking e-mail, shopping, doing research, downloading pictures
or videos, or completing assignments for other classes in your laptops during our meetings.

Use of e-mail and Canvas: All assignments must be submitted electronically through Canvas.
Please note that we will also use Canvas for all communication. Announcements, updates, and
new documents during the course will be emailed and posted on Canvas.

UNIVERSITY POLICIES

Academic Honesty: All students are expected to demonstrate high ethical behavior and conform
to the terms and conditions of The University of Texas at Austin Honor Code. The core values of
The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold these values
through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community. Violating
University rules on academic honesty can lead to disciplinary penalties, including failing grades
and/or dismissal from the University. Because such dishonesty harms the individual, fellow
students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. The Student Judicial Services Web site has more information in the Office of the Dean
of Students section at: http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/

Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact
the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY.

Religious Holidays: UT policy requires students to notify the professor of an upcoming absence
due to a religious holiday at least fourteen days prior to the day to be missed. Work missed as a
result of the holiday can be made up within a reasonable period of time following the absence.ASSIGNMENTS
WRITTEN CRITICAL READING COMMENTARIES (30% of final grade)

In addition to the class textbook, a number of readings will be available on the Canvas site. You
are expected to read the assigned readings prior to class each day and except for the day that you
present and facilitate, write a critical reading commentary (CRC) on the topic of the day no later
than 9 am that day. Please identify ONE theme, topic or section in the assigned readings which
interested you the most and write a CRC. Consider bringing your annotations of each week’s
readings to our zoom meeting for reference during class discussions.

Procedure for writing your critical commentaries:

a) Title(s) — List the reading that you are discussing.

b) Brief summary — Provide a brief summary of ONE theme/topic/section in the reading that
you found interesting.

c) Response —Share the results of your interaction with the text, so others can gain new insights
from your perspectives. What connections can you make to your experiences or observations?
Did you agree / disagree? Why? Any new insights from the reading? How does it relate to other
readings for this class or others? What critical perspectives can you offer?

e Please write between two to three paragraphs for each CRC and post the CRC to the CRC
Discussion Board on Canvas no later than 9:00 a.m. before class.

e While informal, please carefully edit CRC for spelling, grammar, syntax and clarity

e You will receive a grade for each individual commentary

e You will periodically be given time in class to read and respond to your classmates’
commentaries.

NOTE: you will not be expected to submit a CRC on the day that you present and facilitate (see
calendar for dates). This means that you are required to submit a total of 9 CRCs on your own;
one written class activity will count towards the tenth CRC.

For tips on how to read academic texts productively, I strongly recommend you browse Zachary
Shore’s chapter on how to read an academic text, available at:

https://content.ucpress.edu/chapters/13060.Ch01.pdf. You can also access a copy of the chapter
via Canvas.

ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION IN WHOLE GROUP (15%)

The building of knowledge in this course will be based on oral and written responses
communicated in real-time and asynchronously, as well as presentations and online discussions
and interactions with colleagues. You are expected to be present and to participate in a variety
ways when we meet as a whole group. Because the course is founded on critical frameworks, the
material will include diverse perspectives, not necessarily aligning with traditional or dominant
views, in order to expand the parameters of our thinking. I encourage you to engage in candid,honest, respectful, and thoughtful dialogue, based on a common expectation that alternative sides
of an issue will be considered.

PARTICIPATION IN SMALL GROUP DISCUSSIONS (10 %)

This assignment provides you with practice in working in groups to address a scenario or question
related to the process of second language acquisition in urban settings from a critical perspective.
You will work in groups of three (one with four) to meet and address a discussion prompt
generated from the day’s readings, and then one representative from the group will share the
reactions with the rest of the class. You will have the opportunity to assess yourself for this
assignment. At the end of the course (see calendar) please upload a self-reflection of your
participation in small groups, giving yourself a final grade for this assignment, out of 10 total
points. Please mention one or more of the following in your self-reflection: 1) to what extent you
integrated class readings into participation, 2) how much awareness or interaction you displayed;
3) your attitude during group discussions; 4) to what extent you were able to make connections to
classroom contexts or to research during group discussions.

PAIRED PRESENTATIONS AND FACILITATIONS (15 %)

This assignment provides you with practice in summarizing, presenting and critiquing research,
and in engaging other students in a critical discussion on scholarly articles and/or book chapters
from the perspective of classroom applications and/or research. You will work in pairs to prepare
a short presentation and lead one discussion based on one or more readings from the available
ones assigned each day. You will have a choice of dates on a ‘first come, first served’ basis.

The sequence and format of this discussion are flexible. For example, in terms of sequence, you
might choose to present some of the key points before inviting discussion. Another option would
be to invite discussion before summarizing the key points. A third option would be to move back
and forth between discussion and presentation. This is entirely up to you. For facilitation, you
may consider including questions or specific oral and written activities, as possible in a zoom
environment. With respect to format, please use Google slides as we will embed each
presentation to the corresponding page in Canvas.

In terms of what is required, please do the following:

Prepare a short presentation with brief summary or overview of the author’s key points (consider
emphasizing relevant terms and concepts, and making connections to other course readings
and/or topics)

Share your pair’s thoughts/reflections on the text (including relevant critiques, questions, and/or
connections to personal experiences as students, teachers, speakers), and to relevant course
themes/topics

Design an activity to engage the other students with your topic and to stimulate discussion and
critical perspectives

Facilitate discussion in such a way that all students are encouraged to participate and contribute
(you may want to post discussion prompts to be addressed via Canvas.

Paired presentations and facilitations should last between 30- 40 minutes.The day before you present, please upload a Google slides presentation embedded to Pages in
Canvas containing the presentation and the questions/activities you used to engage students
(instructions will be given and an example will be provided). Please make sure the title of your
presentation follows the following format: “Presentation title, Last Name, Last Name”.

LANGUAGE INTERVIEW AND REPORT (30%)

This assignment is an opportunity for you to articulate your understanding of second language
acquisition theory, and how the latter informs your analysis and ideas about the language
processes, the experiences, and the instructional or research approaches that can support
language learners. The report will be divided in two parts.

Part 1: Interview and Description of Language Learner (3-5 pgs.)

There will be two options for the interview part of the assignment. Choose the first option if your
goal is to use the interview to analyze the speech sample of your participant in order to design
adequate pedagogies. Choose the second option if your goal is to understand the language
experiences of your participant, also to inform appropriate pedagogies.

Option I: gathering a speech sample

You will interview an individual who is currently engaged in learning English as a second
language. Your subject can be any age or level (beginning, intermediate, or advanced). Interview
that individual in English for at least 15 minutes and audiotape the interview (with permission
from your interviewee). If this is not possible, take very detailed notes.

Following the interview, transcribe and/or analyze the language sample in the interview, and
write a paper analyzing the individual’s use of English. Choose one example of pronunciation,
one example of grammar, one example of word choice/vocabulary, and one example of
discourse/pragmatics that the individual used. Analyze these examples based on the readings and
our critical classroom discussions.

The interview section of the paper should be 3-4 pages (not to exceed 4 pages), not including the
title page and references. Interview transcript and notes should be included as an

appendix. Please note that the purpose of the interview for this option is to obtain a speech
sample for analysis, not to analyze the participant's personal narrative.

Option 2: gathering a personal narrative
You will interview an individual who is currently engaged in learning English as a second
language. Your subject can be any age or level (beginning, advanced, etc.) Interview that
individual in English for at least 15 minutes and either audiotape the interview (with permission
from your interviewee) or take very detailed notes. Consider addressing some of the following
aspects during your interview:

Age at which your interviewee began learning English as a second language

Reasons for wanting or needing to learn EnglishCircumstances for learning English (e.g., 1n school, on the job, in an English- speaking
country or elsewhere, from friends)? If in school, consider obtaining information on
school language classes/programs and scheduling/time

Ideas and feelings about the school experiences and instructional practices

Ideas and feelings about what could have been better in his/her learning experience
Strategies employed and feelings about the experience of communicating in English
Any anecdotes about the experiences of learning English

Learner characteristics: (attitudes, motivation, beliefs, anxiety, etc.)

Rewards and frustrations of learning English a second language

Any other information you think is relevant

Following the interview, transcribe the interview and write a paper describing your participant’s
use of language (option 1) or language experience (option 2) learning English as a second
language. The interview description section of the paper should be 3-4 pages (not to exceed 4
pages), not including the title page and references. Interview transcript and notes should be
included as an appendix.

Part 2: Reflection on principles and Practices (4-5 pgs.) Please identify 2-3 broad principles
or concepts that you have learned in this course related to second language acquisition that are
relevant to the analysis of the speech sample (option 1) or to the experience of your participant
(option 2). Please describe each principle or concept, citing the necessary literature from course
readings. Offer your approach for an ideal language learning situation for your subject. Describe
your proposal for situations/experiences that others should arrange for the learner (including
teachers/instructors, parents, educational institutions, etc.) to help him/her learn the language
based on the principle/concept. Be specific as to why your proposal is ideal for your learner
based on the literature reviewed in class to support your claims. If applicable, explain how you
would incorporate the principle/concept in your own research or teaching practice in the future.

This assignment will consist of several components, and prepared in stages:
On June 8, you will share your initial ideas regarding your language learner interview

On June 12, you will share your interview plan: option you selected and why, goals of our
interview, who you will interview, questions you will ask, and what you expect to learn from
your interview

On either June 18 or 22 (depending upon sign-up), you will informally present the process and
the results of your interview. Prepare a PowerPoint or other form of visual to present the main
insights of your language learner project to your peers in class. Due to the time constraint, it’s
important that you prepare your presentation well to avoid getting cut off in the middle of it.
Please upload the transcript of your interview that day.

No later than June 26, please upload your language learner report, consisting of three parts: 1) a
description of your learner’s language (option 1) or experience (option 2), with a maximum of 4
pages ; 2) your reflections, with a maximum of 5 pages; 3) an appendix with the transcript or
detailed notes of the information you generated in the interview.CLASS SCHEDULE (Subject to chang
