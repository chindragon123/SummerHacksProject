A. Description

These combined online courses meet in joint synchronous sessions which serve to
reinforce speaking, grammar and cultural aspects of Portuguese and the Portuguese
speaking world. We are also combining students from the University of Texas at Austin
and the University of Georgia at Athens. The premise of the course is to help students
prepare oral presentations to demonstrate the ability to perform intermediate, advanced or
superior-level tasks in Portuguese. Students prepare for the performance tasks by
combining course lectures, online materials and individual practice with tutors. Every day
students participate in two 90-minute online synchronous video conferences. The first,
from 9:00 — 10:30 focuses on language and the second, from 10:30 — 12:00 keys on
cultural competency.

While the focus of the language portion (9:00 — 10:30) is to perform the various speaking,
grammar and culture tasks, the actual tasks depend on the general proficiency level of
each individual student. Students enrolled in POR f611D focus on topics that are
appropriate to their level and their challenge. Students who are enrolled in POR f611S
and POR 375 / POR £353 do likewise. That 1s to say, in class students participate in the
same activity (orally demonstrating the ability to perform speaking, grammar and culture
tasks) but each student prepares tasks that are appropriate to their individual needs,
interests, and level. Every week students also listen to three asynchronous lessons from
any of the online materials that are part of the BrazilPod series from the University ofTexas at Austin. Additionally, every week students meet for three hours with their tutor
for individual practice and can-do pass-offs.

The premise of the cultural competency portion (10:30 — 12:00) is to approximate a
Summer study abroad experience, keeping many aspects of cultural excursions you might
otherwise be taking in Brazil and involving different faculty from UFSJ, UGA, and UT.
Class discussion focus on the cultural, economic, political, and socio-historical
importance of certain regions in Brazil. Class discussions will be complemented by
tutoring and “hand’s on” experiential learning sessions in small groups, (called “maos na
massa” — “hands in the dough’), where you will be “making things” (music, food, art,
movies, etc.) with an instructor and peers.

FLAS and FLAGSHIP: Please note that the total hours for this program is as follows:

Synchronous Online Class Sessions - 26 sessions x 3 hrs = 78hrs
Private Tutor Sessions - 6wks x 3 hrs = 18 hrs

Asynchronous BrazilPod Podcast Lessons — 6wks x 5 hrs = 30 hrs
Testing and Exams — 14 hrs

TOTAL = 140 hours

Monday July 13 — Thursday July 16
Note: This week we will dedicate all our time to proficiency testing and final
course testing.

D. Padlet Wall

We will be using a Padlet wall to make ancillary and electronic materials available to
students. The homepage padlet wall for this course is https://padlet.com/orkelm/pfp. You
will notice that the wall contains extra links, videos, articles, quizzes, surveys, bulletin
boards, mind maps that relate to the content of each topic.

E. Can-Do Pass-Off Assignments

The major assignment of the course is to orally demonstrate the ability to perform various
can-do tasks in Portuguese in the following areas:

e Speaking Tasks (Choose 15 from the appropriate level(s)
e Grammar Tasks (Choose 15 from the appropriate level(s))
e Social/Cultural Tasks (Choose 10 from the appropriate level(s)

All of these tasks are subdivided into general proficiency levels (Beginning, Intermediate,
Advanced, Superior). Given the general proficiency of each student, each student chooses
which specific tasks to work on. In class our lectures address topics related to the specific
tasks, based on student questions in the progress reports. In class there is also time
dedicated for practice pass-offs with classmates, tutors and instructor. Students then
perform the official can-do pass-off with their tutors. Students also prepare for their
presentations by meeting with individual tutors for practice and by studying the related
online materials from Brazilpod UT.

(Note: You can download the excel spreadsheet that lists the tasks from our padlet
homepage or from the files in canvas.)

It is the student’s responsibility to prepare for the presentation of the can-do assignments.
That is to say, the instructor does not prepare a test or quiz or exercise. It is the student
who prepares what he or she wants to do to demonstrate ability. Come prepared to show
that you have mastered the ability to perform the task.

Notice also that each task should be passed-off two times. The first informal practice
pass-off can be with a tutor, classmate, Brazilian or Portuguese speaking friend. The
second pass-off needs to be presented to the official tutor or instructor on the week
indicated in the syllabus.Each official can-do pass-off is worth 10 points, for a total of 400 points (15 x 10
speaking = 150; 15 x 10 grammar = 150; 10 x 10 social/cultural = 100).

F. Progress Report Assignments

On canvas you will find weekly Progress Report Assignments. Before every synchronous
class session (by 6:00am) students are required to complete the progress report, which
consists of the following items:

List the can-do pass-off topics (speaking, grammar, culture) you are working on.
List the three online lessons that you have listened to.

Write two observations of what you have learned from the online lessons.

Write two questions that you would like us to discuss as follow-up in class.

Each progress report assignment is worth 10 points, for a total of 50. Progress reports
need to be posted by 6:00am on the day they are due.

G. On-line Materials from Brazilpod

As students prepare for the can-do pass-off assignments and as they prepare for the
synchronous class sessions, every week you are also required to listen to at least 3 online
lessons from any of the materials on Brazilpod. When you prepare the weekly Progress
Report Assignment, include your observations and questions, which we will then discuss
and respond to in class.

Choose from any of the Brazilpod materials, those that are appropriate to your level and
related to the can-do topic:

e Portuguese Communication Exercises (video):

http://www. laits.utexas.edu/orkelm/ppe/intro.html

Ta Falado (audio podcast): https://coerll.utexas.edu/brazilpod/tafalado/
Lingua da Gente (audio podcast): https://linguadagente.coerll.utexas.edu/
Conversa Brasileira (video): https://coerll.utexas.edu/brazilpod/cob/
Talking Real Portuguese -Olha la (video podcast):
https://www.youtube.com/c/TalkingRealPortuguese

 

 

Points for the BrazilPod lessons are automatically assigned when a student submits a
Progress Report.

H. Goals for Online lessons and private tutoring
The private tutors for this course are composed of graduate students from either the

University of Texas at Austin or the University of Georgia at Athens. We also have tutors
who work with our Portuguese Flagship partner institution at the Universidade FederalSao Joao del Rei. The tutoring will be under the direction of Andreana Marchi (UTA),
Viviane de Souza Klen Alves (UGA), and Ana Paula de A. Lopez (UFSJ).

On canvas you will find weekly Goals for Online lessons and private tutoring that are due
on Fridays by 11:59pm. Students are required to complete the online Goals report, which
consists of the following items:

e List goals and plan of action for speaking, grammar and culture topics for the
coming week.

e List goals and plan of action for the online lessons for the coming week.

e List goals and topics for upcoming visits with private tutor.

Each goals report is worth 10 points, for a total of 50. Goal reports need to be posted by
11:59pm on the day they are due.

I. Grades for the Language Portion

The final grade is based on the percentage of total points earned (A = 94+, A- = 90+, B+
= 87+, B = 844, B- = 80+, C+ = 77+, C = 744, C- = 70+, D+ = 67+, D = 644, D- = 60+).
Scores are not rounded. No late work or make up work is allowed. Points are distributed
on the following basis:

150 pts Speaking Pass-Offs (15 x 10pts)

150 ptsGrammar Pass-Offs (15 x 10pts)

100 pts Social/Cultural Pass-Offs (10 x 10pts)
50 pts Progress Reports (5 x 10pts)
50 ptsGoals with Tutors (5 x 10pts)

500 pts TOTAL

J. Grades for the Culture Portion

Participation Grade: (60%)

This grade will be based upon your active participation in the following tasks during each
week:

 

Preparedness Engagement

Assigned readings 1 hour of pair tutoring (10%)
Multi-media texts (videos, film, music) | 1 hour of individual tutoring (10%)
Goals submitted Maos na Massa (10%)

2 Recorded Video Conversations (15%)
2 Written Assignments (15%)

To earn full participation credit, you need to complete the weekly readings, recorded

conversations, written assignments, tutoring, and “maos na massa” sessions, and other
assigned activities as best as you can. Contact your instructor if you don’t have reliable

10internet access, or if you or your partner is unable to record the conversations, so we can
find a new partner, or alternative assignments, as needed.

Recorded Conversations: In pairs (assigned by instructor) you and a classmate will
record a 5-7 minute (using zoom or skype) conversation in Portuguese. You and your
partner will receive bi-weekly prompts from the instructor (and guest facilitators) to help
guide the conversation, based on the cultural focus and socio-political issues associate
with that week’s lessons. An important goal, aside from demonstrating familiarity with
the cultural topic at hand, is to articulate your opinions in Portuguese at an Advanced
level (using ACTFL standards). See the 2 designated Fridays you will submit a video (2
in total — one for Module #1 and one for Module #2) with your partner by midnight on
Padlet. See also the 2 designated Fridays you will also submit your 2 writing assignments
(one for Module #1 and one for Module #2).

Tutoring: Each student will be assigned to a 1-hour tutoring session (in pairs) that will
meet on a weekly basis to deepen your oral proficiency and reinforce the work you are
doing in class. You will also participate in an additional, individual tutoring session for 1
hour each week.

Maos na Massa: “Maos na massa” literally means “hands in the dough.” These sessions
are intended to give you a “hand’s-on” experience making something...either Brazilian
music, food, capoeira, art, etc.... together with your peers and with the guidance of a
Portuguese speaker who is passionate about that thing. These small group sessions (of
around 4 students) are a great chance to learn something new, in a relaxed environment,
and practice your Portuguese at the same time!

Friday Rodas: A “roda” is a wheel or circle, but also conveys a gathering of friends, or
an ensemble of people making music (samba de roda) or capoeira (roda de capoeira)
together, for example. In this spirit we’ve designated the last class session on Fridays to
gather everyone for a collective activity such as a treasure hunt, talent show, debate,
special invite, or just a social “bate papo” before the weekend.

Final Oral Exam: (20%)

Final oral exams, presented in pairs during Week 7, will be given at the end of the course,
stemming from one of the cultural topics focused on throughout the course. These will be
given either during regular class online, via zoom, or by way of recorded video.

Final Paper: (20%)

A final research paper, exploring more deeply one of the topics presented in class, or
based on a topic chosen by the student (with the instructor’s input), will be submitted
approximately one week after the final in-class session.

The final grade is based on the percentage of total points earned (A = 94+, A- = 90+, B+
= 87+, B = 844, B- = 80+, C+ = 77+, C = 744, C- = 70+, D+ = 67+, D = 644, D- = 60+).
Scores are not rounded. No late work or make up work is allowed. Points are distributed
on the following basis:

1110 pts Pair Tutoring

10 pts Individual Tutoring

10 pts Maos na Massa

15 pts Video Recorded Conversations (2 times)
15 pts Written Assignments (2 times)

20 pts Final Oral Exam

20 pts Final Written Paper

100 pts TOTAL

Notes

Classroom Professionalism Policy

The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the class. Faculty are
expected to be professional and prepared to deliver value for each and every class
session. Students are expected to be professional in all respects. Because we conduct
sessions online, there are some ways that we can enhance the experience.

The classroom experience is enhanced when:

e Students arrive on time. On time arrival ensures that classes are able to start and
finish at the scheduled time. On time arrival shows respect for both fellow students
and faculty and it enhances learning by reducing avoidable distractions.

e Students minimize unscheduled personal breaks. The learning environment
improves when disruptions are limited.

e Students are fully prepared for each class. Much of the learning takes place during
online discussions. When students are not prepared they cannot contribute to the
overall learning process. This affects not only the individual, but their peers who
count on them, as well.

e Students respect the views and opinions of their colleagues. The expression and
defense of opinions are encouraged and part of the academic environment.
Intolerance for the views of others is unacceptable.

e Laptops and wireless devices are only used for course activities. In this class we
use the Internet for the delivery of almost all of our course content. However, when
students are surfing the web, responding to e-mails, instant messaging each other, etc.
they are doing a disservice to their peers and potentially causing a distraction. Restrict
use to items related to the course.

Deadlines, Missed Work & Late Work
Social Distancing and remote learning present an unprecedented situation; thus, we will
try our best to be flexible. However, you are still expected to follow class flow in order to

ensure your learning. Activities will be due at the assigned time and date. If you have
emergencies, please communicate. We understand tardiness might be the result of

12external factors. Nonetheless, continued failure to submit work on time might affect your
grade.

Students with Disabilities

Upon request, the University of Texas at Austin provides appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. Services for Students with
Disabilities (SSD) is housed in the Office of the Dean of Students, located on the fourth
floor of the Student Services Building. Information on how to register, downloadable
forms, including guidelines for documentation, accommodation request letters, and
releases of information are available online at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd/index.php. Please do not hesitate to contact SSD at
(512) 471-6259, VP: (512) 232-2937 or via e-mail if you have any questions.

Campus Carry

For those students who are 21 years of age and who legally carry a licensed and
concealed firearm, we remind you that your bags must be within arm’s reach. We also
remind you that if others see a gun, it is not legal (not concealed). FYI, Prof. Kelm’s
office has not been designated as a no-carry zone.

Senate Bill 212 and Title [IX Reporting Requirements. Under Senate Bill 212 (SB
212), the professor and TAs for this course are required to report for further investigation
any information concerning incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating
violence, and stalking committed by or against a UT student or employee. Federal law
and university policy also requires reporting incidents of sex- and gender-based
discrimination and sexual misconduct (collectively known as Title [X incidents). This
means we cannot keep confidential information about any such incidents that you share
with us. If you need to talk with someone who can maintain confidentiality, please
contact University Health Services (512-471-4955 or 512-475-6877) or the UT
Counseling and Mental Health Center (512-471-3515 or 512-471-2255). We strongly
urge you make use of these services for any needed support and that you report any Title
IX incidents to the Title IX Office.

Academic Honesty Policy - Texas

Academic dishonesty damages the reputation of the school and demeans the honest
efforts of the majority of students. The minimum penalty for an act of academic
dishonesty will be a zero for that assignment or exam.

The responsibilities for both students and faculty with regard to the Honor System are
described on https://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics. If the application of
the Honor System to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your
responsibility to ask for clarification.

13Academic Honesty Policy - Georgie

A CULTURE OF HONESTY AT UGA: PROMOTING INTEGRITY IN THE
CLASSROOM
https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/

UGA's Honor Code:"I will be academically honest in all of my academic work,
and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others."

All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of honesty and
integrity in every phase of their academic careers. The penalties for academic dishonesty
are severe and ignorance is not an acceptable defense. While the use of spell checkers in
Portuguese is encouraged, the broad use of online translation tools, copying information
from websites (without documentation), or relying on a Portuguese-speaking person to
complete your assignments for you, is not permitted. All work that you submit must be
your own.
