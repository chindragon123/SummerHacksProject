Description: This is an entry-level course in the writing of narrative fiction, with a focus on the short
story form. The first step in developing your writing craft is to learn how to read as a writer, so
substantial emphasis will be placed on reading and discussing short stories. You will be required to
analyze the structure and craft of the short stories assigned. Learning how to identify the fundamental
elements and narrative techniques in these stories will help you to employ these techniques in your own
work. We will also read several selections from the textbook discussing the craft of fiction. Class will
consist of lecture, in-class writing, discussion, and workshop participation. You should be prepared to
read and discuss your work in class. The main goal of the workshop sessions is to help you develop
editing skills so that you can continue to grow as a writer beyond this class. After your work is discussed
in workshop, you should be prepared to use the ideas discussed in the critiques to improve the original
draft. Participation in workshop is an essential part of this class, so you must come prepared to discuss
the works under consideration.

Texts: Handouts and short-stories will be provided in class. (No text needs to be purchased for class.)
