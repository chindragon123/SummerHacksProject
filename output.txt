and one of the following courses with a grade of at least c mathematics c k n r statistics and
scientific computation  this course may be used to fulfill three hours of the natural science and technology part 
or part il component of the university core curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by the texas
higher education coordinating board communication skills critical thinking skills teamwork and empirical and quantitative skills lecture instructor and course director

room via zoom lab director tim fleisher email through canvas inbox office hours m  pm course overview human microscopic
and gross anatomy bio l is an upper division lecture and lab course designed for biology and health careers majors
this course will provide studentswith an intensive survey of the microscopic and gross anatomy of various human tissues and organs
the relationship between microscopic anatomy histology and gross anatomy will be stressed the course will use a systems approach with
an emphasis on integrated structurefunction relationships at the cell tissue and organ level as well as an emphasis on clinical
applications of the material at all levels lecture and lab study will be provided online online materials will include a
virtual microscopic slide library and d computer models on completion of the course students will be able to identify and
describe the different types of human tissues the structure and location of different organs their specific functions and their relationships
with each other in the human body this semester you will have the opportunity to dive deeply into the intriguing
field of human anatomy and physiology it can be one of the most satisfying subjects you will ever study because
it brings together so much material you have learned from other courses and it can be applied to understand so
much that you encounter in your daily life you will certainly use both the facts and the skills you develop
in this course in your future careers have an open engaged mind work hard and enjoy course objectives this course
is as much about how to learn as it is about human anatomy and physiology it requires that you be
able to understand and apply the material as well as memorize it students who complete this class should be able
to  explain the inseparable relationship between microscopic and gross anatomic structure and function and be able to apply that
understanding to new situationsimages  use systematic logical thinking processes to correctly identify tissues at the microscopic level  provide
knowledge of the ultrastructure and function of the eukaryotic cell and its organelles  provide knowledge of the microscopic anatomy
and function of the four basic tissues epithelium connective tissue muscle tissue and nerve tissue  identify and describe gross
and microscopic anatomical details of the major tissues organs and organ systems of the human body  explain the functions
of the organ and the structural mechanisms that allow the organ to carry out its functions  compare and contrast
structure and function in various organ systems  use anatomical terminology of the major body regions and its cavities and
the directions and planes of section of the human body to communicate  dimensional complexity accurately and succinctly to others
in writing and in speech the following six objectives will not be directly assessed but are objectives for your course
experience and will enhance your grade organize memorize and integrate significant amounts of information ina framework that you can use
 recognize what you do not understand  improve critical reading and thinking skills  maintain composure and focus when
faced with problem solving and questions on material you have not studied directly  cooperate with classmates and work effectively
in teams  examine in detail the fascinating structure and workings of the human body learning resources class canvas site
all information pertinent to course content syllabus and course schedule announcements grades and other information will be posted on the

will be covering material that is not in the texts and will be covering material in a short amount of
time daily quizzes and attendance for class are worth  of your grade please come prepared daily by looking over
the powerpoint presentation posted in canvas andor the textbook assignment you need to be willing to ask for help when
you need it and you will need to study every day not cram at the last minute it is important
to let instructors know that you are serious about learning this can be demonstrated by questions and discussion in class
attendance and participation at office hours students who must pass bio l to qualify for graduation at the end of
the current term must contact dr babler within the first full week of the term to discuss your strategy for
success assessmentsevaluationsgrades evaluation components bio l is designed to facilitate your learning through multiple learning experiences in both lecture and
laboratory activities accordingly sixtyfive percent of your course grade will be derived from the lecture portion of the course and
thirtyfive percent will be compiled from laboratory assessments several assessmentexamination tools will be used in this course and will vary
in format from standard assessments with which you may be familiar our goal is to have you learn anatomy gross
and microscopic in a professional context that focuses on your developing ability to recall communicate and problem solve the assessment
 examination tools used in the course are explained below exams all examinations will be completed online rather than having
traditional large exams there will be five  weekly exams and four  testlet examsweekly exams will cover lecture material
from the lectures they will include factual material but also emphasize application and synthesis of material anatomical relationships physiological processes
and problem solving you may be asked to apply your knowledge in a scenario that was not specifically discussed in
class you will have  hours to complete the exam testlets testlets are clinically based scenarios that show you how
the anatomy you learn is used in dealing with clinical issues each testlet will present a patient and hisher clinical
issue you will not need to diagnosis the problem it will be given to you you will not need to
research the problem unless you want to you will be asked questions about the related anatomy for example what is
the epithelium involved or what is an important characteristic of cell in the tissue involved testlets will be made available
and reviewed on mondays in advance of the testlet exam students may take the exam any time during the week
of the testlet the exam will close on friday at noon you may not use an ipod or related device
or a cell phone during an exam we will be using the proctorio software for exam security so you will
need to ensure that the software works on your device study guides will be posted at the beginning of the
term to assist your study the exams will focus on the material presented in class and supportive powerpoints posted in
canvas quiz questions and the exam study guide will help you prepare for exams all exams will consist of only
multiple choice questions daily quizzes each class session will have a quiz covering the topic of the session each quiz
will consist of three  multiple choice questions the quiz will be in canvas and will need to be taken
prior to the next class the quiz will be open starting a  pm the night of the lecture and
close at  the next morning you may not makeup a daily quiz there will be  quizzes we will
drop the lowest three this means there will be  quiz scores used to compute your quiz grade the object
of the quiz is for you to stay up with the material the question will not be in depth but
rather it is designed to see if you are familiar with the material attendance attendance is mandatory and will be
provided through the zoom app the link to zoom will be displayed on the canvas home page each class is
worth  point for attendance we will drop two zeros ie you have up to  excused absences in the
course grading policy bio l grade distributionlecture exams   testlet exams   daily quizzes  attendance  lecture
total  lab exams   lab quizzes  lab attendance and participation  lab total  course grades cannot
be calculated until the end of the term because all test data have to be collected and entered your scores
as mentioned previously will be calculated as points earnedpoints possible x the weight of that testing item we will use
the university grading scale see attachment in the syllabus and schedule folder of canvas we do not bump scores or
add extra points at the end of the term if you have questions about your course grade please contact dr
babler before the end of the term exam conflicts students with a conflicting university class or examination must submit a
request for a different test time in writing at least one week prior to the scheduled date of the exam
the request must state the class number meeting time and professors name people taking nonut classes such as mcat prep
courses are not allowed to take early exams nor are students attending professional interviews off campus missed exams a missed
exam will be excused only if  the student can produce a verifiable written medical excuse or there has been
a verifiable death in the immediate family and  the student has contacted the instructor prior to the exam you
may email or leave a phone message as soon as you realize you must miss an exam again no makeup
exam will be given no exceptions if you have a valid excused exam your final testlet exam score will count
for the missed exam students with an excused absence for the final exam will receive an incomplete x for the
semester and will take the final exam in the next term the course is offered special accommodations the university of
texas at austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities for more information contact the office
of the dean of students at   tty in addition inform dr babler at least one week before the
first exam that you will need special accommodationsexam regrades questions about grading on the tests must be taken up with
the lab ta or the instructor no ater than  week after the test is returned be sure you have
ample justification for any regrades other than arithmetic errors the entire test will be regraded and you may lose points
as well as gain them the following policies will be in effect for all exams  only the device you
have signed on for the exam may be used no memory calculators ever no cell phones pdas or pagers computers
or other electronics all electronic devices must be turned off  noconsulation or discussion with any other persons is allowed
during the period of time that the exam is open religious holidays utaustin policy requires that you notify us at
