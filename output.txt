on the following model e after the first week students will sign up for a breakout group for each session
each breakout group has a designated meeting time during class hours these breakout groups vary in duration from  minutes
to  hour based on day and content e  will post prerecorded videos of the topics o i will
post videos for the next day by am central daylight time the day before the date listed on the schedule
o for example i will post the content planned for june  no later than june  at am e
as students i expect you to view the videos which are approximately  minutes in length before attending the breakout
group o for example i expect you to have viewed the video content for june  before we meet for
breakout groups on june  e during the breakout sessions we will use this time to review especially confusing concepts
for the smaller group helping each other understand the new material note the course grader may continue to take attendance
e on quiz days we will still meet in our breakout groups all students will take the quiz at the
same time during the scheduled class time with exact times announced later e on exam days we will not meet
in our breakout groups and all students will take the exam during the scheduled class time supplemental materials available on
canvas  certain homework solutions  lecture notes i will post electronic copies to canvas before class so you can
follow along and add your own notes during class or when you view the course videos  sample  midterm
examsacc  fundamentals of financial accounting summer  homework to supplement the assigned readings there are two types of homework
in the course solid footing homework and textbook homework solid footing homework during the first two weeks of the course
you will be learning about the accounting cycle the process with which companies capture transaction data record them summarize them
and transform them into financial statements that conform to generally accepted accounting principles gaap it is essential that every student
develop a solid understanding and ability to do accounting cycle tasks because these accomplishments are the foundation for learning the
remaining content of the course accordingly the department faculty adopted solid footing a semiinteractive tool for learning the accounting cycle
and statement of cash flows it is meant to present reinforce and test progress in the accounting cycle in a
way that leads to more consistent and deeper understanding among our students leading to less attrition and disappointing grades in
acc  to be sure that all students keep up with the lessons during this phase of the course solid
footing homework assignments must be turned in and graded although you are welcome to work on solid footing assignments with
classmates i encourage you to work through the problems individually before working together ultimately you will be tested on the
material so homework assignments are an excellent opportunity to find out what you do and do not know and to
ask questions about what you do not know the attached class schedule contains the assignments and the dates on which
they must be uploaded before the beginning of class if you need help please come see me virtually in office
hours or by appointment before the due date i will ask you to describe what you have attempted and what
the issue is and we will work together from there textbook homework i have assigned textbook homework from the chapters
we cover like the solid footing homework students should complete the textbook homework outside of class textbook homework problems are
neither submitted nor graded if you need any help please come see me the solutions for these questions will be
available on canvas quizzes during the semester there will be  quizzes administered through canvas the quiz times and windows
will be announced during class and on canvas tentative quiz dates are listed on the attached class schedule the quizzes
will be similar to homework problems and examples covered in class and are not meant to be cumulative however course
content tends to build on prior content and thus mastering the early content is critical to understanding later content there
will be no makeup quizzes however to accommodate any unforeseen circumstances during the semester i will drop your lowest quiz
score if you cannot take a quiz during the prescribed window your grade will be zero for that particular quiz
you will not be able to take a quiz at any time other than the originally planned time quizzes will
be open notes and open book but keep in mind that i have designed the quizzes with this format in
mindacc  fundamentals of financial accounting summer  the main reason for quizzes is to help you keep up with
the textbook readings course materials and homework problems quizzes also help me understand which topics are more challenging for the
class as a whole quizzes let me know if i should discuss certain concepts and areas in class again to
help improve your understanding of the material once i collect a quiz i will post solutions to canvas in addition
to spending the first  minutes of the next breakout sessions discussing the solutions after releasing your graded quiz to
you this is why i cannot allow makeup quizzes grading questions or appeals for all graded assignments except for the
final exam i will accept requests for regrades to request a regrade you must submit a written request to me
within one week from the date the grade is posted on canvas or the graded item is redistributed back to
the class whichever is earlier a copy of the graded original must accompany the request for a re grade the
request must state the area of dispute your recommendation for a change in grade and an explanation or justification for
your recommendation note that with a request for regrade i will regrade the entire assignment this means that over the
course of regrading your assignment i may encounter accidentally overlooked issues that result in a deduction of points if corrected
to maximize the accuracy of the regrade i will make all corrections required to arrive at an accurate grade for
the assignment this means that after a regrade your grade on that assignment may increase remain the same or decrease
all regrades are final office hours i highly encourage each of you to take advantage of my regularly scheduled office
hours to discuss problems and seek assistance when needed throughout the semester i would like to talk to each of
you individually at least once during the semester for  minutes if you cannot make it to my regularly scheduled
office hours please schedule an individual appointment with me in an effort to make the class as successful as possible
for all students please provide me feedback on how the course is going and how you feel you are doing
in the course i can make this class more successful if i hear from you about the parts of the
class that are working and the parts that are not working i welcome your feedback during office hours and via
email i understand that providing upward feedback can be very stressful during the semester i will also distribute anonymous surveys
for each of you to fill out and provide feedback on how the course is going personal electronic equipment policy
although i discourage the use of personal electronic devices aside from the device used to join the zoom class sessions
because they may introduce additional distractions i recognize that the most effective form of learning may differ across students just
because i found personal electronic devices not helpful for my own purposes as a student does not mean they are
not helpful for others i ask that you exercise good judgment and discretion in using additional personal electronic devicesacc 
fundamentals of financial accounting summer  zoom access policies e lam requiring you to enter the zoom meeting sessions using
your ut eid associated zoom account this will allow you to join the sessions without waiting in the waiting room
e please enter our meeting sessions with your video turned on and microphones muted e although we will adopt a
casual atmosphere in our meetings please remember this is still a professional setting and we should all conduct ourselves professionally
i reserve the right to remove students not exhibiting professional conduct from our zoom meetings course assessment semester grades will
be determined using the following factors and relative weights assignment weight number of points inclass quizzes best  out 
of  solid footing homework  final grades will be set such that the class average will be approximately 
where   b and   b no letter grades will be associated with scores on exams or quizzes
during the semester at the end of the semester i will calculate composite scores and assign grades in accordance with
the above guidelines i may curve the final grades if necessary based on the class average and the academic standards
of the course there will be no opportunity to raise your course grade through extra credit work during or after
the end of the semester while the above structure does not explicitly factor attendance in grades my experience has been
that students who attend regularly and minimize other distractions during class eg phone notifications side conversations reading the newspaper tend
to perform better than those who do not separately if you earn at least  of the   points
available for the course i will award at least a c for the course if you earn less than 
of the  points available  or below i may award an f for the course examinations there will be
three exams in this course two midterm examinations and a comprehensive final examination all three exams will be individually completed
exams administered through canvas the two midterms exam  and exam  are not cumulative however the nature of financial
accounting is such that material you learned for exam  will help with your understanding with the material for exam
 although they may not necessarily be explicitly tested the final examination will be cumulative in nature the dates for
theacc  fundamentals of financial accounting summer  exams are on the attached class schedule in life there are often
legitimate reasons a student cannot attend an examination or other important meeting at the originally scheduled times in such circumstances
you should inform me of your circumstances and i will determine if a makeup examination s appropriate if  deem
a makeup examination appropriate i will schedule the makeup exam for within  days of the original scheduled exam time
if i deem a makeup examination appropriate but i cannot schedule a makeup examination for logistical reasons only i will
reweigh your final to include the weights of both your missed exam and the final exam this policy also applies
to the final exam although i cannot reweigh final exams if i deem a makeup exam appropriate for the final
exam but i cannot schedule a makeup final within  days of the originally scheduled final we will schedule the
makeup final exam for a date prior to the originally scheduled date instructor discretion instructor discretion may include but is
not limited to announced or unannounced quizzes in or out of class quizzes on canvas participation extra homework or other
course adjustments if i choose to make such adjustment i will also post the altered course assessment incorporating the new
assignments at the time the adjustment is announced dropping the course students must go through the official procedures to drop
