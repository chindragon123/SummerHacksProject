Course Description
This course provides an introduction to individual differences focusing on various disabilities
across the age span. Course content will include definitions, legal aspects, trends and issues, and
current research related to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, learning
disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, emotional and behavioral disorders, autism
spectrum disorders, deafness and hard of hearing, blindness/low vision, multiple/severe
disabilities, and special health impairments.
Cultural Diversity in the United States
This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity courses
are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural
experience.
Course Objectives
1. Students will increase their knowledge about and sensitivity toward persons with disabilities.
2. Students will acquire a knowledge of the following concepts related to exceptionalities:
        a. Legal and theoretical definitions
        b. Prevalence and etiologies
        c. Educational and social/emotional characteristics
        d. Family involvement and dynamics
        e. Life span issues, and
        f. Assistive technology.
3. Students will gain knowledge and understanding of the socio-cultural and linguistic factors
    that influence perceptions of disability, quality of life, and services for persons with
    disabilities.
I. Course Requirements and Considerations
Required Textbook
Kauffman, J., & Hallahan, D. (2011). Handbook of Special Education. This text is available as
        an ebook through PCL
There will be additional readings and videos - and if possible agency visits.
 Class Attendance
Students are expected to attend all class sessions; however, class attendance will not be
considered in grading. You DO NOT need to inform me if you will be absent for class; however,
consistent class attendance is recommended for the following reasons:
     The reading material will be further explained in class and there will be in-class
        activities.
     In-class discussions will cover material from sources other than readings.


        Guest speakers (if possilbe) will cover selected topics from a personal/professional
         perspective.
Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class schedules. If you miss a class session or
assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day you will be given an
opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. It is the
policy of The University of Texas at Austin that you must notify each of your instructors at least
fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a religious
holy day, or on the first day of class if the religious holiday falls within the first two weeks of the
semester.
Class Participation
Each student is expected to attend each class session and to participate in class discussions and
activities. Class sessions will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, and in-class activities. In order
to effectively participate in each class session, students should complete all of the assigned
readings prior to coming to class and be prepared to discuss/apply the readings during class.
Students are also required to bring their textbook and any supplemental materials to class to
facilitate discussion and participation in class activities. Being a good participant does not
require that you address every question posed. You should, however, try to address questions or
comments, posed by the instructor and your class members on a regular basis. Your responses
should be thoughtful and always respectful of others, even when you may disagree with their
perspective.
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward
peers and community.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.

If you are suspected of academic dishonesty, I will refer your case directly to the Student Judicial
Services office.

Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities who require accommodations need to get a letter that documents the
disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of the Dean of
Students (471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). This


letter should be presented to the instructor at the beginning of the semester and accommodations
needed should be discussed at that time. See the following website for more information:
http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/
Grades –
Grades will be assigned in the following manner:
A – 90 – 100 points.
B – 80 – 89 points.
C – 70 – 79 points.
D – 60 – 69 points.
F – 59 or below.
Grades will be based on:
1. Participation/Homework                          30 points.
2. Presentation.                                   30 points.
3. Final - take home                               40 points.
Grading
1. Attendance, active participation in class, and discussion. Call, leave a message, or e-mail me before
class or as soon as possible if you have a health or other emergency. There will be homework connected
to readings and in-class assignments - homework for readings is to be written up and handed in at the end
of the class. It will be graded pass/fail and handed back to you the following class (30%).
2. Presentation – 1 presentation on topic of your choice for 20 minutes (30 pts). You can team up with
another person for this. One (1) presentation week 13 or week 15 approx. 20 minutes in length 30%
3. Final Take Home-Examination (40%). Take-home consisting of short answer questions.
         Steps for Presentation:
1. Define the problem or question of interest. (e.g., what type of reading interventions work with middle
school ELL kids? OR what effects does a father-based intervention have on family stress in parents with
kids with autism?). Define the variables of interest – which helps to identify relevant studies but also may
point out the variation in definitions used in the research.
2. Identify sources (e.g., reference databases, journals) and search terms used with reference databases to
collect articles relevant to your statement of problem or question of interest.
3. What retrieved research should be included or excluded based on suitability of research methods,
definition of variables, or participant characteristics? Which studies do you include and which do you not
include and why? List the studies you chose to include using APA format.
4. Of the studies you chose to include describe across the studies: what are the research designs, variables
and how they were implemented (IV) and measured (DV), a critique of validity issues and what are the
findings across the studies by presenting findings from each study and a summarization of findings across
studies. If using qualitative research will probably not have variables.
5. What conclusions can be drawn from the summarization of findings across the studies you chose to
include in your synthesis? Also, what issues are there: this could include a small number of studies, issues
with variable definition across studies, variation in participant characteristics across studies, limitations in
research design or validity issues, treatment or intervention integrity, omission of participant
characteristics.
6. What suggestions do you have for further research AND what implications are their for clinicians or
practitioners or teachers?
7. Have a short quiz or game at the end of the presentation for students to participate in.


Course Feedback
It is the policy of the College of Education that all organized courses be evaluated using a Course
Instructor Survey arranged through the Measurement and Evaluation Center at the end of the
semester. You will be given this course evaluation during the last week of the course. Student
evaluations remain anonymous; the instructor will not be present during the evaluation and will
not see the answer sheets until grades have been officially reported.
