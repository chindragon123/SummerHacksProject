Course Workshop Goals
   1. To help McNair Teaching Academy participants become effective leaders in the
        classroom, so they can excel as teachers at the graduate-student and professor levels.
   2. To help them learn effective teaching models, curriculum design, and pedagogy.
   3. To help them acquire skills in promoting cooperative learning and facilitating class
        discussions.
Course Practicum Goals
   1. To complement the (3) Teaching Academy workshops;
   2. To give McNair Teaching Academy participants practice in applying the Workshop
        principles through “classroom” presentations; and
   3. To give participants peer feedback on their Practicum presentations.
Course Expectations
This is a pass or fail course. To pass the course, you must do the following:
   1. Attend at least 11 out of the 14 class sessions. If you miss more than three you will fail
        the course.
   2. Be on time and participate in all class activities,
   3. Give a 30-minutes practicum. If you do not give a presentation, you will fail the course.


                                                                                                    2
Teaching Demonstration Guidelines
The purpose of the practicum is to give you practice (and feedback) in developing your own
teaching style. Here are some practicum guidelines:
       1. You should start with a freshman/introductory level concept from your own
           major/field of study. Or, you could use your SRI research.
       2. Then, ask yourself while preparing your teaching session: What do I want students
           to know and be able to do after attending my session, i.e., what will they take away?
           This is called your Teaching Objective.
       3. For example, let's say Dr. Brown was teaching a workshop on Newton's 2nd Law of
           Motion in Physics. One of his teaching objectives would be to get you to write out
           from memory the formula, F=ma, for Newton's second law. Another objective might
           be to get you to say the second law in words as "Forces cause masses to accelerate."
       4. Based on the principles presented in the Workshops:
            ~Please prepare a 25-minute “classroom” presentation in your major, at a
            freshman/introductory level (you get to choose both the format and the topic!);
            ~Deliver it to the other Teaching Academy Scholars on your assigned date;
            ~There will be a 5-minute Question/Answer/Feedback session following each
            presentation;
            ~The observing McNair Scholars must complete and submit Practicum Evaluation
            forms as feedback for each Practicum session.
            ~The McNair Scholars must answer fully all of the questions on the Practicum
            Evaluation form as part of their reflection on the session (i.e., “N/A,” “none,” or other
            variants are NOT acceptable)

        with the teaching team and with others if things start to feel out of control or
        overwhelming.

     You are responsible for creating an inclusive environment and for speaking up when


                                                                                                     3
       someone is excluded.
    You are responsible for holding yourself accountable to these standards, holding each
       other to these standards, and holding the teaching team accountable as well.
Personal Pronoun Preference
    Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and
    topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender,
    gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the
    student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or
    gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may
    make appropriate changes to my records.
University Policies
Academic Integrity
    Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor
    Code: “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core
    values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very
    seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that
    you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be
    guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of
    the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the
       University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:
    http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
 Q Drop Policy
    If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before
    the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas
    law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas
    institution. For more information, see:
    http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
 University Resources for Students
    Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we
    all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or
    exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to
    meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. There are also a range of resources
    on campus:
 Services for Students with Disabilities
    This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there
    are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have
    medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in
    case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an
    effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs
    with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If
    appropriate, also contact Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-
    866-329- 3986 (video phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
Counseling and Mental Health Center
    Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
    avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
    help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.


                                                                                                  4
     All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
     helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is
     learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
     If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings
     like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.
