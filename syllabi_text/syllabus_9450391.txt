Overview
This course examines education from a sociological perspective. We will use various theories to explore
the institution of education, going beyond our own individual experiences with education. Specific topics
include public education; stratification within and between schools; and educational reform. The primary
focus will be K-12 education in the United States.
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly
during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your
instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or
more assignments, and you will read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect
a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet
the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and
Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

                                                                          Syllabus for Sociology of Education  Page 2
Reading Assignments
Readings are assigned for most class periods. I expect you to read the assigned material prior to class.
This is an upper-division course, and requires more than a cursory read. I purposely selected a modest
number of readings because I think it is important to understand something more deeply rather than to
skim over huge quantities of material. I expect that you not only read everything, but that you also think
about how the readings complement or contradict one another. What questions occur to you as you read?
What is particularly challenging or troubling in the readings? You should come to class prepared to
participate, both in small and large groups.
Canvas
I will post various course materials and grades on this site. Check it frequently to stay informed about
your progress. I suggest setting your Notifications to ASAP for Conversations. This is how I will
communicate with you. (Go to Settings, then click Notifications, then scroll down to select the check
mark next to Conversations.)
Attendance, Participation and Classroom Etiquette:
I expect regular attendance. I will do my best to make class time informative and engaging, but as a wise
person once said, “It takes two to tango.” Our joint venture will be mutually beneficial and enjoyable
with everyone as an active participant. An active participant is someone who has read and thought about
the reading, and who comes to class ready to participate and ask questions.
Because we have all experienced education (and continue to experience!), and because the study of
education is embedded within a context of our own values and beliefs, it is possible that certain issues
will spark strong feelings and disagreements. It is important that each of us maintains respect for
opinions other than our own and practices good listening skills.
Please arrive on time to class and turn off anything that makes noise. Laptops will be useful during class
activities on particular days. Otherwise, leave them at home or in your bag so you can pay full attention.
We all create the classroom together. A large part of that happens during classroom discussions. Come
to class ready to listen attentively to your classmates, as well as participate and share your thoughts about
the readings and other class experiences.

Note: Please refer to the General Catalog for policies related to adding and dropping courses. You are
    responsible for understanding how this process works in your particular college.
Grade adjustments:
Grade adjustments MAY be made for those on the borderline between two grades. By borderline I mean
those having points that would be rounded up using normal mathematical conventions (within .5 points).
For example, a student may have points equal to 79.6%. This grade will not result in automatic “bumping
up.” In these cases I look at a variety of factors including a student’s participation and performance on
papers and exams throughout the semester.
More on grades:
If you are having trouble in the course, please come see me sooner rather than later. Sooner: there’s a
good chance we can work together to make things better. Later: there’s a good chance you will earn a
lower grade than you would have liked.
→ Please do not ask me to give you a higher grade than you earned because you are in a special honors
program, or are on academic probation or some other special circumstance.

Academic Misconduct will not be tolerated and is subject to University policies. The General Catalog of
the University of Texas states:
         "Scholastic dishonesty" includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion,
         falsifying academic records, and any act designed to give unfair academic advantage to
         the student (such as, but not limited to, submission of essentially the same written
         assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor, providing false
         or misleading information in an effort to receive a postponement or an extension on a
         test, quiz, or other assignment), or the attempt to commit such an act.
These actions may result in a zero on the particular assignment, failure of the course or expulsion from
the University. Please see the General Catalog, Sec. 11-802 for further information.
http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi01-02/app/appc11.html
All written assignments should be your own work (with the exception of group activities and projects.)
→ Proper citation of the work of others is essential in all assignments.
Accommodations:
Please see me at the beginning of the semester if you require learning or testing accommodations.
You will need a letter from the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) Office.

Religious Holidays:
Notify me of your pending absence two weeks (or as soon as possible) in advance. If you must miss a
class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will
be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
