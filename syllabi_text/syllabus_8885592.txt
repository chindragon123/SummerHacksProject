                    Course number: ADV 378S/PR 378S
Description:        This course will examine the sports industry and the business of
sports, including professional sports, the Olympic Games and college sports, as well as
agents and the empowerment of athletes. In professional sports, students will learn
about the structure and operation of teams, leagues and ownership, as well as stadiums
and arenas and methods by which they are financed. We will also discuss revenue shar-
ing and how leagues maintain competitive balance. Athlete compensation and labor is-


    sues will be examined, including unions, collective bargaining, salary caps and luxury
    taxes.
    For the Olympic Games, the class will examine the International Olympic Committee
    (“IOC”), national Olympic committees and local organizing committees, including the

    tees. Revenue generation for the Olympic Games will be covered, including media
    rights exploitation, ticket sales, sponsorship and licensing.
    In college sports, we will discuss the NCAA and its history, conferences and their
    member institutions, gender equity issues, and litigation and other challenges facing in-
    tercollegiate athletics. Students will learn about business aspects of the NCAA men’s
    basketball tournament, football bowl games and the College Football Playoff. Addi-
    tionally, some of the legal and financial challenges facing intercollegiate athletics will
    be examined.
    Lastly, the course will examine various gender, racial and ethical issues related to
    sports.
     The course will be primarily lecture and discussion of important issues in sports business
     with guest speakers who are key executives in sports and/or sports media.
     Objectives:          The student who successfully completes this course will ideally be able
                          to:
         1.    Appreciate the history of the sports industry and the impact of this history on the
               current shape of the industry.
         2.    Understand the various revenue sources of sports organizations.
         3.    Analyze the structure and economics of important current and past sports industry
               business transactions.
         4.    Recognize the important players in the sports industry and understand the motives
               for certain of their actions.
         5.    Understand the current challenges confronting the economic model of major pro-
               fessional, Olympic and college sports.
                                        COURSE OUTLINE
Approach:
This course will be comprised of twenty-eight (28) sessions (two sessions per week), including
a mid-term examination and an examination on the last day of class (December 10), with each
individual session being approximately seventy-five (75) minutes in length. There will mixture
of lecture by the principal instructor and guests, group discussion, quizzes and examinations, as
student presentations.


Class Preparation:
   1. It is expected that each student will be prepared to participate in informed and con-
        structive discussions.
   2. Reading assignments and homework must be done prior to attending class so that all
        students will benefit from an informed discussion of issues.
   3. Students will be paired during the semester into groups of two or three, and each
        group will be responsible for making a video report to the class of approximately 5-
        10 minutes in duration on a topic related to college sports media. Any written as-
        signments are to be typed. Spelling, grammar, and punctuation must conform to
        professional standards. If your presentation or assignments incorporate concepts
        that originated with others, you must acknowledge your utilization of these concepts
        pursuant to MLA citation standards.
   4. CELLPHONE AND LAPTOP USE IS NOT PERMITED IN CLASS AND ALL
        CELLPHONES AND LAPTOPS MUST BE TURNED OFF PRIOR TO CLASS.
Attendance:
   Students are expected to attend every class, which is critical to their success in the
   course and the success of the course itself. As noted below, a substantial proportion of
   each student’s grade will be attributable to in-class activities. Students should be pre-
   pared to start the class session on time. If for some reason, a student is unable to attend
   class, that student is expected to inform the GA via email prior to class. Being absent or
   late for class may result in a reduction of a student’s grade for the course. If a student
   misses a class for any reason, it is also the responsibility of the student to be informed of
   the materials covered during the class. Each student is encouraged to find a “class bud-
   dy” who can share information and assignments.
Academic Integrity and Standards:
   Students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity in
   all course activities and assignments. It is expected that there shall be no deception regard-
   ing the representation made by the student of his/her preparation, participation or perfor-
   mance.
   Plagiarism is presenting another person’s work as though it is one’s own and is a form of
   fraud. Plagiarism includes (but is not limited to) the presentation of a sequence of words
   from another writer, utilized without proper attribution. It is critical that students properly
   acknowledge the work of others and that the acknowledgement be accurate and complete.
   The remainder of the course requirements and policies relating to cheating and plagiarism
   are subject to the standard policies and procedures for all UT-Austin students as established
   by UT-Austin
   .


University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect to-
ward peers and community.
Documented Disability Statement

dations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of
the Dean of Students Services at 471-6259 or 471-6441 TTY. Also, see

Use of Canvas and I Clicker in Class
In this class I will periodically use Canvas—a Web-based course management system with
password-protected access at http://courses.utexas.edu —to distribute course materials, to
communicate and collaborate online, to post grades, to distribute assignments, and to give
students online quizzes and/or surveys. You can find support in using Canvas at the ITS
Help Desk at 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., so plan accordingly. I
Clicker is a device that may be purchased at the bookstore. It will be used in class, primari-
ly for weekly quizzes, and must be linked to Canvas. The help desk can help you with this
if you have any problem.
Feedback Statement (to encourage students to respond to requests for their
feedback)
 During this course I will be asking students to give me feedback on their learning in in-
formal as well as formal ways. It’s very important for me to know your reaction to what
we’re doing in class, so I encourage you to respond to these surveys, so that together we
can create an environment effective for teaching and learning.
Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students
Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are
responsible for reading your email for university and course-related information and an-
nouncements. You are responsible to keep the university informed about changes to your
e-mail address. You should check your e-mail regularly and frequently—I recommend dai-
ly, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related communications,
some of which may be time-critical. You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for
updating your e-mail address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days
prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an exami-
nation, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give
you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the ab-
sence.

Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble
outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the
following policies regarding evacuation:
    Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember
        that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the build-
        ing.
    If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of
        class.
    In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department,
the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office
Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic
reasons to six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:
        “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education
may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, includ-
ing any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher education,
unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
You can find advice, models, templates, and other resources for designing your course syl-
labus on the DIIA website at http://www.utexas.edu/academic/diia/
