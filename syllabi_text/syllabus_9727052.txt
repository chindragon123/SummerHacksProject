“A poem begins in delight and ends in wisdom.”—Robert Frost
Description: This class takes an ethnographic and linguistic approach to the twin and
twined concerns of speech play and verbal art. Ultimately, speech play and verbal art are
social practices that are deeply embedded within and creative of linguistic structurings
(call this grammar, if you like). After orienting students to the basic ideas of play,
grammar, performance, and context; this class proceeds to look at a variety of examples
of speech play and verbal art (from puns to lies to songs to stories to poetry) in a host of
contexts and languages. Rather than being seen as a marginal pursuit, speech play and
verbal art are revealed to be central features of the language, culture and individual
nexus and thus essential to both ethnography (anthropology) and linguistics. Along the
way, we may also find delight and wisdom in such examples of speech play and verbal
art.
Requirements: Each student will lead discussion on a reading at least twice during
the semester (this is dependent on the number of students in the class). A handout
covering the reading should be prepared by the student(s) to be given to all students
(and Professor Webster) in the class (and posted to Canvas Monday night). Each
student not presenting that week will turn in a set of weekly questions on the assigned
readings for that week. These weekly questions should be posted to the class on Canvas
by Monday night (so that they are available before class Tuesday morning). There
should be at least 1 (one) question per reading. The questions can range from the
informational to the more theoretical. These questions compose part of the 10% of your
grade regarding participation.
There is one book review (15% each). This should be from 5-7 pages and should both
describe and evaluate the work. Comparisons with class readings when relevant may
also be included.
A final paper, on a topic to be agreed upon with the instructor, is due Dec 5th. The
paper should be between 13-20 pages (30%). Each student will give a presentation on
the topic of their research during the last two/three weeks of the semester (15%). The
order will be determined later in the semester. By Oct. 10, you should have discussed a
paper topic with Dr. Webster.
I will not accept late assignments. Please do not ask. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.

All classes—like life—are works in progress, and, if the need arises, the current plans and
objectives may need to be changed to enhance the learning opportunities in the class.
This is to be expected and such changes will be clearly communicated.

Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside
