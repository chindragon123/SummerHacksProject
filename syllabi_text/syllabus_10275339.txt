[...] the entry point to the present necessarily takes
the form of an archaeology that does not, however,
regress to a historical past but returns to that part
within the present that we are absolutely incapa-
ble of living [...] The attention to this “unlived”
is the life of the contemporary. And to be contem-
porary means in this sense to return to a present
where we have never been.1

For the Better. A history of space is inevitably tied to

Schedule      Unless otherwise announced, this course
              is conducted on Tuesdays from 5:00
              PM to 8:00 PM in BTL 101. Attendance,
              active participation in discussions,
              presentation in class, the submission of
              assignments, a seminar-related record
              of digital notecards, as well as the
              timely submission of the final project
              are required. For each class theme and
              required readings please refer to the
              seminar schedule in pages 10-11.
Participation Participation is a significant portion of
              the final grade and is key to develop
              the ability to articulate ideas, and form
              positions. It is expected that every
              student will speak during each class
              discussion.

              that will build the seminar’s glossary.  At                morning before class.
              Readings
              Students are expected to prepare for
              each week by completing the assigned
              reading and to come to class prepared.
              Active participation in the seminar is
              essential for success in this class. All
              readings are available via Canvas. Please
              note that some of the PDF’s are quite
              large. Allow ample time for downloading
              them.
              Note: Keep in mind that readings, glossary words, and the case studies will constitute the foundation of our
              class discussions. 30% of the final grade is given to participation during class.
