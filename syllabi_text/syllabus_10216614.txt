I.           Rationale:
AET 341c is a lecture/lab course designed to introduce students to the concepts and current trends of the
use of virtual instruments. Looking closely at programs such as Kontakt, Absynth, Reaktor, Battery and
more, students will learn how to “orchestrate” musical ideas. Students who successfully complete the
course will be skilled in using virtual instruments to produce and arrange in a variety of contemporary
musical settings.
II.      Course Aims and Objectives:
By the end of this course, students will:
             o     Acquire a working knowledge of a variety virtual instruments and how best to use the effectively
             o     Think critically about how and why to use certain instruments to achieve your musical goals
             o     Understand how to arrange a complex composition from minimal MIDI data.
             o     Understand how to make your own custom instruments for use across multiple projects and
                   production settings
             o     Understand how to best use virtual instruments to produce in a variety of different musical and
                   genre settings.

III. My Assumptions
                I come to the teaching of this course with the assumption that you have varied musical
                background. Thus, there are no pre-requisites in music theory or composition. The nature of the
                coursework is such that the student, with no musical skill, can find his/her voice through the aid of
                the digital audio workstation and copious examples of electronic music composition and music
                software.
                It has been my longstanding belief that, with the certain alignment of circumstances, creativity and
                artistic discernment can be taught. It has been my experience with the teaching of this course that
                students with little to no prior music experience stand to gain much knowledge from fellow
                classmates with some musical skill. I have found the opposite to be true: that students with musical
                experience learn A LOT from the outside-the-box perspective brought by in the inexperienced. I
                will work hard to keep this dynamic alive throughout the term.
IV. Course Requirements:
        1. Class attendance and participation policy:
                (a) Expected classroom behavior (may want to develop this with the students, e.g., What
                guidelines are appropriate for behavior and participation in a large class? [See last page of this
                handout for a sample.]
                (b) Ground Rules for participation in discussions or activities
                (c) Civility statement and code of conduct
                                                         2


AET 341C Course Syllabus
                 Religious Holy Days
                 By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
                 the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
                 assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to
                 complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
       2. Course Readings/Materials:
                 I will post reading materials as necessary
                 Supplies needed:
                 One minimum 8gb flash drive
       3. Assignments, Assessment, and Evaluation
                 Regular and punctual attendance at all classes is required. Absences of each student are recorded
                 without exception from the official date of her/his enrollment. The counting of absences begins
                 on the first day of a student’s enrollment in the course after classes begin.
                 Both tardiness and early departure from class are forms of absenteeism. If you are more than 20
                 minutes late, this constitutes an absence. Lesser tardiness will affect your class participation grade
                 for that day. Students are expected to be in class the entire class period and actively engaged in
                 classroom activities at all times. Absences from the room in either body or spirit will negatively
                 affect your grade.
       4. Use of Canvas in class
               In this class I use Canvas—a Web-based course management system with password-protected
               access at http://courses.utexas.edu —to distribute course materials, to communicate and
               collaborate online, to post grades, to submit assignments.
VI. Grading Procedures: Grades will be based on:
       1. Instrument Projects                                           30% total
       2. 4 Arrangement/Orchestration Projects (7.5% each)              30%
       3. Final Project                                                 30%
       4. Class Participation/Discussion/Attendance                     10%
        Letter Grade Policy:
        To ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B-
        will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999... The University does not recognize the grade of
        A+. Thus, the conversion from percentage value to letter grade is as follows:
        A = 94 – 100
        A- = 90 – 93.999…
                                                         3


AET 341C Course Syllabus
           B+ = 87 – 89.999…
           B = 84 – 86.999…
           B- = 80 – 83.999…
           C+ = 77 – 79.999…
           C = 74 – 76.999…
           C- = 70 – 73.999…
           D+ = 67 – 69.999…
           D = 64 – 66.999…
           D- = 60 – 63.999…
           F = 0 – 59.999…
VII. Academic Integrity

Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six (6). As
stated in Senate Bill 1231:
          “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit an
   undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has
   dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than
   that number.”
Emergency Evacuation Policy
 Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm
 is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
          ▪ Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest
              exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
          ▪ If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
          ▪ In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police
Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
