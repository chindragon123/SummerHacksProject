• Text: Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, 4th Edition by Anthony
  J. Hayter (Cengage Learning).
• Computational Tools: We will be using Microsoft Excel.
• Grading Policy: Homework is worth 25% of your grade. Each exam is weighted
  equally and is worth 25% of your grade.
• Exams:
     – Midterm #1, July 25th, first part of class.
     – Midterm #2, August 6th, first part of class.
     – The final exam will take place at the university scheduled time.
    1. You are required to take all exams to pass the class. No early exams will be given.
        Make-up exams will not be given without a valid medical excuse.
    2. The final exam will will focus on material given in the latter part of the semester.
        You will be given an outline of exam topics before each exam.
                                             1


     3. For all exams you will be allowed one standard-sized (8.5in by 11in) hand written
        cheat sheet. You may write on both sides.
     4. If you request a regrade of a problem on an exam, I reserve the right to regrade
        the entire exam (possibility resulting in a lower overall score). So, I suggest only
        requesting a regrade if I made a blatant grading error.
• Academic Integrity: Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty
  are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and
  dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, fellow students,
  and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
  enforced.
  Guidance on Homework Policy: You may discuss the homework problems with your
  fellow classmates. However, you must write up and understand your solutions individ-
  ually. If I suspect you have used someone else’s homework solutions to an unreasonable
  extent, you will be asked to come to my office to give me a detailed explanation of
  your solutions. If you cannot explain what you wrote down adequately, you will not
  receive credit for that homework.
• Prerequisites: M408D, with a grade of at least C, and admission to an appropriate
  major sequence in engineering.
• Students with disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request
  appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For
  more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641
  TTY.
• Course Evaluation: Near the end of the course you will have an opportunity to
  anonymously evaluate the course and instructor using the standard College of Engi-
  neering evaluation form.
• Class Web Site and Privacy: For this class, a web-based, password-protected class
  site will be available via the Canvas system. The syllabus, handouts, assignments and
  other resources are types of information that may be available within this site. Site
  activities could include exchanging e-mail, engaging in class discussions and chats, and
  exchanging files. In addition, a class e-mail roster will be a component of the site.
  Students who do not want their names included in this electronic class roster must
  restrict their directory information in the Office of the Registrar, Main Building, Room
  1. For more information on restricting directory information see the undergraduate
  course catalog.

• Course Goals: To develop a thorough understanding of the methods of probability
  and statistics which are used to model engineering problems and develop the neces-
  sary skills to implement and analyze basic statistical models using computer software
  packages.
• Knowledge, Abilities, and Skills students should have before entering this
  course: familiarity with multivariate integral and differential calculus, sums and series,
  basic knowledge of the Excel spreadsheet software.
• Knowledge, Abilities, and Skills students should gain from this course: abil-
  ity to model and analyze engineering problems involving random factors, including:
  calculating probabilities, expectation, variance, correlation, modeling using appropri-
  ate random variables; ability to model problems using simple statistical methods, in-
  cluding: awareness of situations in which statistical methods are valid, assumptions
  used in basic statistical models, construction of confidence intervals for one and two
  sample data problems, formulation and analysis of hypothesis tests, ability to do sim-
  ple linear regression analysis (predictions on the regression line, correlation analysis,
  residual analysis).
• Impact on Subsequent Courses in Curriculum: improved ability to analyze
  and properly interpret data collected in engineering testing, better understanding of
  random factors in engineering experiments.

                                      General Comments
    1. If you find yourself falling behind in class, please come by and see me. It is very
       important not to get confused early on, since each new topic builds upon the previous
       topics.
    2. The only to learn probability and statistics is to do lots of problems. This course will
       likely be different than previous courses you have had in many respects. In particular,
       you may understand both the lectures and the book quite well, but may not be able
       to do the homework problems efficiently.
    3. Attendance is not compulsory. However, you are responsible for keeping up with any
       lecture material you have missed. All homework assignments will be posted on the
       web on the day they are handed out in class. Any slides I use in class will be posted on
       the web the day they are used in class. However, the slides usually not have sufficient
       detail for you to recover the lecture and not all lectures will be given from slides.
                                      Course Outline
     Provided below is a rough outline of the topics of the course. The order and number of
lectures may change during the semester, depending on time. In parenthesis are the related
sections in the Hayter textbook which is related to each lecture topic.
