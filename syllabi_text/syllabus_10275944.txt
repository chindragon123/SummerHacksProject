Course Description:
This course is an introduction to the anthropological study of social and cultural
phenomena. It aims at communicating basic thoughts, concepts, and theories that are part
of the sub-discipline of cultural anthropology and part of the larger tradition of social
sciences. Based on the required readings, students will be exposed to the ways in which
these concepts and theories are applied to the study of contemporary groups of people.
Next to discussing some of the important debates in current qualitative social science, we
will critically examine a variety of texts, including three ethnographic studies of three
different cultures, in order to understand some of the differences and commonalities of
human experience.

This course satisfies the Global Cultures Flag and it may be used to fulfill the Social and
Behavioral Sciences Component of the university core curriculum. It addresses the
following core objectives established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board:
communication skills, critical thinking skills, and social responsibility.
Course Requirements for Registered Students:
In combination with the TA-led discussion sections, the lecture class relies on the
intellectual commitment and active participation of all students. In order for the lectures
to be effective, all students must have the reading assignments completed and ready
for in-depth discussion before each meeting.
Attendance is required, and so is active participation in the discussion section. Students
are encouraged to ask questions and contribute to the discussion in both the section
meetings as well as during the lectures. You must come to class having carefully read all
materials and be prepared to discuss, question, and argue about issues raised in the
readings. It will be beneficial for you to take excerpts/notes on any material that you find
enlightening, controversial, or objectionable. You should also take notes in class on
themes, key terms, and debates we discuss. These note-taking strategies will be crucial
when you study for your exams.
                     The use of computers and other electronic devices
           for purposes other than those related to this class is not permitted.
                                                                                            3


In short:
     -   Attend all classes (lectures and discussion sections). Attendance will be taken!
     -   Do all assigned readings (while taking excerpts/notes!) by the respective dates
         indicated on the syllabus and participate actively in the discussion sections.
     -   Two written Blue-Book Exams on Monday, February 10th and, the Final on
         Wednesday, May 6th to be taken during the lecture class and covering a
         theoretical question based on the assigned readings. All students are
         responsible to bring their own blue book! THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP EXAMS!
     -   Two Take-Home Exams to be handed in to the TAs during the lecture class on
         Monday, March 9th and Monday, April 6th [exactly 3-pages (double-spaced/12
         point/Calibri)] (assignment will be posted on Canvas the Wednesday [after class]
         before it is due).
The two blue-book exams and two take-home exams are designed to develop critical
reading, analytical, and writing skills. Evaluation criteria include, but are not limited to,
critical and integrative analysis of texts, clarity of thought, ability to synthesize readings
and class discussions into your own argument, and ability to formulate a theoretical
grounding for it. A visit to the Undergraduate Writing Center in The Perry-Castaneda
Library, 101 E 21st St #2.330 is highly encouraged. Students who consult with the UWC
and have the Instructor/TAs notified will receive an additional point on their Take-
Home Exam. For the in-class exams, make sure your handwriting is legible!

According to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, to “plagiarize” means
    • to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own.
    • to use (another's production) without crediting the source.
    • to commit literary theft.
    • to present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing
        source.
In other words, plagiarism is an act of fraud. It involves both stealing someone else's
work and lying about it afterward.
All of the following are considered plagiarism:
    •   turning in someone else’s work as your own.
    •   copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit.
    •   failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
    •   giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation.
    •   changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving
        credit.
    •   copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of
        your work, whether you give credit or not (see our section on “fair use” rules).
Most cases of plagiarism can be avoided, however, by citing sources. Simply
acknowledging that certain materials have been borrowed and providing your readers
with the information necessary to find that source is usually enough to prevent
plagiarism.
