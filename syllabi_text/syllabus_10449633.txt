Course Description | Descrizione del corso
This course is conducted in Italian.
The goals of this course are to improve students’ skills in writing, speaking and reading
in Italian, as well as to increase their level of comprehension (both reading and
listening). We will be studying the last two chapters of Piazza (same textbook as for ITL
611C), review grammatical structures expanding on the more complex ones.
Furthermore, we aim at expanding the students’ knowledge of Italian culture through
the use of educational videos and live interaction with Italians. We will reach these goals
by:
a. Reading short stories, fairy tales, articles
b. Reviewing grammatical structures
c. Listening to a variety of audio material, watching videos and three movies
d. Talking with Italians –Talk Abroad- four times during the semester
Free online resources that we will use in this class:
ITAL--Educational Videos and more: https://www.italchannel.tv/home
Radio Arlecchino, Italian Grammar and Culture Podcast--read grammatical
explanations in the pdf files; feel free to listen to the podcasts and read the culture notes:
https://coerll.utexas.edu/ra/index.php
This course is divided into three parts; each part is devoted to a cultural theme and
includes a movie. Specific grammatical structures will be reviewed/studied in each part.
Part I: Politics, Society, Current events; Part II: Fairy Tales; Part III: Italy & Texas.
The success of this course relies heavily on a learning environment that is welcoming to
all people. Each one of us will work hard to establish a strong sense of community based
upon respect, collaboration, and freedom of opinion and expression.
Class meetings-- We will meet via Zoom MTWTh. Except for the first one (June 5),
on Fridays, we will not have a Zoom meeting; instead, you will conduct online activities
watching ITAL educational videos, movies and interacting via Skype with Italians
through Talk Abroad. You will have until Sunday night (or Monday before 2:00p.m.)
to complete assignments on these online activities.
Office hours-- Please let me know if you need/want to talk to me outside of class: I will
gladly make an appointment with you. We can talk via email
adolson@austin.utexas.edu, phone 512-826-0992, and Zoom. I will work individually
                                                                                            1


with each one of you on any aspect of the material covered in class or just to have a

each one of you outside the class and having the chance to get to know you better.

                     Academic Guidelines and Resources
•   Title IX, a segment of the Education Amendments of 1972, makes it clear that
    violence, harassment, or discrimination based on sex and gender are Civil Rights
    offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of
    support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race,
    national origin, etc. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted,
    you can find the appropriate resources at https://www.utexas.edu/student-
    affairs/policies/title-ix
•   Counseling and Mental Health Center: As a student, you may experience a
    range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained
    relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty
    concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or
    stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your
    ability to participate in daily activities. Services are available here at UT, and
    treatment does work. The UT Counseling and Mental Health Center
                                                                                          8


         (http://chmc.utexas.edu/) provides counseling, psychiatric, consultation, and
         prevention services that facilitate students' academic and life goals and enhance
         their personal growth and well-being. The CMHC crisis line is available
         24/7/365 at 512-471-2255. A wonderful resource at the CMHC is the MindBody
         Lab, a self-paced environment designed to help UT students explore various
         resources for improving their emotional and physical health. The Lab currently
         features audio and video instruction on a variety of topics, including sleep
         issues; food and body image; health and well being; relaxation and meditation.
         Most of this material is experiential, enabling students to follow along and
         practice the skills as they are being discussed.
    •    Writing Center: the teaching team strongly encourages you to consult the
         University Writing Center (UWC) - PCL 2.330, 471-6222, uwc.utexas.edu).
         Appointments are available for all UT students at uwc.utexas.edu/appointments
         or by calling the UWC Front Desk at 512-471-6222.
    •    The Sanger Learning Center. Did you know that more than one-third of UT
         undergraduate students use the Sanger Learning Center each year to improve
         their academic performance? All students are welcome to take advantage
         of Sanger Center’s classes and workshops, private learning specialist
         appointments, peer academic coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses in
         15 different subject areas. For more information, please
         visit http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/slc or call 512-471-3614 (JES A332).

University of Texas Honor Code. The core values of The University of Texas at Austin
are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility.
Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity,
honesty,      trust,   fairness,    and     respect   toward    peers     and    community.

Documented Disability Statement. The University of Texas at Austin provides upon
request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities.
For more information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities from the Division
of Diversity and Community Engagement at 471-6259 (voice) or 232-2937 (video phone)
or http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd
Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students. E-mail is recognized as an
official mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are responsible for reading
your e-mail for university and course-related information and announcements. You are
responsible to keep the university informed about changes to your e-mail address. You
should check your e-mail regularly and frequently—I recommend daily, but at
minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related communications, some
of which may be time-critical. You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for
updating your e-mail address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php
Religious Holy Days. A student shall be excused from attending classes or other required
activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including
travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may
not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete
an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the
absence. University policy requires students to notify each of their instructors as far in
advance of the absence as possible so that arrangements can be made.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL). If you are worried about someone who is
acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone
                                                                                           9


your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a
partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental
Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of
Texas         Police        Department             (UTPD).          Call        512-232-5050           or   visit
http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal
Academic Dishonesty. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty
are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course
and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all
students and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be
strictly enforced. The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning,
discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each
member of the University is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty,
trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community. For further information, please
visit http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis.php
Emergency Evacuation Policy. Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are
required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an
announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember
that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building. If
you require assistance to evacuate, inform your instructor in writing during the first
week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class
instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin
Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services
office. Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency
procedures can be found at: http://www.utexas.edu/safety/preparedness/ For an
emergency either on or off campus call 911.
Q drop Policy. The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course
drops for academic reasons to six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231: “Beginning with
the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit an
undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course
a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher education, unless
the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
