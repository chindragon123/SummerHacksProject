I. COURSE DESCRIPTION
What role does the past play in current societal debates and politics in Germany and the
United States? This course addresses this question by engaging with key theoretical and
empirical debates from the burgeoning research field of politics of the past. We will look at
the role that memories play in Germany and the US today from a comparative perspective,
and we will ask questions such as: how has memory been defined since the 20th century by
European and American scholars? Is remembering important or even essential for societies,
and if so, why? What different roles do forms of remembrance such as individual memory,
generational memory, museums, monuments play in our societies? How do narratives of the
past reproduce or challenge contemporary power relations, and to what extent do political
actors and institutions construct particular historical narratives that serve their current
interests?
II. COURSE OBJECTIVES
The course aims to enable students to understand central theories and concepts of memory
studies, and to apply them in an empirical case study on the role and the use of the past in
current politics. At the end of the course, students will have a thorough theoretical and
empirical understanding on the ways in which memory and politics intersect both as research
fields and as political practices in contemporary societies. Students will also be able to
                                                                                            1


independently design a case study, to identify a relevant central research question and to carry
out an empirical investigation.
III. COURSE MATERIALS
Readings for each class meeting are on canvas. For your case study you will be asked to
research additional literature. Our Canvas site is accessible to each of you at
https://courses.utexas.edu or through your UT Direct account. E-mail reminders and updates
will be send through Canvas.
IV. GRADING AND ASSIGNMENTS
 Students will be graded on a 100-point scale which includes + and -:
 A      100 %        to 93.0%
 A-     < 93.0 %     to 90.0%
 B+     < 90.0 %     to 87.0%
 B      < 87.0 %     to 83.0%
 B-     < 83.0 %     to 80.0%
 C+     < 80.0 %     to 77.0%
 C      < 77.0 %     to 73.0%
 C-     < 73.0 %     to 70.0%
 D+     < 70.0 %     to 67.0%
 D      < 67.0 %     to 63.0%
 D-     < 63.0 %     to 60.0%
 F      < 60.0 %     to 0.0%
Every student will moderate the discussion of a text, participate in a working group for the
symposium on the fall of the Berlin wall and carry out an empirical case study on a memory
issue or controversy in Germany or the US. The case study consists of an oral presentation
and a final paper. Your grade will be determined based on the following:
                                                                                               2


Moderator/discussion leader: 20 percent
Symposium working group and 500 words brief: 20 percent
Oral presentation:                20 percent
Final paper:                      30 percent
Participation:                    10 percent
1. Moderator/discussion leader
Teams of students will be assigned to moderate the discussion on one of the theoretical texts
of the course. These moderators/discussion leaders will prepare a short introduction to the
text (10 minutes, informal oral presentation) and a handout with questions for the class. The
handout will be uploaded on canvas two days before the class meeting. Questions should be
about the content of the reading but they should also be thought provoking, and encourage a
discussion on how the text is helpful for better understanding processes of memory and how
it might be used to come up with research questions and case studies.
2. Symposium working group and symposium brief
Every student will participate in a working group for the symposium “Cultures of the wall”
(24/25 October 2019). Working groups will be assigned in class. Every student is expected to
write a 500 words (=+/-10 percent) summary (“brief”) on his/her activities and research in
the working group.
3. Oral presentation (20 minutes)
Presentation of your case study. Please come and see me during office hours at least one
week before your presentation.
4. Final paper (2500 words)
Written summary of your case study. The paper should be roughly structured as follows:
Introduction (outline the relevance of the topic and your central question)
Theoretical/conceptual framework
Analysis/empirical part
Conclusion
References (minimum 4 scholarly sources)
We will talk in class about how to write a research paper.
5. Participation
Actively participating in class, posting on discussion threads, presenting homework, sharing
ideas and questions.
                                                                                             3

VI. OTHER INFORMATION
Religious Holy Days and other absences
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior
to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a
work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
The same applies to official university obligations like Club or Varsity sports.
Attendance policy
You are allowed four unexcused absences during the semester. Any additional absence will
lead to a reduction of your participation grade by half a point.
If you miss classes more than twice due to medical reasons, please provide documentation
from a physician.
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you will need to execute a Q drop before
the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas
law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution.
