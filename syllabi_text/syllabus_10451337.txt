HDF 113L Course Description
HDF 113L provides students with the opportunity to observe children’s developmental characteristics,
and relate observations to the issues discussed in related coursework.
What you will learn in HDF113L
       - You will develop skills to carefully collect accurate and objective observational data.
       - You will be able to interpret observational data, applying theories and methodologies of
                  human developmental science.
                         Welcome to HDF313 and HDF 113L Summer Semester 2020
Why do you belong here?
         Because you want to be the best therapist, counselor, advocate, teacher, health professional.
               You will achieve excellence in your field through a better understanding of your client.
         Because you want to contribute to the greater social good.
                      How can we make the next generation better than we are? Having a deeper
                      understanding of human similarities (genetic) and individual differences (experiences)
                      at different ages will allow you to participate in improving the lives of the humans of
                      this planet.
         Because you want to create healthy relationships in your own life.
                      Through awareness of the impact of experience, greater understanding,
                      acceptance, and compassion can be built between you and others.
         Because you want to understand yourself, who you are and where you are, on this developmental
         journey.
                      “If you don’t know where you’ve been, you don’t know where you’re going.”
                      Through self-awareness, we can identify how to nurture ourselves in all areas of
                      development, as well as ways to engage in creative acts and communication.
         Because you are curious.
                      You are enrolled in an academic institution of learning.
                      To be a student is to be immersed in the pursuit of asking questions and gaining
                      understanding.
                                                University Policies
       1.      Academic integrity: Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of
       Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core
       values of the University, and uphold academic integrity.” Academic dishonesty includes, but is not
       limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, and falsifying academic records or the attempt to do
       these things. Cheating on exams includes: a) copying from another student’s exam, b)
       possessing or using materials during an exam that are not authorized, c) using, buying, stealing,
       transporting, or soliciting an exam or exam key, d) collaborating with another student during an

exam, and/or e) permitting someone to take an exam for you. Violation of this policy will result in
disciplinary action, which may include failure of the course or dismissal from the University. See
University Honor Code of Conduct: https://catalog.utexas.edu/general-
information/theuniversity/#universitycode
2. Incompletes: Incompletes will not be given except in emergency situations, e.g., a serious
illness or a death in the family. To claim an emergency situation you must:
 1) notify the instructor by phone or email before the last day of class AND
 2) provide documentation of the emergency.
 If you have missed any assignments , and you have not made arrangements with me, when it is
 time to calculate grades, your grade will be calculated accordingly.
 3. Disabilities: This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and
 abilities. Please notify me of any disabilities that you might have, that will require a
 modification or adaptation of the course, so that you can be successful. You will be asked to
 provide documentation to the Dean of Students’ office, which will then inform me of the
 specific accommodations needed. The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request,
 appropriate accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information,
 contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259; 471-4641 TTY.
  4. Your Rights and Responsibilities
  •      You have a right to a learning environment that supports mental and physical wellness.
  •      You have a right to respect.
  •      You have a right to be assessed and graded fairly.
  •      You have a right to freedom of opinion and expression.
  •      You have a right to privacy and confidentiality.
  •      You have a right to meaningful and equal participation, to self-organize groups to
  improve your learning environment.
  •      You have a right to learn in an environment that is welcoming to all people. No student
         shall be isolated, excluded or diminished in any way.
  With these rights come responsibilities:
  •       You are responsible for taking care of yourself, managing your time, and
          communicating with the teaching team and with others if things start to feel out of
          control or overwhelming.
  •       You are responsible for acting in a way that is worthy of respect and always respectful
          of others. Your experience with this course is directly related to the quality of the
          energy that you bring to it, and your energy shapes the quality of your peers’
          experiences.
  •       You are responsible for creating an inclusive environment and for speaking up when
          someone is excluded.
  •       You are responsible for holding yourself accountable to these standards, holding each
          other to these standards, and holding the teaching team accountable as well.
    5. Personal Pronoun Use (She / He / They / Ze / Etc)
    Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals
    and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation,
                                                                                                  3


gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with
the student’s legal name, unless they have added a “preferred name” with the Gender and
Sexuality Center (http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-
resources/). I will gladly honor your request to address you by your preferred name and
preferred gender pronouns (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in
the semester so that I may make appropriate updates to my records.
                           University Resources for Students
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve
your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are
not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the
college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is
most helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or
feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.
http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html
In addition, please DO NOT hesitate to contact the office of the Dean of Students if you ever
have personal situations that impact your ability to meet your academic responsibilities. The
Dean will notify your professors. http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/
BeVocal:
BeVocal is a university-wide initiative to promote the idea that individual Longhorns have the
power to prevent high-risk behavior and harm. At UT Austin all Longhorns have the power to
intervene and reduce harm. To learn more about BeVocal and how you can help to build a
culture of care on campus, go to: wellnessnetwork.utexas.edu/BeVocal.
Important Safety Information:
If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs or Professors,
call BCAL (the Behavior Concerns Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be
anonymous. If something doesn’t feel right – it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and
share your concerns.
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at
federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and
working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct
occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm
or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
“Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to
the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related
                                                                                               4


incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or
with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether
they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or
remedies without making an official report to the university, email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and resources,
visit or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.

 Classroom expectations.
      The same expectations as listed for HDF 313. (see above.)
 HDF113L meetings: Every Monday beginning 6/8 through 7/6, there will be a Zoom Lab meeting
 1:00-2:30. Readings will be posted periodically to help you prepare for the lab meetings
 HDF 113L homework assignments: every Monday, homework will be assigned. This homework
 is due on Canvas by Thursday at midnight that same week. (All lab readings, meetings, and
 homework are highlighted in yellow on the course and lab calendars.)
 See grading policies and point values below. Final grades in the course or lab that end in.5,
 for example 89.5, will be rounded up. So, in the case of the example, 89.5 would be reported
 as an A-. Final grades ae calculated as a sum of all of your assignments, not an average.
 Grades in the course are calculated and reported separately from your lab grade; your grade
 in HDF 313 does not affect you grade in HDF 113L, or visa versa.
