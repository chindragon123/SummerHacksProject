This course carries the following flags: Cultural Diversity in the United States (CD). The Center for the Core
Curriculum describes this flag as follows:
CD: “Cultural Diversity courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the
American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from
assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one U.S. cultural group that has experienced
persistent marginalization.”
