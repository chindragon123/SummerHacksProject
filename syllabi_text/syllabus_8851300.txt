Canvas and readings
   There is no textbook for this course. However, I have assembled a packet of required
   readings (articles) for purchase at the McCombs Copy Center (GSB 3.136). For your
   convenience, I will make all readings available on Canvas (http://canvas.utexas.edu), but I
   strongly encourage you to buy the packet rather than download and print everything from
   Canvas. I also use Canvas to post assignments and announcements, so please monitor the
   course Canvas site on a regular basis. I cannot be responsible for information that students
   miss even though it is posted prominently on Canvas.
   Please feel free to post questions or comments (or reply to others’ questions or comments) in
   the discussion board area of Canvas. I will reply to any reasonable question that does not get
   a reply from a fellow student before I get to it. Hence, if you have a question of general
   interest, please use the Canvas discussion board, not email. That way everyone benefits.
   All written assignments must be submitted electronically to Canvas no later than
   10:45 a.m. on the assignment due date. The intent of this rule is to remove any incentive to
   complete the assignment after it is discussed in class. In addition, students are responsible
   for printing and handing in a hard-copy of each assignment in class on the due date.
   Failure to abide by these rules will result in a penalty to be determined by the instructor on a
   case-by-case basis.

Course Objectives
At the end of the semester, you should be able to provide reasonable answers to the following
questions:
1. How can the scientific method be used to address important accounting questions?
2. What is the difference between the kind of accounting research that is typically done in
     practice and the kind of accounting research that is typically done in universities?
3. What is the relevance of scientific-method accounting research to accounting practitioners and
     policymakers?
4. What is the relevance of scientific-method accounting research to accounting education and
     teaching?
5. What is research validity and what makes a study believable?
6. What is an interaction?
7. How do ethical principles bear upon sound research?
8. What examples of scientific-method accounting research are at the cutting edge in financial
     accounting, auditing, management accounting, and taxation?
9. What are the biggest needs for future accounting research?
10. At a basic level, how does one go about conducting an accounting research study?
Overview of Course Plan
    • We will cover objectives 1-7 in a traditional class format in the first month, but with
        ample opportunity for discussion. An examination over this material on Wednesday,
        September 26 will be the only examination in this course.
    • After the exam on September 26, the remainder of the semester will be dedicated to
        course objectives 8 and 9, with an article each Monday to illustrate that week’s theme,
        followed by student discussion on Wednesday to identify opportunities for future
        research.
    • Objective 10 (conducting research) will be covered by a research assignment involving an
        archival database and statistical testing, following instructions I will distribute later in the
        semester. It is due on the last day of class, December 10. This assignment serves in lieu
        of a final exam.

Evaluated Components and Grades
Your accountability for this course will be based on a 800-point scale, as follows:
                                                                      Points         Percentage of

    Research proposal 1 (see description later)                        100               12.5%

    Weekly article quizzes                                             160               20.0%
    End-of-semester research project                                   120               15.0%
    Class participation                                                160               20.0%
      Total points possible                                            800              100.0%
I do not establish point cutoffs for letter grades until the end of the semester, although I start by
considering the traditional 90% = “A”; 80% = “B” guidelines, with +/- grades awarded around
the borderlines -- particularly the A/B borderline. Depending on the overall point distribution at
the end of the semester, I reserve the right to use cutoffs that are more generous than the
traditional guidelines. Students should not count on this possibility, however, as my hope is that
it will not be necessary. My intent is to establish an overall grade-point average for this course
between 3.4 and 3.6 (where “A” = 4.0), consistent with guidance from the Department of
Accounting MPA Program Office regarding the expected grade distribution for a graduate-level
accounting elective.
While I expect to award several “A” and “A-” grades for a graduate-level elective in a program
as strong as ours, I also interpret such grades as exceptional performance. Thus, students who
meet but do not necessarily exceed my basic expectations for this course will typically receive a
“B+” or “B.” Grades of “B-” or worse in a graduate-level course are appropriate when a student
has not met expectations. My overall “expectation benchmark” is around 80% of the available
points, so to avoid a B- or worse, aim for at least 640 points. Please also note that severe
academic penalties, up to a failing grade in the course, can result from cases of scholastic
dishonesty.


ACC 380K.22 SYLLABUS (KACHELMEIER)                                                                    4
FALL 2018
Plus/Minus Grading
I award +/- grades in an approximately “GPA neutral” manner. This means that I award plus or
minus grades for borderline cases (primarily at the A/B cutoff) in a way that does not
significantly alter the grade-point average for the class as a whole. Thus, the number of students
who get an A- instead of an A will be about the same as the number who get a B+ instead of a B.
Plus-minus grading simply allows a finer distinction between different levels of performance.
Descriptions of Evaluated Components
Mini-Assignments for the First Month (30 points total)
These small assignments are intended to give you an incentive to keep up with the readings when
we cover research fundamentals at the beginning of the semester. Four of these
mini-assignments, worth five points each, ask you to document an important question or
observation from the assigned introductory readings for each of the four class weeks in
September. In addition, a ten-point assignment due on September 12, 2018 will give you some
basic practice in finding research articles.
In-Class Examination over Research Fundamentals (130 points)
Wednesday, September 26 is scheduled for an in-class examination over the background material
to that point. The intent is to give all students the background necessary to engage a meaningful
evaluation of the research articles we will cover over the remainder of the semester.
Research Proposals (two proposals worth 100 points each, for a total of 200 points)
Starting in October through the first week of December, we will cover a different research theme
each week. Each Monday we will cover an article illustrating that week’s theme. With two
exceptions, the Wednesday class will be devoted to student proposals on research that could be
conducted within the same theme, broadly interpreted. The two exceptions are Wednesday,
October 3, when I will present a proposal I wrote myself to illustrate what I have in mind for
your proposals, and Wednesday, November 21, which begins the University holiday for
Thanksgiving. Each student will pick two of the eight available weeks to develop an individual
research proposal on that week’s theme. To avoid the problem of too many students picking the
same weeks, spaces for each week will be limited, available for selection on a first-come, first-
served basis via Canvas. For the students who select any given week, we will use the Wednesday
session to discuss proposals on a volunteer basis.
Although more detailed instructions will be provided later, the basic structure of each proposal
will be to (1) specify the research question of interest, (2) identify three articles relevant to the
question, and (3) refine the research question and develop a basic design to examine it. I do not
expect students to actually conduct the research they propose, but proposals should be specific
enough to provide a reasonable idea of what would need to be done.


ACC 380K.22 SYLLABUS (KACHELMEIER)                                                                   5
FALL 2018
Weekly Article Quizzes (160 points)
Beginning on Monday, October 1, each Monday session will begin with a 20-point quiz over the
article assigned for that day. The intent of these quizzes is to give you an incentive to read the
article before class, so that you can participate meaningfully in the class discussion. The first five
short-answer questions for each quiz will always be the same, as follows:
1. What is the primary research question addressed in this study?
2. In “Libby Box” format, what are the study’s primary independent and dependent constructs
   (i.e., the top two boxes) as well as its primary independent and dependent operational
   variables (i.e., the two bottom boxes)?
3. Name one insight from the findings that you believe is of particular practical importance.
4. Name one flaw or limitation of the study that you believe is of particular concern.
5. Name one thing from the article that you found particularly confusing.
These questions are worth six points in total. As these questions involve judgment and opinions,
any reasonable answers are acceptable. Thus, if you read the article and come prepared, you
should be able to get all six of these points in the vast majority of cases unless you significantly
misunderstand the article.
The remaining fourteen points will consist of seven multiple choice questions worth two points
each. Questions will cover my sense of the most important aspects of the article, but they may
come from any part of the article. (Interpretation: Do not just read the introduction and assume
you have done enough.) In fairness, I will not base questions on details from tables that are not
otherwise reasonably covered in the article’s narrative. (Interpretation: I do not expect you to
memorize tables, so as long as you read the narrative, you may safely just “skim” the tables. I do
expect you to read the article, however, including the conclusions it draws from the tables.)
To account for unexpected personal circumstances that may arise, I will drop your two lowest
quiz scores. Thus, the total score for this category will be based on eight quiz scores out of the
ten quizzes administered from Monday, October 1 through Monday, December 3, accounting for
the total maximum points available of 160 (= 8 × 20). With this structure, students can miss (or
score poorly) on up to two quizzes without penalty. Please understand, however, that I will still
be monitoring your attendance and class participation (see Class Participation on the next page).
End-of-Semester Structured Research Project (120 points)
In lieu of a final exam, I will provide detailed instructions for a research exercise in which
students will access data from the Audit Analytics database to investigate the association
between internal control findings and audit fees, as well as whether the nature of this association
differs between Big-Four and non-Big-Four audit firms. The statistical analysis, which involves
multiple linear regression, can be done on Excel, as I will explain. Your completed project must
be uploaded to Canvas by 10:45 a.m. on Monday, December 10, 2018, the last day of class. In
addition, students must bring a printed hard copy to turn in during class on December 10.


ACC 380K.22 SYLLABUS (KACHELMEIER)                                                                   6
FALL 2018
Class Participation (160 points)
A discussion-oriented class can only succeed with your help. Accordingly, I maintain a daily log
to document the students who were the most helpful in each day’s discussion. More specifically,
after each class (starting in week 2), I place each student to the best of my ability in one of five
categories for that day’s discussion:
Category 1: Did not attend and did not provide notification of an excused absence due to
              medical emergency, family emergency, religious holiday, or a conflict with a
              University-sponsored event. I also reserve the right to assign students to this
              category for disruptive and/or discourteous actions such as using cell phones when
              others are speaking, excessive tardiness, etc.
Category 2: Attended, but with no evidence of participation.
Category 3: Attended with at least some evidence of participation besides just attending.
Category 4: Attended with good evidence of participation.
Category 5: Attended with exceptional participation.
Notes:
    • Placement in Category 4 or 5 is not just based on the number of times you speak. Rather,
        I will do my best to monitor the quality of your comments. Even one comment in a class
        discussion can get you to Category 5 if it provides an exceptional insight that adds
        significantly to our understanding or offers an important new perspective.
    • I also take favorable note of students who comment meaningfully and constructively on
        other students’ proposals during the Wednesday sessions in October, November, and
        December.
    • For calibration, just attending class and doing nothing else all semester long will
        generally get you about half of the available participation points. I do not expect students
        to say something each and every day, but you should get in the habit of contributing your
        point of view rather than just listening to others.
    • Do your best to avoid Category 1, as unexcused absences will result in significant losses
        of participation points. Thus, at a very minimum, come to class. Students with an excused
        absence due to medical emergency, family emergency, religious holiday, or University-
        sponsored conflict are responsible for letting me know, along with providing appropriate
        documentation. Absences for recruiting purposes should be discussed with me in advance
        and will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with the understanding that students are
        responsible for working with recruiters (as recruiters promise us they will do) to avoid
        class conflicts if at all possible.
University Writing Center
If you have difficulty with written assignments, consider scheduling a free appointment with a
writing consultant at the UT-Austin University Writing Center (UWC). Writing consultants at
the UWC will work with you to improve your assignments in ways that preserve the integrity of
your work. For further details, see http://uwc.utexas.edu.

FALL 2018
Policy on Notifications on Canvas and via Email
I frequently post announcements on Canvas, so please to monitor this resource before every
class. In addition, I will sometimes contact you by email, consistent with the UT-Austin
authorization of email for University communication. I typically use the email function on
Canvas, so please make sure you monitor that address. For more information, see:
https://cio.utexas.edu/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy.
Student Safety and the Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
Please see http://www.utexas.edu/safety to familiarize yourself with campus safety initiatives.
Also see http://emergency.utexas.edu for emergency notifications. Regarding behavioral issues,
if you have concerns or are worried about someone who is acting differently, consider using the
UT-Austin Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss your concerns. This service is provided
through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental
Health Center, the Employee Assistance Program, and The University of Texas Police
Department. To reach the Behavior Concerns Advice Line, call 512-232-5050 or visit
http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal. You are also welcome to discuss any concerns with me; I will
take appropriate action as determined on a case-by-case basis.
Policy on Missed Assignments
My general policy is that medical emergencies, family emergencies, religious holidays, and
University-sponsored conflicts are the only valid reasons for missing an examination or the due
date of an assignment. For each such case, I require some form of supporting documentation,
such as a signed note from a physician. In the case of a conflict due to a University-sponsored
event, you must notify me as soon as you are aware of the conflict and before the examination
date or assignment due date.
Religious Holidays
Consistent with the UT-Austin policy on Observation of Religious Holidays, I will work with
students on a case-by-case basis to find a suitable make-up alternative in the event that a
religious holiday conflicts with a scheduled examination or assignment due date. By policy,
students must provide at least 14 days of advance notice of any such conflicts.
Policy on Students with Disabilities
I do my best to comply with guidelines set forth by the UT-Austin Office of Services for
Students with Disabilities (http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/current-students/). If you have an
SSD-registered accommodation letter, please see me with your letter to discuss the
accommodations you need for this course. Please understand that I can provide accommodations
only to students with approved SSD letters. Students must inform me of any SSD-related
requests at least 14 days in advance in order to ensure that accommodations can be made.

FALL 2018
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty and Working Together on Course Assignments
Policy of the MPA Program
The Master in Professional Accounting Program has adopted a Code of Conduct, a Career
Services Code of Ethics, and a Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty. It is important for you
to be familiar with all three documents, which are available at the following website:
https://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/MPA/Student-Codes-of-Ethics
The following statement applies to each class in the UT-Austin Department of Accounting:
    The Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
    responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are
    described in detail in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty in the
    MPA Program (which includes the integrated five-year MPA program and the traditional
    MPA program). By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all faculty
    responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to
    observe all student responsibilities described in that document. If the application of that
    Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your
    responsibility to ask me for clarification.
In simple terms, integrity is a public good from which we all benefit. I view the MPA Code of
Ethics as a commitment to integrity, not as a threat. Accordingly, I intend to conduct this course
in a friendly environment of trust and cooperation, but I can only achieve this goal if you join me
in maintaining an atmosphere of absolute ethical integrity. As the top-rated professional
accounting program in the country, we cannot afford any less.
Personal Policy on Working Together (applies only to this course)
I believe that learning takes place through a healthy exchange of ideas. Therefore, for this class,
you are welcome to discuss class assignments with other students. However, I expect the final
product of each assignment to reflect your individual effort. You may not copy or paraphrase
from others’ solutions. Examples intended to clarify this policy follow:
Examples of collaborative efforts that I welcome (applies only to this course):
•    A student is confused about an ambiguous aspect of an article, and asks another student
     what s/he thinks.
•    Students ask questions and share insights on the class discussion board. This is appropriate
     because everyone benefits.


ACC 380K.22 SYLLABUS (KACHELMEIER)                                                                 9
FALL 2018
Examples of collaborative efforts that I do not tolerate:
These examples draw from situations I have encountered. In each case, I pursued a Scholastic
Dishonesty charge with the Dean of Students and imposed an appropriate penalty.
• Student X completes an assignment before student Y. Y asks X for X’s solution. Y bases
  his/her completed assignment on X’s assignment, changing a few words here and there to make
  it look original. This is an example of plagiarism, which takes advantage of student X and does
  not evidence any meaningful learning on the part of student Y. Both X and Y are guilty of
  scholastic dishonesty.
  Please be aware that assignments submitted online via Canvas are subject to plagiarism-
  detection software. This software works by comparing submitted materials to a database of
  papers submitted by other students, as well as journals, essays, newspaper articles, books, and
  other published works. Other methods may also be used to determine originality. Plagiarism
  software does not substitute for the faculty member’s judgment regarding detection of
  plagiarism, but it is a tool that I use to maintain integrity on written assignments.
• A student copies from an article or other source without using quotation marks, indentation, or
  other references to acknowledge the source. This is another example of plagiarism.
• A student completes the end-of-semester project and gives the completed Excel and/or Word
  file to another student. In this case, both students would be guilty of scholastic dishonesty.
• Collaboration or any other form of cheating on a course examination or quiz is scholastic
  dishonesty of the most severe variety, which can result in a significant academic penalty, up to
  the possibility of an “F” for the course.
For more information on University policies and procedures regarding scholastic dishonesty, see
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/index.php.
When in doubt, ask me.
If you have read this far, thank you! The fact that you read nine pages of syllabus material shows
that you care about this class and want to succeed. History suggests that only about half of all
students even bother to read the entire syllabus, so I want to give you a small token of my
appreciation for being in that half. Accordingly, I have set up an online link that will award you
two class participation points just for typing in your name, if you do so by Friday, September 7,
2018. Thanks! To get your two points, go to:
