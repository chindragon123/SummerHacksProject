AMS 356/HIS 356K traces the development of American culture and society from the end of the Civil
War to the present. Major themes include racial conflict, pluralism, religion, urban development,
reform, modernism, government centralization, cultural radicalism, and the rebirth of conservatism.
Using a variety of sources and methods, this course explores how different communities organized
around identifiers such as race, ethnicity, national origin, class, gender, and ideology have negotiated
with and contributed to changing conceptions of American identity.
This course follows a rough chronology of the past 150 years divided into three major sections – 1865
to the early 1920s, the early 1920s to the mid-1960s, and the mid-1960s to the present –
demonstrating great transformations in American society, culture, and everyday life, while also
showing main currents and trajectories regarding individual, communal, and national identities. The
interdisciplinary approach of this course draws upon history, geography, sociology, literature,
popular culture, and other methods of inquiry to reveal a century and a half of political and social
conflicts that complicate narratives of national consensus.
Class format: This is primarily a lecture course but I encourage questions and discussion. Learning is
collaborative!
Requirements: Regular attendance, completion of all reading assignments, three exams.
Goals/outcomes: As members of this intellectual community, you will:
1. Gain a greater understanding of people, groups, events, and ideas since 1865 and how they have
impacted American culture and society in their time and in ours.
2. Engage with a variety of types of texts and evidence to become interdisciplinary interpreters of
American history.
3. Build critical thinking and analysis skills through written expression, including constructing thesis
statements and supporting your argument with evidence from lecture and readings.
Grading:
First exam                      25%     Tue Oct 2 (in class)
Second exam                     30%     Thu Nov 1 (in class)
Final exam                      35%     Day, time, location TBA
Attendance/participation        10%     Assessed at the end of the semester
Grading scale: A 93-100; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76; C- 70-72; D+ 67-69;
D 63-66; D- 60-62; F 0-59


Exam format: The first two exams will be closed book/notes and will contain FIVE (5) identification
questions (choice of 10) and ONE (1) essay question (choice of 2) covering material from that
particular unit. There will be a review session held before each exam. The final exam schedule and
location will be published about a month before the end of the semester. The final exam will be
closed book/notes and will contain EIGHT (8) IDs (choice of 15) and ONE essay (choice of 2). On the
final exam, the IDs will be taken from the last third of the course but the essay will require you to
integrate and synthesize material from the entire semester to construct your analysis. On all tests,
you will be expected to support your essay answers with evidence from the assigned readings and
lectures. For this reason, regular class attendance is crucial in order to do well in the course. Do not
rely on the inevitable Google doc as a substitute for reading or attending lecture. I do not post
lecture slides online.
Make-up policy: Failure to take a scheduled exam without making prior arrangements with the
teaching assistant or me will result in an automatic zero for that exam. I will allow you to take a
make-up exam only in the event of a medical or family emergency, or if you have official,
documented University of Texas at Austin business outside of campus. In both cases, you must notify
the TA or me BEFORE the scheduled exam, unless extraordinary circumstances while traveling to the
exam dictate otherwise, in which case official documentation will still be required. All make-up
exams must be taken within one week of the scheduled exam.
Post-exam protocol: If you would like the TA to review your exam after it has been graded, please
carefully review the comments and wait a minimum of 24 hours before contacting the TA.
Thereafter, make sure to address all questions about your grade within eight days after you have
received your exam back. If you do not reach an understanding with the TA, then I will be happy to
review your exam as well. Please keep your exams as they will help you as you review for the final
exam.
Required readings: All required texts will be in the course reader, available for purchase at Jenn’s
Copies (2518 Guadalupe St). I encourage each of you to be active readers and interact with the texts
by underlining, highlighting, and engaging with the texts as you see fit. Please show up to class each
day ready to discuss the assigned texts.
Attendance: Students are expected to attend class regularly and to participate as best they can in
such a sizable class. Just showing up to class is important but it is not the only factor in determining a
student’s participation. Various aspects of each student’s overall performance will be taken into
account, including attendance, pop quizzes, extra credit (if offered), participation in class discussion,
and efforts to communicate with the professor and teaching assistant outside of class. Attendance
will be taken either by a sign-in sheet or by attendance quizzes. Missing an excess of five class days
will result in a zero participation grade. Explained absences for religious holidays, sanctioned travel
related to sports or military service, or other absences you can plan in advance will not necessarily
count against you if at least one week’s notice is given. Unforeseen absences, such as illness or family
emergency, will be excused once proper documentation is provided, at my discretion. The
attendance policy will take effect on Tuesday, September 11.
Office hours: I encourage you to come to either my or the TA’s office hours during the semester so
you can get the most out of the course. This is an opportunity for you to discuss exam expectations,
aspects of the lecture material or readings, or just stop by to say hello.
Devices: I strongly suggest that you take notes by hand rather than with a computer or tablet.
Numerous scientific studies have shown that people remember lectures best when they’ve taken
handwritten notes. Laptops and tablets in class must remain silent and may not be used for any
reason other than course-related material (this should go without saying, but no phones are to be


used in class). I trust you to use technology responsibly, but failure to abide by this policy may result
in the revocation of in-class laptop/tablet privileges at my discretion.
Communication: Course-related announcements, relevant or interesting links, potential changes to
the course schedule, and other important information will be posted to the course Canvas site (and
therefore sent to you via email), so please check your email at least once per day. All emails sent to
me will be responded to within 24 hours of receipt unless unforeseen circumstances arise.
Classroom conduct: This course is built upon discussing topics that are often controversial and
difficult. I encourage all of you to share your informed opinions, feeling, and experiences, and to
engage in conversations that invite productive and respectful disagreement. As such, we all must
maintain respect for the classroom environment and for our colleagues: no name-calling, slurs,
interrupting, or otherwise fashioning a hostile environment. Be willing to have your own points of
view challenged and be willing to respectfully challenge others. The most productive and exciting
intellectual growth emerges from engaging with diverse opinions.
Concealed handgun policy: Per official University of Texas policy, “It is the responsibility of
concealed-carry license holders to carry their handguns on or about their person at all times while on
campus. ‘About’ the person means that a license holder may carry a holstered handgun in a backpack
or handbag, but the backpack or handbag must be close enough that the license holder can grasp it
without materially changing position. The holster must completely cover the trigger area and have
enough tension to keep the gun in place if jostled. A license holder may not carry a partially or wholly
visible handgun on campus premises or on any university driveway, street, sidewalk, parking lot,
parking garage, or other parking area.” With this in mind, consider that the simplest thing for
conceal-carry license holders to do would be to leave their handgun in a safe, secure location rather
than bring it to class.
Cultural Diversity flag: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural
Diversity courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the
American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to
come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one U.S. cultural
group that has experienced persistent marginalization. This course also fulfills the history core
curriculum requirement.
Students with disabilities: Any student with a documented disability who requires academic
accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259
(voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty members are not required to provide
accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.
Academic honesty: In an effort to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and integrity in the
classroom, cheating and plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. Cheating or plagiarism will result
in an automatic zero for the assignment and will be reported to the Dean of Students. University
policies regarding academic honesty are available at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php
TL;DR version: show up to class consistently, be respectful of each other, put phones away, use
laptops for class-related stuff only, don’t cheat on quizzes or exams.
