Description:
The Cuba in Question 2019 Maymester Study Abroad Program is organized to give UT students a unique
insight into a neighboring yet inaccessible country often misunderstood because of a history fraught with
political antagonism. Through onsite learning under the instruction of three rotating faculty with hands-on
knowledge and years of research, travel, and contacts in the country, students will be able to develop a
unique understanding of Cuba’s peoples, cultures, ethnicities, and social and historical processes far
beyond the common media stereotypes. They will have a chance to interact with Cubans in the island,
see for themselves the results and current conditions of the 1959 Revolution, and make up their mind
responsibly about issues regarding visual, material, and expressive cultures in the island; curatorial
debates about legacy and conservation in the arts; foreign affairs in Cold War and neoliberal geopolitics;
race relations and human rights; and post-Soviet socialism and national sovereignty through an up-close
engagement with local artists, writers, academics, curators, media specialists, and other social actors as
well as historical sites, archival and museum resources, and urban and natural landscapes.
This program is open to UT students who are curious about Cuba and wish to experience the country first
hand. It should be of interest to students majoring in Latin American Studies, African and Afro-American
studies, International Studies, Comparative Literature, History, Sociology, Anthropology, and Spanish,
among other fields. There will be a careful screening process to make sure students accepted have the best
aptitudes and skills for this type of experience abroad. Working knowledge of Spanish is preferred as well
as interest in comparative Caribbean literary, cultural, and visual studies and in Cuba’s role in the history of
the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the Afro-Caribbean diaspora, and race relations in the New World.
Maymester Topic for 2019: Cuba 2.0: Literature, Culture and Performance in Global Times
Course Materials:
Selections from these works will be studied or consulted during the trip or before, during the
