URBAN DESIGN : HISTORY . THEORY . CRITICISM
INTRODUCTION:
A graduate seminar: focusing on the body of history and theory that informs contemporary issues in urban design. The course will examine the state of the
contemporary discourse in urbanism, the historical trajectory of contemporary urban design theory, and its impact on design strategies as they pertain to the
construction of the urban landscape. 20th Century case studies are introduced to contrast and compare design practice with the theoretical underpinnings of
urban design discourse. While exploring the broader contexts of urban processes, the course also explores specific design strategies and devices established to
negotiate competing social and spatial forces in the urban landscape.
The theoretical positions in architecture and urbanism that have emerged as a result of the expanding metropolitan landscape and the resultant geographical
space of the open city have thrown urban design into a crisis. As architecture strives to regain its cultural relevance, the ongoing discourse of the city provides a
constructed ground for its participation. Professionals who are engaged in the formation of urban environments are ill equipped to confront the realities of the
constantly transforming infrastructure and socio-political change. While acknowledging that there is no longer a singular pervasive theory of the city, the
intention of this course is to open up for discussion, possibilities, and to postulate strategies for enabling an urban architecture to operate synthetically within
this realm. We will accomplish this through an extensive set of readings that discuss the key issues arising throughout 20 th century urban design theory and
practice, and by examining the transformation to the present urban situation.
 This course is required for students enrolled in The Graduate Program in Urban Design.


                                                                              UD : HTC
COURSE OBJECTIVES :
The class will be structured around lectures, tests, and discussions. Students will be expected to be able to make connections between the ideas presented in the
lectures and readings, and their impact on an increasingly urbanizing world, and the ways in which design can play a meditative role in the construction of the
urban environment.
In particular, students should be able to:
•     Evaluate the ways urban design theory and practice has shaped the contemporary landscape over time.
•     Examine the competing paradigms and discourses informing contemporary urban design.
•     Develop a critical understanding of the tactical initiatives being implemented in contemporary urbanism and their antecedents.
•     Explore design strategies based on an understanding of the complexity of urban landscape structure.
•     Develop an urban “vocabulary” in order to enable students to establish an agenda for urban design practice.
In pedagogical terms, the ultimate objective is to expand our knowledge and to intensify one’s critical abilities in evaluating and discussing design tactics for an
urban architecture grounded in the history of disciplinary knowledge.

ASSIGNMENTS :
Students will be expected to undertake extensive readings from the current and historical discourse in urbanism and be prepared to engage in discussions
around each weekly topic. While you will not be tested on all the readings, they are for your use as a record of many of the seminal ideas in urbanism.
Readings with a dot marked next to them are required and you may be tested on the material.
GRADING :
Your work will be evaluated on its rigor and evolution over the semester. Late assignments or tests will be dropped a letter grade for each class period missed,
unless an appropriate excuse (religious holiday, medical) is accepted by the instructor.
GRADE EVALUATIONS :
1 : Attendance:
Readings should be completed on the dates assigned by the instructor and are to be discussed and/or presented in class by each student. Your participation
during discussions is an important part of the class. Preparation for and participation in the discussion of the readings is fundamental to the success of the
course. Discussions are for reflection and debate on the material. It is not my role to lecture you on the readings, but merely to facilitate the discussions. I will
call on you and take attendance.
Attendance, readings and discussions shall be worth 5 percent of the course grade.


                                                                               UD : HTC
2 : Tests:
There will be four tests given throughout the semester. They will cover topics from both the readings, and the lectures. They will comprise a total of 95 per cent
of the course grade. Lecture material will be posted online and the tests will have diagrams and drawings to help stimulate your sense of reason. The questions
will primarily be in short answer format.
Each of the three tests will be worth 25 percent of the course grade.
The final test will be a take home test. It will be distributed on the last day of class and due during the course’s scheduled final exam period. It will be worth
20 percent of the course.
You are required to bring blue test booklets to class in order to record your answers to the tests. You must also turn in the tests along with your answer booklet.
Please make sure to write legibly and to put your name on all your work.
• Due dates for the all tests and course assignments are listed on the course syllabus.
GRADING SCALE :
This course will use the universities Plus/Minus system. Below is the conversion table from points to a numeric grade that will be used to determine your grade

F : unacceptable work
Mastery of course objectives is not met. Performance is not acceptable. Note that this grade will also be assigned when you have excessive unexcused
absences.
X : (excused incomplete)
Can be given only for legitimate reasons of illness or family emergency. Simply not completing work on time is not an adequate cause for assigning this
evaluation. It may only be used after consultation with the Associate Deans’ offices and with an agreement as to a new completion date.
ALL GRADES ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIONS for absences, late work and late arrivals.
CLASSROOM CONDUCT :
To make class time as valuable as possible, I propose the following principles to create a rigorous and respectful learning environment:
            Every student (and the instructor) has the right to learn as well as the responsibility not to deprive others of their right to learn.
            Every student (and the instructor) is accountable for his or her actions.
            Every student (and the instructor) will communicate with respect and civility in discussions.
            Every student (and the instructor) will behave with professionalism and integrity.
            Every student (and the instructor) will remember that learning includes laughter and having fun, but it can also be difficult, especially with an
            interdisciplinary group. Please practice patience with your community of learners.
            Conversations around the topics in this course will at times become political. Every student (and the instructor) must be tolerant of others viewpoints.
IN GENERAL :
Note: The course syllabus and outline is a guideline and is subject to change due to unforeseen circumstances during the semester.
Last day of the official add/drop period. (September 03)
Last day to drop a class without a possible academic penalty. (September 13)
In this class I use the CANVAS UT online system — a web-based course management system with password-protected access at http://courses.utexas.edu to
distribute course materials, to communicate and collaborate online, to post grades, to submit assignments. You can find support in using Canvas at the ITS Help
Desk at 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., so plan accordingly.

ATTENDANCE:
Attendance is mandatory. Attendance will be taken. Participation is expected. Students with three (3) unexcused absences may be dropped from the course
without further notice. The minimum penalty for more than three unexcused absences is a full letter drop in your final grade for the course. Please contact the
instructor prior to class if you expect to be late or miss class.


                                                                              UD : HTC
A student who is absent from a class for the observance of a religious holy day may complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence, if
proper notice has been given in advance of the days to be missed. A student who fails to complete missed work within the time allowed will be subject to the
normal academic penalties.
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HONOR CODE:
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the
university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
DOCUMENTED DISABILITY STATEMENT:

USE OF E-MAIL FOR OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE TO STUDENTS:
E-mail is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are responsible for reading your e-mail for university and course-related
information and announcements. You are responsible to keep the university informed about changes to your e-mail address. You should check your e-mail
regularly and frequently—I recommend daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related communications, some of which may be
time-critical. You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating your e-mail address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php
RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS:
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss
a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work
within a reasonable time after the absence.
BEHAVIOR CONCERNS ADVICE LINE (BCAL):
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another
individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center
(CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit
http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal
EMERGENCY EVACUATION POLICY:
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made.
PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING POLICIES REGARDING EVACUATION:
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered
the building.
If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office gives you instructions
Q DROP POLICY:
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:
“Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped
courses, including any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more
than that number.”
