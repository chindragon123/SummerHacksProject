COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This undergraduate course focuses on South Asia during the era of the Mughal empire.
Much of the Indian subcontinent came under the control of the Mughal dynasty, ushering
in a period of peace and prosperity during which long-lasting economic and cultural
linkages were formed between the various regions of the subcontinent. Aside from its
cultural splendor, political might, and booming economy, Mughal India is also important
for the many ways in which it shaped South Asia's development in subsequent centuries.
We will therefore look not only at Mughal India at the height of imperial power between
approximately 1550 to 1750, but also at the continuing legacies and symbolic relevance
of the Mughal dynasty in British India and in India today.
In the first half of the course, we will cover the basic political history of the period, as
scholars understand it, and also the popular memory of it in films, comic books, and on
the Internet. In the second half of the course, student will explore primary sources from
the Mughal period such as court chronicles and European travel accounts. Class sessions
will be a combination of instructor lectures, group discussion, and in-class exercises. By
the end of the semester, students should be familiar with the main developments of the
Mughal era and understand how the Mughal dynasty has been remembered by later
generations. In addition, they will have honed their analytical skills through critiquing
both primary and secondary sources.
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write
regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback
from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the
opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss
your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to
come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications
objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility,
established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
                                                                                             1


REQUIRED TEXTS (purchase first two at Co-op or get from PCL Reserves):
1) Michael H. Fisher, A Short History of the Mughal Empire
2) Audrey Truschke, Aurangzeb: The Life and Legacy of India's Most Controversial King
3) numerous essays, newspaper article, extracts from primary sources, etc. on Canvas
COURSE REQUIREMENTS:
Since the success of this course will depend heavily on student attendance and
participation, it is essential that students come to class sessions prepared to discuss the
readings and engage in in-class activities. Each student will take a leading role in one
discussion session during the semester, which will entail not only vigorous participation
but also the submission of a set of discussion questions. In addition, short written
responses to the readings (300 words) will be required on four occasions. There will be
two longer written assignments, beginning with drafts of a film-critique paper (1500
words) on a Bollywood movie, Jodhaa Akbar, with revisions based on peer review.
Toward the end of the semester, students will submit drafts of a paper evaluating an
original source (2500 words) from the Mughal era, along with at least one relevant article
from the secondary scholarship, to be revised after instructor feedback. In order to ensure
that students have grasped the basic historical framework of the period, there will be
three short quizzes early in the semester – these can be taken more than once until a grade
of 80 is attained.
Various aspects of student performance will be weighted as listed below in determining
the final grade for the course:
        Mughal-era source paper, 2 drafts (2500 words)                  30%
        film critique paper, 2 drafts (1500 words)                      20%
        4 reading responses (300 words each)                            20%
        attendance & participation                                      15%
        3 quizzes                                                       10%
        questions for discussion                                         5%
Please note that pluses and minuses to the final letter grade will be applied.
COURSE POLICIES:
-- During some class sessions you will be encouraged to access the Internet through your
laptop and/or other electronic device in order to engage in learning activities. On other
occasions laptops may be used only for note-taking or consulting reading assignments,
and smartphones should be kept out of sight. Your attention should be fixed on what is
going on in the classroom at all times, especially when your classmates are speaking!
Expect a negative impact on the participation component of your grade if you violate this
policy; be advised that I need not inform you should I observe a violation.
                                                                                            2


-- Student attendance and participation is critical to the success of this course. Students
will therefore be allowed no more than two absences without documented proof of good
reason (such as severe illness or death in the family). However, please note that
attendance is mandatory on February 19th, when we will conduct peer critiques of paper
drafts. Any additional absences will adversely affect the final grade for the course.
However, if you are having difficulty with the course or must be absent for a period due
to personal issues, please stop by during my office hours or be in touch by email. Don’t
wait until weeks have passed and it’s too late to catch up. Keep in touch!
-- The course website on Canvas will be used to post readings, assignments, and grades,
as well as announcements relating to the course – plan on checking the site regularly. It
is your responsibility to maintain a functioning email account linked to Canvas. You are
welcome to email me at any time – I will do my best to return your email promptly.
However, complex issues (or questions about grades) can be dealt with much more
effectively in person.
-- Please be prepared to complete assignments on the specified days, unless you have a
documented excuse. In order to encourage you to do so, I reserve the right to apply a
grade penalty for late assignments (equivalent to one letter grade per week).
-- Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. By UT
Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class session with
assigned work in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity
to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
-- Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
“As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of
the University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at
UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in a
previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism
and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are
responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code
which can be found at the following web address:

-- Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations
should contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 512-410-
6644 (Video Phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized
accommodations. http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
