                                           COURSE DESCRIPTION
1) Course Description: Digital Metrics serves as an introduction to digital metrics and digital analytics and how
this area is continuously growing. As technology has evolved, businesses are left with an abundance of data at their
fingertips, causing them to rely on strategic analysis to find creative ways to communicate with their key
stakeholders. This class will teach you to think strategically and creatively in the digital space through identifying
problems/challenges, creating a solution, and establishing important measures for success.
2) Course Learning Outcomes:
     WHAT:         Identify and discuss key issues affecting “big data” & digital media
     HOW:          Unit 1 will introduce students to the rise of “big data” and how the availability of data has
                   influenced privacy, audience targeting, and online ad buying.
     WHAT:         Learn how digital strategies are planned, implemented, tested, and measured in display,
                   search, and social media campaigns.
     HOW:          Unit 2 will feature overviews of Display, Search, and Social Media campaigns, including
                   planning, implementation, testing, and measurement.
     WHAT:         Analyze, visualize, and present data.
     HOW:          Unit 3 will include lessons on analytics tools, proper data visualization techniques, and data
                   storytelling through concise, accurate presentations. Students will add to their resumes by
                   completing Google Analytics and Google Ad Words certifications and will obtain a basic
                   proficiency in Tableau software.
     WHAT:         Implement a social media campaign, Analyze results, and Present learnings
     HOW:          Students will each complete a simulated social media campaign. They will be required to use
                   results to improve the performance of their campaign each week. At the end of the semester,
                   students will work in teams and discuss what they each learned from their completed simulations
                   and present what they feel an effective go-forward social media strategy would be for the
                   company.
3) Course Catalog Prerequisites: Advertising 345J with a grade of at least B, and consent of instructor; additional
prerequisites vary with the topic. Additional prerequisite: Upper-division standing.
4) How to succeed in this course:
          Come Prepared to Participate: Come to class having prepared for the day by reading and be ready to
          discuss the day’s material.
          Collaborate with Classmates: A career path in digital is driven through collaboration and discussion.
          Working in teams is crucial to brainstorming creative analytic solutions.
          Give Feedback: Throughout the semester, please give your feedback on how you learn, topics that interest
          you, or how this course can help you land internship and job opportunities.
                                         COURSE REQUIREMENTS:
1) Required Readings and Materials:
               o Stukent Mimic Social Software Access: More information to be shared on Canvas
               o Tableau Desktop Software – Free for students
               o The Course website on Canvas
               o Readings posted on the course website and/or distributed in class


2) Classroom Expectations:
        Mastery of Prerequisite material: Students should have a mastery of media planning as evidenced by
        progress in the Texas Media sequence or by demonstrating a strong interest in digital media.
        Respect your fellow classmates: In this course, we will have several class discussions. Opinions are
        welcomed; however, it is important to remember that others might not hold your same viewpoint.
        Discussions and healthy debates are an important part of the educational process. Please remember to
        respect your classmates and your professor in all classroom discussions. If you are in violation of this
        policy, you may be asked to leave the classroom. If you are asked to leave for behavioral violations, you
        will be counted as absent for the day.
        Know your industry: Students should read blogs, newsletters, or other periodicals that are relevant to the
        class discussion and provide thought-provoking content for class each week. Digital Media is a quickly
        evolving field, and it is crucial to stay on top of new developments.
        Take full advantage of every opportunity: The University of Texas at Austin and the Moody College of
        Communication provides many wonderful resources to students. You should take advantage of every guest
        speaker, workshop, meeting, etc. that is made available to you. So often these connections and lessons can
        help land you an internship or a job.
        Bring a laptop computer: I recommend bringing a laptop to lecture days. It is a digital class, so we will
        use our digital devices often. If you are not paying attention, because you are playing on your laptop or
        using social media, you may be asked to leave.
3) Major Course assignments: Assignments add up to a total of 700 possible points
        Exams: (2 exams - 100 points each, total 200 points): Students are expected to read all assigned
        readings. These exams will assess what students have learned from course readings, lectures, and lab
        activities.
        Online “Lab” Assignments: (25 points each (Testing Lab = 50 points), total 225 points): Students will
        complete a number of lab assignments on Friday that reinforce the topics discussed in class each week.
        Some labs will be hosted online through Canvas, and will give students a “low risk” opportunity to assess
        learning and mastery of weekly topics. These labs give you the opportunity to put into practice what you
        learn in class during the week. You WILL be working with BIG data. Other labs will involve students
        completing a social media marketing simulation throughout the semester. In this simulation, students will
        use the principles learned in this course to successfully manage a social media campaign. Simulations will
        be completed on Fridays online and are hosted by Stukent. Students must purchase access to the
        simulations as the “required text” for this course and sign up on their website. Additional information will
        be available on Canvas.
        Social Media Strategy Presentation (100 points): Students will work together in groups of five to discuss
        their primary learnings from completing their social media simulations. After establishing what they feel
        were “best practices,” students will complete a presentation that showcases a winning social media strategy
        for the company to implement moving forward.
        Google Analytics, Google Ad Words, and Digital Marketing Certifications: (125 points total):
        Students are required to complete the certification exams for Google Analytics and Google Ad Words to
        add to their resumes. If you have previously obtained these certifications, you will still need to retake the
        exams to get a grade for this course (it is always good to practice and refresh your digital knowledge).
        Students will be given class time to complete the certification courses. WHEN YOU COMPLETE YOUR
        EXAM, YOU MUST SCREENSHOT YOUR SCORE AND UPLOAD IT TO CANVAS. Students will
        also be required to select and complete one additional Digital Marketing Certification that requires them to
        complete a course in their specialized area. Again, this helps target resumes.


      Course Participation, Attendance, and Professional Conduct: (50 points): Come to class prepared and
      ready to actively discuss readings and lectures, interact with classmates, the instructor, and industry guests.
      You will learn that learning flourishes in an active environment, and you are expected to help foster
      engagement throughout the course. Repeated absences will lower this grade. Also, I will evaluate your
      final participation grade based using the following rubric:
      A = Student engages in all activities; interacts with class members during face-to-face by providing
      constructive feedback; participates on Canvas discussions and assignments; expresses individual thoughts
      and poses questions during each class session; actively participates in each small group session; volunteers
      for class discussion; prepared and familiar with course material when called upon; does not use technology
      (phones, tablets, laptops) inappropriately during class.
      B = Student sporadically fails to participate in-class discussion or on learning tasks. Student demonstrates
      lack of preparedness during class by not actively participating with group members to accomplish tasks.
      Student only occasionally volunteers for discussion, and comments/ questions are off-topic. Student uses
      technology (cell phones/tablets) for activities unrelated to the course. Student does not participate in all
      required activities on Canvas.
      C = Student seldom volunteers to express ideas or shares thoughts during face-to face meetings or
      participate via Canvas. Student’s responses to questions demonstrate vague familiarity with module
      readings. Student is passive during group projects and needs reminders to stay on topic or to actively
      participate. Student frequently uses technology (i.e. cell phone, tablets) inappropriately during class.
      D and below = Student never volunteers, cannot answer direction questions related to the readings,
      participates in few/no online discussion activities, and does not participate during face-to-face sessions.
      Student is routinely using technology inappropriately in class (i.e. texting, emailing, Facebook-ing, etc.).
      Lack of participation and preparedness, both online and face-to-face, is routine throughout the semester.
