• American university courses on American views of Islam vis-à-vis Islam itself would have made sense
at almost any time since the late 1940s. But such a course seems particularly relevant today in the light
of American presidential campaign rhetoric in 2015 and 2016 (e.g., “Islam hates us”) and negative
characterizations of Islam by officials in the American administration that took office in early 2017 (e.g.,
“Islam is a cancer [which] the American Founding Fathers wanted nothing to do with”) and that
administration’s pursuit of a ban on the entry to the U.S. of citizens of so-called Muslim countries. Such
statements and actions have helped intensify and crystallize specific, longstanding, and categorial
negative perceptions about Islam on the part of many Americans.
• This course on American perceptions of Islam vis-à-vis Islam itself first reviews upwards of twenty-
five common and documented American perceptions of Islam, among them: (1) Islam does not allow for
freedom of interpretation of its Koran–because the Koran presents God’s exact Arabic words to
humankind, no room for debate or variegated interpretations exist for its readers; (2) Islam is a sort of
monolith without the varieties in beliefs and practices that characterize Christianity around the world;
(3) The Koran preaches intolerance toward believers of other religious faiths; (4) Islam (has) expanded
as a religion primarily through military force, with the Koran mandating war and violence to further the
spread of Islam and preaching jihad or holy war as a Muslim duty; (5) The Koran posits a clearly stated
materialistic reward in the afterlife, with riches, comfort, food and drink, and companionship for males,
which rewards provide a vision and incentive for Muslim men to carry out acts of violence on earth with
disregard for their own lives; (6) The Muslim prophet Muhammad was a sensualist, an opportunist, a
ruthless warrior, and a calculating politician; (7) Muslim peoples do not know how to separate church
and state or to institute democratic forms of government; (8) Islam posits an inferior position for women
vis-à-vis men, a view that Koran chapter on women states categorically; (9) Islam calls on Muslims not
only to do good and avoid evil, but to see to it that others do good and avoid evil–more specifically,
Islam calls for the implementation of Shari’a religious law throughout the world.
• The class then examines American writing voicing these perceptions (in files in the course’s Dropbox
folder) and assesses those perceptions in the context of four course texts:
         (1) The Koran;
         (2) No god but God: Updated Edition (2011) by Reza Aslan;
         (3) commentary and essays by Muslim scholars and critics addressing relevant issues
             (available in the course Dropbox folder); and
         (4) a series of PowerPoint presentations on “American Perceptions of Islam,” and “Islam,
             Pillars of Islam, the Koran, and Islamic Architecture,” “Islam as Defined by Iranian Art,”
             “Rumi, Sufism, and Islam,” and “Iranian Culture” (available at www.Issuu.com and
             distributed to e-mail addresses vis We Transfer). Course notes and exercises,
             including handouts, also appear as files in the course Dropbox folder.


• As for the Koran, parts of which are assigned reading through the course, students can choose whatever
“authorized” online or hard copy translation they prefer. Wikipedia lists 70+ translations published since
1900, while a Google search for online translations yields a score of versions. Here are five translations
that the course instructor uses:
         • The Koran. Translated by N.J. Dawood. Penguin Classics, 2006.
         • The Qur’an. Translated by M.A.S. Abdel Haleem. Oxford’s World Classics, 2016.
         • The Qur'an. Translated by Tarif Khalidi. Penguin Classics, 2008.
         • The Study Quran. Edited by Seyyed Hossein Nasr. HarperOne, 2015. lix, 1988p.
         • www.quod.lib.umich.edu/k/koran/browse.html
Class discussion of Koran chapters and passages involves consideration of translation differences as a
means of further appreciation of the complexity of meaning and richness of expression in the original
Arabic. Such discussion, along with listening to online recorded recitations of Koran passages and
chapters, also serves a further purpose, that being to counterbalance the common reaction of readers of
the Koran in English that the book seems un appealing in literary terms, whereas it strikes many readers
of the original Arabic as extraordinarily appealing.
• At the same time, after a demonstration that multiple Islams exist rather than a single Islam, the
course focuses attention on one discrete Islam, the 12er Shi’ite Islam of Iran, the major Muslim society
that arguably receives the strongest stereotypical and negative criticism in America. In addition to
academic data on the theology and history of Twelver Shi’ite Islam and its role as the Iranian state
religion since the beginning of the 16th century and on Islam in Iran today, both as the metaphorical flag
and sword of the dictatorial and oppressive theocratic Islamic Republic of Iran and as a core element in
the culture of the vast majority of Iranians, the course also treats anecdotal evidence offered by the
instructor, who lived and worked in Iran for over six years, two of them as a teacher in the city of
Mashhad, Iran’s second largest city and chief religious center and pilgrimage destination, and whose
social life in Austin involves regular interaction with Muslim Iranian Americans.
• The course concludes with consideration both of factors and reasons behind misperceptions about
Islam on the part of many Americans and of those ideas and practices and features of various Islams that
Muslim scholars and critics themselves argue need reforming or changing or abandoning.
• The bases for course grades are: class participation and oral reports on assigned readings, i.e., sections
of course texts (25% of the course grade); two review tests (25% each)–the course has no final
examination–; and a 10-page term paper addressing a specific American perception of Islam (25%). The
course grading scale is: A (93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B-(80-82), C+ (77-79), C
(73-76), C-(70-72), D + (67-69), D (63-66), D- (60-62), and F (0-59).
• Students who miss a class, an assigned recitation or oral report, or a review test in order to observe a
religious holy day will have the opportunity to complete the missed work. Students with disabilities may
