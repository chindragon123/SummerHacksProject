Course Overview
        This course provides an overview of human biological and cultural evolution in
Africa. The roots of humankind go back almost 6 million years on the continent. This is
an enormous time when one considers that human history in the New World only began
less than 17,000 years ago. In addition, the African continent makes up over 20% of the
earth’s landmass and is more than three times the size of the continental United States!
        Today there are more than a thousand languages spoken in Africa and cultural and
ecological diversity is great. Apart from Egypt, Ethiopia, and the Swahili and
Mediterranean coasts, however, written sources only document the last few centuries of
the continent’s history.
        The first few weeks of the class will present an overview of the physical,
environmental, cultural and linguistic diversity of the continent. The course will then
focus on the evolution of humankind from its early beginnings over 3 million years ago
up to the beginnings of early civilizations in Africa. (The following semester the
Archaeology of African Thought (ANT 324L) will look more closely at the development
of the ancient civilizations of Ancient Egypt, Axum, Ghana, Kongo and Great Zimbabwe.
The relationships between religion, gender, culture and power will be more fully
addressed in that second course.)
        Your books have been selected to discuss different aspects of Africa’s long
history. Barham and Mitchell focus on a detailed archaeological presentation of the early
history of the continent. John Reader presents a more generalized overview of the
continent’s history that extends from earliest times into the present. The Reader book will
be used for both semesters. The Reich book presents in a readable fashion the results of
very recent ancient DNA studies that promise to revolutionize our understanding of the
human past and migrations. The work also points up the need for more intensive
collaboration between archaeologist, linguists, and geneticists.
        The lectures will not follow the readings directly, but rather expand on them to
bring material up to date and include discussions of African peoples, cultures and
languages. Students are encouraged to raise questions during the lectures in order to
ensure that topics of interest to you are discussed—it is your class after all. No prior
knowledge of Africa or of archaeology is expected.
        The course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed
to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. Therefore, a


                                                                                             2  
substantial portion of your grade will come from assignments covering the practices,
beliefs, and histories of non-U.S. cultural groups, past and present.
Prerequisites: None.
Required Textbooks:
1) Lawrence Barham and Peter Mitchell. 2008. The First Africans: African Archaeology
from the earliest toolmakers to the most recent foragers. Cambridge World Archaeology.
ISBN-10: 0521612659. Parts of this text will be updated in lecture.   
2) John Reader. 1999. Africa: biography of the Continent. Vantage Press. ISBN
067973869x. While it does not focus only on archaeology, many will find this book
easier to follow than Phillipson. It provides a very readable, if slightly dated, account of
Africa’s history and prehistory. It also provides a useful summation of geology, climate,
health, languages and many other details not covered in depth in Phillipson. This is a
book you would probably keep if you have a general interest in Africa.
3) David Reich. 2018. Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New
Science of the Human Past. Pantheon Books. Isbn 978-1-101-87032-7. This book
explores new approaches to human prehistory, integrating them with, while challenging,
other archaeological interpretations.
Evaluation: The grade will be based on a map quiz (15%); class attendance and
participation will be measured by Arkaive (5%), enrollment code is 6P4Z; a short 5-page
mid-term essay (30%); and a 15 page research paper (50%) due at the end of the
semester. Grading will be on a +/- basis.
Because lectures will often include material not found in the text, or bring text materials
up to date through discussion of new findings, class attendance is important and will be
spot-checked using “attendance quizzes.” Please don’t think that you will be able to skip
class and simply do the readings. You will only be cheating yourself. The research paper
is due in class, Tuesday, December 4th.
The weekly timing of course topics below are only an estimate because I want to have
time to discuss any questions you may have from lectures or readings as they arise.

Paper 1: (Due Tuesday, Oct. 24)
Use the archaeological record to discuss and critique the "Sudden/late" or "Rubicon"
hypothesis of Richard Klein, Spencer Wells, and others that modern human cognition,
language abilities, and the ability to construct and use symbols appeared suddenly
around 60-70 thousand years ago and well after the first appearance of physically
modern-appearing Homo sapiens in Africa between 160 – 200 ka. From the Reich book,

Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops
for academic reasons to six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231: “Beginning
with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not
permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses,
including any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of
higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more
than that number.”
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate
and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is
made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
* Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building.
Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you
entered the building.
* If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first
week of class.
* In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class
instructors. Do not reenter a building unless you are given instructions by the
Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire
Prevention Services office.
