What happens in labs?
• A quiz on the previous week’s material will be held in the first 10 minutes for labs 2-10. If you are late, you
  will miss the quiz.
• We will make extensive use of the lab manual assigned to this course. Be sure to bring it to the first lab
  and all other labs unless we tell you otherwise.
• Lab 1 will consist of a walk about campus and several microscope activities from your lab manual. Be
  prepared to be outside. Bring water; wear a hat.
• Most labs involve looking at slides and fresh/preserved plant materials and working activities in the lab
  manual. Labs 7-9 involve experiments.
• You must attend the lab for which you are registered, unless you make arrangements with Jake.
• You must attend all labs. We don’t have a way to make up missed labs.
• Expect to spend the entire lab period in lab.
