                           practices. Industries from sports and fashion to hospitality
       (or by appointment) and health care need to recruit culturally competent media
                           professionals. As consumers, it is also important to
                           understand how these trends shape our experience.

                           engage multicultural audiences, and analyze the role of
                           current campaigns in reinforcing social dynamics or
                           promoting cultural consciousness and social change.

Student Rights & Responsibilities
    § You have a right to a learning environment that supports mental and physical wellness.
    § You have a right to respect.
    § You have a right to be assessed and graded fairly.
    § You have a right to freedom of opinion and expression.
    § You have a right to privacy and confidentiality.
    § You have a right to meaningful and equal participation, to self-organize groups to improve
        your learning environment.
    § You have a right to learn in an environment that is welcoming to all people. No student shall
        be isolated, excluded or diminished in any way.
With these rights come responsibilities:
    § You are responsible for taking care of yourself, managing your time, and communicating
        with the teaching team and with others if things start to feel out of control or overwhelming.
    § You are responsible for acting in a way that is worthy of respect and always respectful of
        others.
    § Your experience with this course is directly related to the quality of the energy that you
        bring to it, and your energy shapes the quality of your peers’ experiences.
    § You are responsible for creating an inclusive environment and for speaking up when
        someone is excluded.
    § You are responsible for holding yourself accountable to these standards, holding each other
        to these standards, and holding the teaching team accountable as well.
Statement of Respect and Inclusivity
You are expected to contribute to an inclusive and respectful class environment. Students of all
backgrounds are to be treated fairly and with honesty, integrity, and respect. We will cover sensitive
issues in class. Civil discourse, reasoned thought, sustained discussion, and constructive
engagement without degrading, abusing, harassing, or silencing others is required of all students.
Names and Personal Pronouns
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics
dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender
variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to instructors with the student’s legal name. I
will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise
me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold
these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a
student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and
uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words
or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in a previous class), you must cite your
sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action,
including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and
                                                                                          ADV 336 |     5


the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php.
You should be aware that all required writing assignments may be submitted to a plagiarism-
detection tool such as Turnitin. Turnitin is a software resource intended to address plagiarism and
improper citation. The software works by cross-referencing submitted materials with an archived
database of journals, essay, newspaper articles, books, and other published work. In addition, other
methods may be used to determine the originality of the paper. This software is not intended to
replace or substitute for my judgement regarding detection of plagiarism.
Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students
E-mail is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are
responsible for reading your e-mail for university and course-related information and
announcements. You are responsible to keep the university informed about changes to your email
address. You should check your e-mail regularly and frequently—I recommend daily, but at
minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related communications, some of which
may be time-critical. You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating your e-mail
address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the
date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, quiz, assignment, or project in
order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work
within a reasonable time after the absence.
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-
drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are
only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more
information, see: https://ugs.utexas.edu/vick/academic/adddrop/qdrop.
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you
from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we can develop a
plan to meet your need and the requirements of the course. The University also provides a range of
resources to help you achieve your academic and personal goals:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical
information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the
building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective
learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as
early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also

BeVocal

intervene and reduce harm. To learn more about BeVocal and how you can help to build a culture of
care on campus, go to: https://wellnessnetwork.utexas.edu/BeVocal.

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally
funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working
environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our
community, the university can:
     1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
     2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or
        have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
     3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
“Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the
Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related
incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with
any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a
responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without making
an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about
reporting options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at
titleix@austin.utexas.edu.

        building.

        first week of class.
