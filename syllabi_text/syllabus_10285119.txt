What would Karl Marx have to say about Wakanda? Can reading Plato change the way we
watch Star Trek? You might be familiar with the dystopias of 1984 or Brave New World, but did
you know that in 19th-century America, utopian fiction was all the rage? In this course, we will
explore the concept of utopia in fiction. We begin the course by reading some of the political
philosophy that inspired the “golden age” of utopian fiction (1880s-1920). You will read
emblematic utopian fiction novels including Looking Backward by Edward Bellamy and Herland
by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. The rest of the course will focus on utopian themes in literature,
film, theory, and television from the 1890s to 2000s that fall outside of this genre.
You will grapple with the blurred lines between fiction and idealism; racism, sexism, and other
prejudices in “equitable” worlds; personal versus social utopias; what culture and identity look
like in utopias; and the often-unclear distinctions between dystopias and utopias. The utopias
we explore are political and personal. They are all explorations of and responses to the utopian
visions and (failed) experiments of radical political thought.
This course includes texts that include sexual trauma, racism, violence, and offensive language.
We will be discussing these elements of the course literature as well as our emotions and
reactions to them. Try to avoid using the disrespectful and judgmental language in class
discussions and your written assignments unless you are specifically quoting the authors. You
may leave a discussion if you find it extremely distressing or detrimental to your mental health,
but please note that I will not provide alternative texts or assignments as substitutions for
difficult pieces.
Students are required to post and respond to discussion questions on Canvas every week
unless otherwise stated. These posts will be evaluated as complete or incomplete and count
toward your final grade. You will be randomly assigned into one of three groups—Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday—which will determine when you are required to post a discussion
question. The other two days, you will respond to your classmates’ questions.
In addition to your weekly posts, you will write four Think Pieces, a midterm essay (and
revision), and a final paper.
Reading and viewing assignments should be completed before class on the date for which they
are listed. This literature-based seminar class cannot work if you do not do the readings!
You are allowed two unexcused absences before it will affect your grade.


Grade percentage breakdown:
Think Pieces: 20%
Weekly discussion posts: 15%
Midterm essay: 25%
Final paper: 20%
Attendance and participation: 20%
Though Attendance and Participation are worth 20% of your grade, I reserve the right to
assign you a failing grade if you miss 6 or more classes. If you receive a C+ (79%) or
lower on your midterm, you are required to revise it to earn a passing grade. I highly
recommend coming to office hours to discuss revisions before you hand them in. It is
even better if you come before the paper is due. If you receive a B- to B+, you can choose
whether or not you wish to revise your paper.
You will have the opportunity to revise your first two think pieces, which are pass/fail, if
you fail them. After that, you are on your own.
There will be opportunities for extra credit to raise your final grade by 1-5 percentage points
throughout the semester.

You are expected to abide by the University Code of Conduct and the Student Honor Code,
which are both stated here:
"The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community."
"As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the
University and uphold academic integrity."
If you have any uncertainty as to what constitutes cheating or intellectual dishonesty, please see
the official eleven-point definition at http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-
information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-conduct/. They will not be tolerated
and are grounds for course failure.


Upon request the University provides appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at
471-6259, 471-6441 TTY. If you know you will be requesting an accommodation, please submit
your letter during the first two weeks of the semester. While I will not require you to disclose
your disability to me, if you are comfortable with doing so I recommend meeting to discuss
accommodations with me at the beginning of the semester. Reasonable accommodations may
include additional absences/alternatives to missed classes, additional options to revise, and
extended deadlines.
Additionally, if you are a parent or otherwise responsible for the care of a family member, we
can discuss ways to accommodate sudden changes in your schedule due to issues with
childcare, eldercare, or illness. If you find yourself unexpectedly experiencing a crisis such as
food or housing insecurity, homelessness, or other income insecurities that affect your ability to
come to class or complete schoolwork, please see me so that we can discuss accommodations
and alternatives and connect you to student emergency services.
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly
during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your
instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or
more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag
classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication,
Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education
Coordinating Board.
The Writing Flag faculty committee also provides statements on Plagiarism and Academic
Integrity and Plagiarism Detection Software:
Plagiarism and Academic Integrity
Using someone else’s work in your own writing without giving proper credit is considered
plagiarism, a serious form of academic dishonesty that can result in severe penalties. Copying
someone else’s work, buying a paper and submitting it as your own, copying and pasting text
(even with changes), or borrowing images from an online source, are some examples of
plagiarism. Even if you plagiarize accidentally, you can be held responsible and penalized.
Learning to cite sources appropriately is an important part of becoming a professional. When
you are unsure about citation, you are encouraged to ask your instructor (who is already an
expert in the discipline) what is appropriate in the context of your assignment. Consultants at
The University Writing Center can also help you determine whether you are citing sources
correctly—and they have helpful guides online for using direct quotations and paraphrasing.
Reviewing those skills will help you feel confident that you are handling sources professionally
in your writing.


You can read the University’s definition of plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty in
Sec. 11–402 of the Student Conduct Code. For more information, visit the Dean of Students’
site.
