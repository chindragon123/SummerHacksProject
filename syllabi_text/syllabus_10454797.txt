Geography 301K - Weather and Climate (Unique # 80375) - On Line
Second Summer Semester 2020
Use of Class Materials
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are
copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying and selling of the class materials is a violation of federal law
and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student. Additionally, the sharing of class materials
without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code
and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action. This includes, among other
things, uploading any and all class materials (including class notes) to web sites for the purpose of selling and/or
sharing those materials with other current or future students.
“Non Technology” Classroom (for in person classes only)
I prohibit the use of laptop computers and smart phones (including texting) during class time unless specified by
the instructor and/or TA. This is a “zero tolerance” policy - we will be monitoring the classroom and will stop
lecture and ask anyone using a device to turn it off. My expectation is that you are here to listen to and take part in
lecture. Accordingly, your class notes must be taken with paper and pen.

CLASS OBJECTIVES:
Our study of weather and climate is intended for Geography / Environment majors and all others interested in a broad brush examination
of the atmospheric and climatic sciences. This study will be introductory in nature with only a very basic use of mathematics. We will start
with a study of meteorology. From this foundation, we will go into the different aspects of the atmosphere and then, later, into
climatological matters and discuss the various climatic regimes including that of Texas and the local area.
ATTENDANCE:
While this is probably not going to be the hardest course you've ever taken (or will take) in your college career, it is intensive. This is due,
primarily, to the amount of material to be covered during the semester. It is, therefore, my philosophy that your success in this course will
vary directly with your daily online class attendance. Be aware of the fact that on line class attendance will be monitored/taken on a
regular basis, through the SquareCap classroom management application (which will be necessary for you to purchase); we will be using
this application through your smart phone web browser. This attendance information will be used in the computation of your final class
grade. Excessive absences will work against you while perfect attendance can help you to the next highest letter grade in borderline
situations at the end of the semester.
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS / POLICY ON SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY:
In this class, there is zero tolerance for students who violate university rules on scholastic dishonesty with all suspected cases turned
over to the University’s Dean of Students office. Penalties for scholastic include the possibility of failure of course and dismissal from the
University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, fellow students and the integrity of the University, policies
on scholastic dishonesty will be STRICTLY ENFORCED in this class.
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA):
The University of Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more
information, contact the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259, 471-6441
TTY, 866-329-3986 video phone or via email ssd@austin.utexas.edu.
If you have documentation regarding accommodations from the Dean of Students office, you must meet with me, during on line UT
Canvas Zoom office hours, as early as possible in the semester to discuss exact accommodations. You must have your UT
accommodation paperwork completed Accommodations are NOT effective until you meet with me in on line office hours with
your completed paperwork being available. No exceptions.
TEXTBOOK MATERIAL:
We will utilize the following textbook during the semester:
Essentials of Meteorology (8th Edition) - C. Donald Ahrens - Required (No other publisher material needed, so new or used OK)
Goode's World Atlas (23rd Edition) - Recommended
These books are available at the University Coop and other campus bookstores as well through on-line textbook web sites.
Please shop around for the best price.


GRADING PROCEDURE:
Your final grade will be determined by your numerical performance - out of 700 points - on the examinations/exercises as noted:
Examination #1                                   200 points
Examination #2                                   200 points
Examination #3                                   200 points
Place Name Examination                            50 points
Examination #4                                   200 points
Attendance Quizzes/Exercises                      50 points
Only three of the regular examination scores will count; the lowest of the four grades will be dropped (see MAKE-UP EXAMINATIONS).
All numerical scores will be added together to arrive at a possible 700 points at the end of the semester, where, when utilizing the UT
“Plus” / “Minus” Final Grade Grading System...
630-653 = A- (GPA earned = 3.67), 654-700 = A (GPA earned = 4.00)
560-582 = B- (GPA earned = 2.67), 583-605 = B (GPA earned = 3.00), 606-629 = B+ (GPA earned = 3.33)
490-512 = C- (GPA earned = 1.67), 513-535 = C (GPA earned = 2.00), 536-559 = C+ (GPA earned = 2.33)
420-442 = D- (GPA earned = 0.67), 443-465 = D (GPA earned = 1.00), 466-489 = D+ (GPA earned = 1.33)
0-419 = F (GPA earned = 0.00)
All 200 point exams and the place name exam in this class are on line (through the UT Canvas Quizzes and the Proctorio Extension) and
given outside of our class time during the mid and late afternoon hours (see the class material time line on the fourth page of this
syllabus for the four exact dates).
All examinations will be objective (multiple choice). Exams will not be returned to you although your exam key (showing you the number
of the question you missed) will be available through Canvas after each exam; If you want to go over your answers, you must meet with
me during on line office hours. Any questions regarding exams will be brought forth within five (5) days after the exam date otherwise the
grade is considered final.
MAKE-UP EXAMINATIONS:
There will be NO make-up of the four regular examinations under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. It's precisely for the reasons of sickness and
other unplanned absences as well as for the occasional "bad" test day that I allow the lowest of your regular four examination scores to
be dropped. Also, please note that you are required to take the final exam on the date and time as specified by the University (no
excused absences).
EXAMINATION DAYS:
All exams will be on line and outside of class time. They will be done through the UT Canvas Quiz option utilizing the Proctorio
Extension. In order to take the exams, you MUST utilize the Google Chrome browser and you MUST install the Proctorio Extension in
advance by going to https://getproctorio.com/ .
CLASSROOM / CAMPUS EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS:
The status of University of Texas campus activities in times of emergency (i.e., severe/inclement
weather) along with some important procedures in case of emergencies on our campus as well as in our classrooms can always be
found on the University of Texas Emergency Web Page.
The University of Texas maintains Emergency Action Plans that addresses emergencies that could potentially affect the our community.
You can reference the various plans here.
Our UT Siren System is used in times of emergencies when it is necessary for you to "shelter in place" in campus buildings (remain in or
go to the nearest building on campus when the siren is activated and remain there until the "all clear" is given). The UT Siren System, as
part of policy, is tested monthly on the first Wednesday of every month between 11:50 am and 12:00 noon. Please don't take the siren
system tests for granted; be ready to take action if the siren system is activated!
We will discuss, during the first class day of the session, our emergency plan for our specific classroom in case of fire, severe/inclement
weather and other different situations. Please take this discussion seriously and ask any questions that you may have!!
UT POLICY ON EMAIL NOTIFICATION
Instructor to student email is a recognized and accepted form of official communication here at the University of Texas.
It is critically important that (1) you make sure to have your current and most frequently checked email address on file in UT Direct and
(2) you check it on a daily basis. I will send class email frequently during the semester and you'll be given updates and change notices in
references to lectures as well as exams.
