MAS 311 Ethnicity & Gender: La Chicana
                      Course Overview
                      The term “Chicana” has its roots in the 1960’s-70’s Civil Rights Era and the Chicano
                      Movement. Beginning in this rich activist heritage and ending in our current political
                      moment, in this class we will deconstruct the term “Chicana,” discovering and
                      celebrating the plurality of meanings and identities that make up the word. We will do
                      this work through a survey of multiple genres—poetry, essay, testimonio, and more—and
                      we will have the opportunity to see how Chicanas have interrogated and manipulated
                      different forms in order to best express their hybridized selves.

 Major Assignments
 Essays (35%): Each student will write two critical essays that respond to any of the course readings completed up to
 that point. We will workshop essay drafts in class, and each student will have an individual conference with me to
 discuss the grade and potential revisions. Essays will be turned in both via Canvas AND as a hard copy turned in at
 the end of class on the submission date. Essays will not be considered turn in until both an electronic and hard copy
 have been received.
 Midterm (15%): Each student will take a midterm in class on the date recorded in the schedule. This midterm will be
 conducted via Canvas, and students will need to bring an electronic device to complete the exam. The exam will be
 comprised of key terms, short answer, and a short essay response to one of three given prompts.
 Final (30%): Each student will take a final exam via Canvas, to be completed on their own time and submitted on the
 date recorded in the schedule. The final will be comprised of three short essay responses to five given prompts. The
 student will have the option to choose which prompts they answer.
 Minor Assignments
 Participation (10%): Each student will receive a participation grade based on a variety of factors. These include
 speaking in class, performing small group activities in class, pop quizzes, and attendance. I understand that speaking in
 class might be difficult for some, and participation should consider more than just class discussion. Therefore,
 emailing me with specific questions or comments about the day’s lecture and visiting me in office hours will also
 count toward participation.
 Reading Responses (10%): Each student will need to complete 10 reading responses over the course of the
 semester. These write-ups need to be 1-2 pages long, double-spaced. Students can choose whichever texts they prefer
 to write about. Reading responses will be turned in as a hard copy at the beginning or end of class. These writings
 should be thoughtful considerations, critiques, or reflections surrounding the text. These are not summaries, and
 failing to follow these instructions will affect the grade received.
 Class Policies
 Accessibility: Your success in this class is important to me. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from
 learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your
 needs and course requirements. Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations
 should contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone) as
Spring 2019                                                                                                         Page 5


 soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations. More information is available on
 the Services for Students with Disabilities website at http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd
 Behavior: Be respectful of your colleagues. There is zero tolerance for slurs or derogatory language. In general, don’t
 discriminate based on race, gender presentation, marital status, religion, disability, age, or sexual orientation. Everyone
 in our class has the right to be addressed in accordance with their personal identity. Everyone has the right to be
 addressed and treated in way that respects her/his self as an individual. Please let me know what I can do to make
 sure you feel respected in my classroom environment and able to engage with the material and with others. If you find
 a reading or assignment triggering in any way, or suspect that you will be triggered, please contact me as soon as
 possible. I am happy to speak with you about the content of the material in advance and/or provide you with an
 alternative assignment. If you are troubled by or feel unsafe in any class discussion, please speak with me as soon as
 possible so that we can work to resolve the immediate problem and prevent future issues.
 Discussion: It is never okay to laugh at, belittle, or harass a colleague because of their opinion or point of view.
 Always think about how your comments will support our learning as a group. But safe doesn’t mean operating in an
 environment where beliefs and ideas go unchallenged. Challenging colleagues to explain their arguments in a
 thoughtful manner is key to creating an engaging learning community.
 •        Make a commitment to understand unfamiliar positions from the context or point of view of your peers.
 •        Speak for yourself rather than for a group (use your “I” statements).
 •        Be present – really listening to your colleagues will dramatically improve your in-class experience and prevent
          most understandings.
 •        Take risks in speaking honestly; this will help the learning of the group.
 Late Work: If you believe your assignment will not be submitted on time, please send me an email explaining your
 situation. Once an assignment is 24 hours late without notice, I will automatically begin deducting one half-letter
 grade per day until it is received.
 Attendance: Students are required to come to class. This is a class centered upon small group reading and discussion,
 and your presence is essential to the integrity of the course. Each student is allowed 5 absences (there is no
 designation between unexcused and excused absences). I will send an absence/failing report upon the 3rd absence.
 Once a student reaches 6 absences, they will not receive credit for the course.
 Tardiness: If you have a schedule conflict (class, appointment, emergency) that will prevent your arriving to class on
 time, please send me an email explaining your situation. Three extreme cases of tardiness (more than 15 minutes) will
 equal one recorded absence. If you have a class before mine that is particularly far, please speak with me so I can be
 aware and we can come up with an arrangement.
 Technology: Although I strongly encourage taking handwritten notes and reading assigned articles in hard copy,
 laptops and tablets are allowed for the purposes of viewing course materials and for taking notes. Cell phones should
 be silenced and should not be used during class. If your use of technology becomes distracting to yourself or others, I
 will ask you to put it away. If the problem continues, I may count you absent for the class period.
 Email: Email is the best means of communication for me. While I generally check my email on a regular basis, my
 inbox can become quite full with this number of students. I can guarantee a reply within 24 hours, but if you are
 looking for an immediate response, it might be in your best interest to come to office hours.
Spring 2019                                                                                                            Page 6


 Office Hours: Please come to office hours! I consider it a joy to talk one-on-one with my students. Office hours are a
 great place to ask questions, receive guidance, workshop an essay, or discuss a grade. Furthermore, coming to office
 hours helps your participation grade. If my office hours conflict with your schedule, please email me to set up an
 appointment. Always feel free to drop-in, but if you have an important matter to discuss, it might be best to email me
 beforehand. If my office hours become especially busy, I prioritize students with appointments.
 Food and Drink: I am more than fine with students bringing a drink or snack to class. Please do not let it become a
 distraction, and remember to throw away all trash before you leave the room.
 Finally—I truly am here to help each one of you learn and enjoy critical reading, writing, and the beauty and richness of Chicana literature
 and culture. My goal is for this course to be both a fun and rewarding experience. If you have any problems or concerns regarding this class,
 please do not hesitate to contact me or visit me in office hours. I am more than willing to help you out, and I look forward to getting to
 know each of you!
