Course Description:
This course is an introductory survey of Western European history, from about 300 to 1500 C.E.
Although textual sources are central to the study of history, we will also focus on visual and material
sources to discuss the cultural, social, political, economic, and intellectual history of the Middle Ages,
with a focus on the formation of identity. Note that much of the material in this class is religious in
nature. Classes will be a mixture of lecture and collaborative class discussions.
Objectives:
Learn to analyze and articulate meaning from primary sources created in the Middle Ages - both texts
        and material culture.
Learn to read critically and gain a broad understanding of European history.
Gain the ability to describe the major historical trends in the history of Western Civilization during the
        Middle Ages and their influence on current culture.
Become more aware of material culture and the significance of place/space both in the medieval and
        modern world.
Develop a deeper understanding of cultures and religious beliefs that may be different from our own.
        (Note that this course has a Global Cultures flag)
Acquire basic knowledge of the geography of Europe.
Required texts (available at the University Co-op):

Additional Class Policies and Notes:

        phone rings during class, I reserve the right to answer it.
    4. Attend all class meetings, arrive on time, and sign the daily sign-in sheet. After two absences,
        each subsequent unexcused absence subtracts 5 points from your class participation AND
        attendance grade. Excused absences require a note to the professor BEFORE class or within
        one week after the missed class.
    5. There will be NO make-ups on quizzes.
    6. Make-up exams will be made available IF you have a documented, excused absence on an exam
        day. Notify me as soon as you know you cannot take an exam as scheduled.

        semester, or at least fourteen days prior to the date of your absence.
    8. If you miss class, obtain notes from your classmates and come to office hours if you want to
        discuss what you have missed and go over Power point presentations.
    9. Please do not record lectures.
    10. You will be expected to treat others in the class with respect and to listen to their opinions.
    11. Practice academic integrity. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty
        (cheating, plagiarism, forging a classmate’s signature on the attendance roster etc.) are subject
        to disciplinary penalties, including failure of the course and/or dismissal from the University.

        evacuation procedures. When a fire alarm is sounded we must exit the building, proceed to the
