Canvas and readings
   There is no textbook for this course. However, I have assembled a packet of required
   readings (articles) for purchase at the McCombs Copy Center (GSB 3.136). For your
   convenience, I will also make readings available on Canvas (https://utexas.instructure.com),
   but it should be much easier for you to buy the packet than to than download and print
   everything from Canvas. I also use Canvas to post assignments and announcements, so
   please monitor the course Canvas site on a regular basis. I cannot be responsible for
   information that students miss even though it is posted prominently on Canvas.
   Please feel free to post questions or comments (or reply to others’ questions or comments) in
   the discussion board area of Canvas. I will reply to any reasonable question that does not get
   a reply from a fellow student before I get to it. Hence, if you have a question of general
   interest, please use the Canvas discussion board, not email. That way everyone benefits.
   All written assignments must be submitted electronically to Canvas no later than 1:45 p.m.
   on the assignment due date. The intent of this rule is to remove any incentive to complete
   the assignment after it is discussed in class. In addition, students are responsible for
   printing and handing in a hard-copy of each assignment in class on the due date. Failure
   to abide by these rules will result in a penalty to be determined by the instructor on a
   case-by-case basis.

     teaching?
5. What is research validity and what makes a study believable?
6. What is an interaction?
7. How do ethical principles bear upon sound research?
8. What examples of scientific-method accounting research are at the cutting edge in financial
     accounting, auditing, management accounting, and taxation?
9. What are the biggest needs for future accounting research?
10. At a basic level, how does one go about conducting an accounting research study?
Overview of Course Plan
    • We will cover objectives 1-7 in a traditional class format in the first month, but with
        ample opportunity for discussion. An examination over this material on Thursday,
        February 20 will be the only examination in this course.
    • After the exam on February 20, the remainder of the semester will be dedicated to course
        objectives 8 and 9, with an article each Tuesday to illustrate that week’s theme, followed
        by student discussion on Thursday to identify opportunities for future research.
    • Objective 10 (conducting research) will be covered by a research assignment involving an
        archival database and statistical testing, following instructions I will distribute later in the
        semester. It is due on the last day of class, May 7. This assignment serves in lieu of a
        final exam.

Evaluated Components and Grades
Your accountability for this course will be based on a 800-point scale, as follows:
                                                                      Points         Percentage of

    Research proposal 1 (see description later)                        100               12.5%

    End-of-semester research project                                   120               15.0%
    Class participation                                                160               20.0%
      Total points possible                                            800              100.0%
I do not establish point cutoffs for letter grades until the end of the semester, although I start by
considering the traditional 90% = “A”; 80% = “B” guidelines, with +/- grades awarded around
the borderlines -- particularly the A/B borderline. Depending on the overall point distribution at
the end of the semester, I reserve the right to use cutoffs that are more generous than the
traditional guidelines. Students should not count on this possibility, however, as my hope is that
it will not be necessary. My intent is to establish an overall grade-point average for this course
between 3.4 and 3.6 (where “A” = 4.0), consistent with guidance from the Department of
Accounting MPA Program Office regarding the expected grade distribution for a graduate-level
accounting elective.
While I expect to award several “A” and “A-” grades for a graduate-level elective in a program
as strong as ours, I also interpret such grades as exceptional performance. Thus, students who
meet but do not necessarily exceed my basic expectations for this course will typically receive a
“B+” or “B.” Grades of “B-” or worse in a graduate-level course are appropriate when a student
has not met expectations. My overall “expectation benchmark” is around 80% of the available
points, so to avoid a B- or worse, aim for at least 640 points. Please also note that severe
academic penalties, up to a failing grade in the course, can result from cases of scholastic
dishonesty.


ACC 380K.22 SYLLABUS (KACHELMEIER)                                                                  4
SPRING 2020
Plus/Minus Grading
I award +/- grades in an approximately “GPA neutral” manner. This means that I award plus or
minus grades for borderline cases (primarily at the A/B cutoff) in a way that does not
significantly alter the grade-point average for the class as a whole. Thus, the number of students
who get an A- instead of an A will be about the same as the number who get a B+ instead of a B.
Plus-minus grading simply allows a finer distinction between different levels of performance.
Descriptions of Evaluated Components
Mini-Assignments for the First Month (20 points total)
Four small assignments in January and February are intended to give you an incentive to keep up
with the readings when we cover research fundamentals at the beginning of the semester. These
mini-assignments, worth five points each, ask you to document an important question or
observation from each assigned introductory reading we cover during the first five weeks of
class. They should not take much time other than keeping up with the readings.
In-Class Examination over Research Fundamentals (120 points)
Thursday, February 20 is scheduled for an in-class examination over the background material on
research fundamentals that we cover during the first five weeks of the semester. The intent is to
give all students the background necessary to engage a meaningful evaluation of the research
articles we cover over the remainder of the semester.
Research Proposals (two proposals worth 100 points each, for a total of 200 points)
For the weeks following the exam on February 20, we will cover a different research theme each
week, with examples from recent articles in the accounting literature. Each Tuesday we will
cover an article illustrating that week’s theme. With two exceptions, the Thursday class will be
devoted to student proposals on research that could be conducted within the same theme, broadly
interpreted. The exceptions are Thursday, February 27, when I will present a proposal I wrote
myself to illustrate what I have in mind for your proposals, and Thursday, May 7, which is the
last day of class.
Each student will pick two of the eight available weeks to develop an individual research
proposal on that week’s theme. To avoid the problem of too many students picking the same
weeks, spaces for each week will be limited, available for selection on a first-come, first-served
basis via Canvas. For the students who select any given week, we will use the Thursday session
to discuss proposals on a volunteer basis. As described in more detail later, the basic structure of
each proposal will be to (1) specify the research question of interest, (2) identify three articles
relevant to the question, and (3) refine the research question and develop a basic design to
examine it. I do not expect students to conduct the research they propose, but proposals should
be specific enough to provide a reasonable idea of what would need to be done.


ACC 380K.22 SYLLABUS (KACHELMEIER)                                                                   5
SPRING 2020
Weekly Article Quizzes (180 points)
Beginning on Tuesday, March 3, each Tuesday session will begin with a 20-point quiz over the
article assigned for that day. The intent of these quizzes is to give you an incentive to read the
article before class, so that you can participate meaningfully in the class discussion. The first five
short-answer questions for each quiz will always be the same, as follows:
1. What is the primary research question addressed in this study?
2. In “Libby Box” format, what are the study’s primary independent and dependent constructs
   (i.e., the top two boxes) as well as its primary independent and dependent operational
   variables (i.e., the two bottom boxes)?
3. Name one insight from the findings that you believe is of particular practical importance.
4. Name one flaw or limitation of the study that you believe is of particular concern.
5. Name one thing from the article that you found particularly confusing.
These questions are worth six points in total. As these questions involve judgment and opinions,
several answers are acceptable as long as they show reasonable attentiveness to the question.
Thus, if you read the article and come prepared, you should be able to get all six of these points
in the vast majority of cases unless you significantly misunderstand the article.
The remaining fourteen points will consist of seven multiple choice questions worth two points
each. Questions will cover my sense of the most important aspects of the article, but they may
come from any part of the article. (Interpretation: Do not just read the introduction and assume
you have done enough.) In fairness, I will not base questions on details in tables or footnotes that
are not also reasonably covered in the article’s narrative. (Interpretation: I do not expect you to
memorize tables, so you may safely just “skim” the tables. I do expect you to read the article,
however, including its discussion of conclusions drawn from the tables.)
Of the ten quizzes, I will drop your lowest individual quiz score, even if that score is a zero.
Thus, the total score for this category will be based on nine quiz scores out of the ten quizzes
administered from Tuesday, March 3 through Tuesday, May 5, accounting for the total
maximum points available of 180 (= 9 × 20).
End-of-Semester Structured Research Project (120 points)
In lieu of a final exam, I will provide detailed instructions for a research exercise in which
students will access data from the Audit Analytics database to investigate the association
between internal control findings and audit fees, as well as whether the nature of this association
differs between Big-Four and non-Big-Four audit firms. The statistical analysis, which involves
multiple linear regression, can be done on Excel, as I will explain. Your completed project must
be uploaded to Canvas no later than 1:45 p.m. on Thursday, May 7, 2020, the last day of class. In
addition, students must bring a printed hard copy to turn in during class on May 7.


ACC 380K.22 SYLLABUS (KACHELMEIER)                                                                      6
SPRING 2020
Class Participation (160 points)
A discussion-oriented class can only succeed with your help. Accordingly, I maintain a daily log
to document the students who were the most helpful in each day’s discussion. More specifically,
after each class, I place each student to the best of my ability in one of five categories for that
day’s discussion:
Category 1: Did not attend and did not provide notification of an excused absence due to
              medical emergency, family emergency, religious holiday, or a conflict with a
              University-sponsored event. I also reserve the right to assign students to this
              category for disruptive and/or discourteous actions such as using cell phones when
              others are speaking, excessive tardiness, etc.
Category 2: Attended, but with no evidence of participation.
Category 3: Attended with at least some evidence of participation besides just attending.
Category 4: Attended with good evidence of participation.
Category 5: Attended with exceptional participation.
Notes:
    • Placement in Category 4 or 5 is not just based on the number of times you speak. Rather,
        I will do my best to monitor the quality of your comments. Even one comment in a class
        discussion can get you to Category 5 if it provides an exceptional insight that adds
        significantly to our understanding or offers an important new perspective.
    • I also take favorable note of students who comment meaningfully and constructively on
        other students’ proposals that we will discuss in March, April, and May.
    • For calibration, just attending class and doing nothing else all semester long will
        generally get you about half of the available participation points. I do not expect students
        to say something each and every day, but you should get in the habit of contributing your
        point of view rather than just listening to others.
    • The topics we discuss can sometimes be controversial, with differing points of view. I
        intend to conduct this class in an environment of mutual respect, where it is fine to
        disagree, but not to offend. Diversity of perspectives is a plus from which we all benefit.
    • Do your best to avoid Category 1, as unexcused absences will result in significant losses
        of participation points. Thus, at a very minimum, come to class. Students with an excused
        absence due to medical emergency, family emergency, religious holiday, or University-
        sponsored conflict are responsible for letting me know, along with providing appropriate
        documentation. Absences for recruiting purposes should be discussed with me in advance
        and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Students are responsible for working with
        recruiters (as recruiters promise us they will do) to avoid class conflicts if at all possible.
University Writing Center
If you struggle with written assignments, consider scheduling a free appointment with the
University Writing Center (UWC). UWC writing consultants can help you improve your writing
while preserving the integrity of your work. For further details, see https://uwc.utexas.edu.


ACC 380K.22 SYLLABUS (KACHELMEIER)                                                                  7
SPRING 2020
Policy on Notifications on Canvas and via Email
I frequently post announcements on Canvas, so please to monitor this resource before every
class. In addition, I will sometimes contact you by email, consistent with the UT-Austin
authorization of email for University communication. I typically use the email function on
Canvas, so please make sure you monitor that address. For more information, see:
https://cio.utexas.edu/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy.
Student Safety and the Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
Please see http://www.utexas.edu/safety to familiarize yourself with campus safety initiatives
and resources. Also see http://emergency.utexas.edu for emergency notifications. Regarding
behavioral issues, if you have concerns or are worried about someone who is acting differently,
consider using the UT-Austin Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss your concerns. This
service is provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the
Counseling and Mental Health Center, the Employee Assistance Program, and The University of
Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit https://besafe.utexas.edu/behavior-
concerns-advice-line. You are also welcome to discuss any concerns with me, but please see the
next paragraph regarding my responsibilities as a University of Texas at Austin faculty member.
Harassment and Faculty Responsibilities
While I welcome all conversations with students, please be aware that, by University policy,
State law, and Federal law, faculty members are required to report to the appropriate University
office any and all instances of possible sexual harassment, assault, violence, and stalking that
may come to the faculty member’s attention. Please see https://titleix.utexas.edu/sb212 for
further details. The reason for this requirement is to do everything we can to keep all members of
the University community safe and secure.
Policy on Missed Examinations and Assignments
My general policy is that medical emergencies, family emergencies, religious holidays, and
university-sponsored conflicts are the only valid reasons for missing an examination or
assignment due date. For each such case, I require some form of supporting documentation, such
as a signed note from a physician or a letter/note from the relevant University office. I will then
determine the best make-up alternative on a case-by-case basis, which could mean a make-up
exam, slightly extended due date, or recalculating the semester grade to omit the missed
component, depending on circumstances. Examinations or assignments that are missed for
reasons other than those indicated above will generally not be accepted. In the case of a conflict
due to a university-sponsored event or religious holiday, please notify me at least 14 days before
the examination date or assignment due date.


ACC 380K.22 SYLLABUS (KACHELMEIER)                                                                  8
SPRING 2020
Policy on Students with Disabilities
I comply with guidelines set forth by the UT-Austin Office of Services for Students with
Disabilities (http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/current-students/). If you have an SSD-registered
accommodation letter, please see me with your letter to discuss the accommodations you need
for this course. Please understand that I can provide accommodations only to students with
approved SSD letters. Students must inform me of any SSD-related requests at least 14 days in
advance in order to ensure that accommodations can be made.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty and Working Together on Course Assignments
Policy of the MPA Program
The Master in Professional Accounting Program has adopted a Code of Conduct, a Career
Services Code of Ethics, and a Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty. It is important for you
to be familiar with all three documents, which are available at
https://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/MPA/Student-Codes-of-Ethics
The following statement applies to each class in the UT-Austin Department of Accounting:
    The Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
    responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are
    described in detail in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty in the
    MPA Program (which includes the integrated five-year MPA program and the traditional
    MPA program). By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all faculty
    responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to
    observe all student responsibilities described in that document. If the application of that
    Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your
    responsibility to ask me for clarification.
In simple terms, integrity is a public good from which we all benefit. I view the MPA Code of
Ethics as a commitment to integrity, not as a threat. Accordingly, I intend to conduct this course
in a friendly environment of trust and cooperation, but I can only achieve this goal if you join me
in maintaining an atmosphere of absolute ethical integrity. As the top-rated professional
accounting program in the country, we cannot afford any less.
Personal Policy on Working Together (applies only to this course)
I believe that learning takes place through a healthy exchange of ideas. Therefore, for this class,
you are welcome to discuss articles and class assignments with other students. However, I expect
the final product of each assignment to reflect your individual effort. You may not copy or
paraphrase from others’ solutions. To clarify this policy, below are some examples from
situations I have encountered in prior years. In each case, I pursued a Scholastic Dishonesty
charge with the Dean of Students and imposed an appropriate penalty.


ACC 380K.22 SYLLABUS (KACHELMEIER)                                                                  9
SPRING 2020
• Student X completes an assignment before student Y. Y asks X for X’s solution. Y bases
  his/her completed assignment on X’s assignment, changing a few words here and there to make
  it look original. This is an example of plagiarism, which takes advantage of student X and does
  not evidence any meaningful learning on the part of student Y. Both X and Y are guilty of
  scholastic dishonesty.
  Please be aware that assignments submitted online via Canvas are subject to plagiarism-
  detection software. This software works by comparing submitted materials to a database of
  papers submitted by other students, as well as journals, essays, newspaper articles, books, and
  other published works. Other methods may also be used to determine originality. Plagiarism
  software does not substitute for the faculty member’s judgment regarding detection of
  plagiarism, but it is a tool that I use to maintain integrity on written assignments.
• A student copies from an article or other source without using quotation marks, indentation, or
  other references to acknowledge the source. This is another example of plagiarism.
• A student completes the end-of-semester research project and gives the completed Excel and/or
  Word file to another student. In this case, both students would be guilty of scholastic
  dishonesty.
• Collaboration or any other form of cheating on a course examination or quiz is scholastic
  dishonesty of the most severe variety, which can result in a significant academic penalty, up to
  the possibility of an “F” for the course.
For more information on University policies and procedures regarding scholastic dishonesty, see
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/index.php.
When in doubt, ask me.
If you have read this far, thank you! The fact that you read a nine-page syllabus shows that you
care about this class and want to succeed. History suggests that only about half of all students
even bother to read the entire syllabus, so I want to give you a small token of my appreciation for
being in that half. Accordingly, I set up an online link that will award you two class participation
points just for typing in your name, if you do so by Tuesday, January 28, 2020. Thanks! To get
your two points, go to: https://mccombs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3y2jhsCkZB6KT1X
