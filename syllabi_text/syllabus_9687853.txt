                                              Suicide Prevention
    I.       COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course will examine the public health problem of suicide, with specific attention to prevention, intervention,
and postvention related to micro, mezzo, and macro approaches. Students will gain an understanding of suicide
epidemiology and underlying theory, as well as risk and protective factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
This course will familiarize students with evidence-based practices and ethical considerations with clients
engaging in suicidal thoughts and behaviors, including learning directly from individuals with lived experience
with suicidality. Students will also learn about the current state and national strategies for suicide prevention, as
well as policies related to suicide. Upon completion of this course, based on the completion of all readings and
projects outlined in the syllabus, students will gain skills in assessment and management of suicide risk,
intervention and treatment techniques with suicidal clients, and postvention approaches with survivors of suicide
loss.
    II.      COURSE OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
    1. Understand the epidemiology and theories of suicide, as well as the various models of suicide prevention.
    2. Understand risk and protective factors (at multiple levels) for suicide and identify and understand which
        social groups are at high risk for suicide.
    3. Understand the importance of developing a therapeutic alliance for effectively working with suicidal
        clients.
    4. Demonstrate the ability to actively listen to suicidal clients.
    5. Demonstrate reflecting skills necessary to build rapport and trust with suicidal clients.
    6. Be able to critically evaluate, select, and apply evidence-based suicide risk screening and assessment.
    7. Understand, select and modify appropriate suicide intervention strategies based on continuous clinical
        assessment.
    8. Learn about development and implementation of interventions for individuals with suicidal thoughts and
        behaviors.
    III.     TEACHING METHODS
The Professor is committed to helping students prepare for social work field education. A variety of teaching
methods including interactive lectures, experiential group activities, reading assignments, guest speakers,
audiovisual materials, and student presentations will be used to help students understand suicide prevention at the
micro, mezzo, and macro levels. Students are expected to be the chairs of their own education, meaning they will
contribute to their own learning through asking questions, sharing experiences, and actively participating in class
discussion. In covering various topics, our class will intentionally discuss diversity based on gender, gender
                                                            1


identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, immigrant/documentation status, class, religion, varying
ability, and age. This course will highlight diverse perspectives of thought, and encourages students to engage in
new ways of thinking that may be represented by speakers, the professor, and classmates from diverse
backgrounds. If students do not believe they are getting what they desire to learn in class, the Professor strongly
suggests that the student meet with the Professor early on in the semester. The Professor welcomes these
conversations and cannot know if a student is struggling unless he/she/hir informs her.
Use of Canvas in Class & Email
In this class the Professor uses Canvas—a Web-based course management system with password-protected
access at http://canvas.utexas.edu—to distribute course materials, to communicate and collaborate online, to post
grades, to submit assignments, and to give students online quizzes and surveys. Students can find support in using
Canvas at the ITS Help Desk by calling 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Please plan
accordingly.
It is required that students check their email daily and respond within 24 hours when warranted. This is not only
preparing you for ethical and professional social work practice, but also affords effective communication between
you and the Professor.
     IV.      REQUIRED TEXT AND MATERIALS
See syllabus calendar for all required readings. There is no required text.
     V.       COURSE REQUIREMENTS
The assignments are designed to give each student the opportunity to demonstrate their learning over the semester
in a variety of ways including presentations, essays/papers, and in class debates/discussions.
Debates 40%
     -   20% in class debates
     -   20% written comments/questions
Students will receive a pro/con card at the beginning of every class based on the specific reading for that day.
Students are expected to be able to argue both sides for the “debate article” as it will also increase empathy to a
“side” you might not understand well. We will all read the required article for that day. While the other readings
are not mandatory, I do ask that you read at least one other article the help organize and inform your thoughts for
debates. As you read the ‘debate article’ please write a pro/con stance list with 3-5 comments for and against the
topic. This will be part of your grade and must be turned in before class (hard copy only). As the field of social
work specifically focuses on aspects of social justice or social determinates of care, please include those topics in
your debate and the one-page paper you turn into your professor. Please remember all papers must adhere to APA
or will be returned. For ease, you may use bullets for your pro/con list, but these bullets must be clear and concise
so that the professor can also understand your points.
Stakeholder Paper and Presentation 50% (due 7/24)
     -   25% Paper
     -   25% Presentation
A final project typically demonstrates your ability to relate all the information you’ve learned inside and outside
the class and apply it to a specific deliverable. Therefore, this project should reveal your knowledge of suicide
prevention and the stakeholders involved.
                                                             2


First, pick a group that is at heightened risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. You will then talk to stakeholders
from that group you would like to serve. Please note, a stakeholder does not include speaking to a social worker
at an agency. I would like you to speak to an individual who identifies as part of the group you are interested in
(for example, someone who identifies as a middle-aged man, a member of the LGBTQ community, family
members with lived experience of suicide, veterans, etc. You will first do research on a few prevention or
intervention programs that are currently used with the specific stakeholder group. When you meet with these
individuals (at least 3) you will describe briefly what each of the interventions or programs include and ask each
stakeholder their thoughts on what could be improved upon or changed with each program. You will then write a
paper and present to the class: 1) what are current interventions/programs for this specific group, and 2) a
synthesized list of stakeholders in one group or you can meet with them individually.
You will be working in groups of 2-3 students. Your paper will be 8-10 pages, APA format with the bulk of your
paper focused on what the stakeholders have said about the intervention(s) or program(s) and how you are going
to improve or change them. The final presentation will be 10-minutes in length and must include all group
members.
In addition to the group paper and presentation graduate students must choose from one of two options:
Option 1: Creating a one-page fact sheet/pamphlet or editorial to send to area agencies, policy advisors etc. that
represent their stakeholder base. Another option is the information provided will share what you found as a group,
what the agency is doing and recommendations for what else they could be doing. You will attach a cover sheet
to your one pager/pamphlet/editorial offering to present your findings at the agency.
I strongly encourage students to meet with me about their papers from conceptualization/brainstorming to rough
drafts. I have consistently found that students’ work is far superior with consultation.
Participation 10%
Do I have to attend class?
In a word, “yes”. Do you HAVE to, “no”. But students who attend class regularly perform better and attain
better grades than students who do not attend regularly.
I have a hard time getting to class on time, is that a problem?
Arriving to appointments on time not only shows your level of maturity, respect for your colleagues, and your
commitment to learning to become the best social worker you can be in your career. It also is a skill you must
achieve in the workforce to show respect for your colleagues and clients, but you will also represent your agency.
Finally, time management is also key to model for your clients. If you want them to be on time for their
appointment, you need to be on time as well.
Do you have an attendance sheet?
Yes. It will be distributed before class. Once class starts, I will take the attendance sheet. If you unfortunately
arrive late, you may sign the attendance sheet, but you will be marked late. Students with perfect attendance
(meaning they are here in class, stay the entire class time and arrive before class starts) will get 3 points added to
their final grade (i.e. they will likely raise their grade one letter grade).

    VII. CLASS POLICIES
Evaluation of students' performance is based on:
Assignments.
    • Most questions can be answered by reading the syllabus. If your question is not answered, your professor
        will further explain her expectations for assignments and specific grading criteria based on questions
        offered by students in class/via email and office hours. Each assignment is due on the date noted in the
        syllabus; any exception must be discussed in advance with your professor.
Class Participation.
    • You are responsible for completing all readings before class and being prepared to apply them in class
        discussions. Class discussion may include in-class discussions, debates, role-plays, and exercises. Class
        participation should reflect the social worker’s professional responsibility for respectful interactions and
        attentiveness with fellow students and faculty. Please review the student policy manual for SHSSW
        standards for professional development and the honor code.
Attendance, Attentiveness, and Punctuality.
    • Students are expected to let the professor know before class when they will be absent. This allows for the
        professor to change activities as needed.
    • Use of computers, phones, and other electronic devices are not allowed during class.
    • Please inform your instructor if you may be late and when late, enter the class quietly and with minimal
        disruption. Repeated lateness will influence evaluation of student performance.
Grading Policy
Evaluation of student performance in the class is based on:
Debates (40%)
Final Paper and Project (50%)

Grade Grievance Policy and Procedure.
      The instructor reserves the right to alter the course requirements and/or assignments based on new
                      materials, class discussions or other legitimate pedagogical objectives.
     VIII. UNIVERSITY POLICIES
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HONOR CODE. The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are
learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the
university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers
and community.
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND CIVILITY IN THE CLASSROOM. The professor expects students to
act as professionals in class. This means students should arrive on time for class, be prepared to participate in the
class discussion, and show respect for one another’s opinions. A course brings together a group of diverse
individuals with various backgrounds. Students are influenced and shaped by such factors as ethnicity, gender,
sex, physical abilities, religious and political beliefs, national origins, and sexual orientations, among others. We
expect to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. Social Work also
deals with complex and controversial issues. These issues may be challenging and uncomfortable, and it would be
impossible to offer a substantive classroom experience that did not include potentially difficult conversations
relating to challenging issues. In this environment we will be exposed to diverse ideas and opinions, and
sometimes we will not agree with the ideas expressed by others. Nevertheless, the professor requires that students
engage one another with civility, respect, and professionalism.
UNANTICIPATED DISTRESS. Students may experience unexpected and/or distressing reactions to course
readings, videos, conversations, and assignments. If so, students are encouraged to inform the professor. The
professor can be responsive and supportive regarding students’ participation in course assignments and activities,
but students are responsible for communicating clearly what kind of support is desired. If counseling is needed,
students may contact a service provider of their choosing, including the UT Counseling Center at 512-471-3515
or online at https://cmhc.utexas.edu/.
POLICY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION. Public social networks are
not private. Even when open only to approved or invited members, users cannot be certain that privacy will exist
among the general membership of sites. If social work students choose to participate in such forums, please
assume that anything posted can be seen, read, and critiqued. What is said, posted, linked to, commented on,
uploaded, subscribed to, etc., can be accessed and archived, posing potential harm to professional reputations and
prospective careers.
Social work students who use social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and other forms of electronic
communication (e.g. blogs) must be mindful of how their communication may be perceived by clients,
colleagues, faculty, and others. Social work students are expected to make every effort to minimize material
                                                             5


which could be considered inappropriate for a professional social worker in training. Because of this, social work
students are advised to manage security settings at their most private levels and avoid posting information/photos
or using any language that could jeopardize their professional image.
Students are asked to consider the amount of personal information posted on these sites and are obliged to block
any client access to involvement in the students’ social networks. Client material should not be referred to in any
form of electronic media, including any information that might lead to the identification of a client or compromise
client confidentiality in any way. Additionally, students must critically evaluate any material that is posted
regarding community agencies and professional relationships, as certain material could violate the standards set
by the School of Social Work, the Texas Code of Conduct for Social Workers, and/or the NASW Code of Ethics.
Social work students should consider that they will be representing professional social work practice as well as
The University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work program while in the classroom, the university
community, and the broader area communities.
POLICY ON SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty
are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies
on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, the student may refer to the Web Site
of the Student Judicial Services, Office of the Dean of Students: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.
USE OF COURSE MATERIALS. The materials used in this course, including, but not limited to exams,
quizzes, and homework assignments, are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized duplication of the course
materials is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary action being taken against the student.
Additionally, the sharing of course materials without the specific, express approval of the professor may be a
violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further
disciplinary action. This sharing includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the
purpose of distributing those materials to other current or future students.
DOCUMENTED DISABILITY STATEMENT. Any student who requires special accommodations must
obtain a letter that documents the disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Division of
Diversity and Community Engagement (471- 6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of
hearing). A student should present the letter to the professor at the beginning of the semester so that needed
accommodations can be discussed and followed. The student should remind the professor of any testing
accommodations no later than five business days before an exam. For more information, visit:
http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/.
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS. By UT Austin policy, students must notify the professor of a pending absence at
least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If the student must miss a class,
examination, work assignment, or project in order to observe a religious holy day, the professor will give the
student an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
TITLE IX REPORTING. TITLE IX REPORTING. In accordance with Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972, the University of Texas at Austin is committed to maintaining a learning environment that
is free from discriminatory conduct based on gender. Faculty, field instructors, staff, and/or teaching assistants in
their supervisory roles are mandated reporters of incidents of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual
violence, stalking, interpersonal violence, or any other forms of sexual misconduct. Students who report such
incidents will be informed of University resources. Incidents will be reported to the University’s Title IX
Coordinator and/or the Title IX Liaison for the SHSSW, Professor Tanya Voss. Students, faculty and staff may
                                                           6


contact Professor Voss to report incidents or to obtain information. Further information, including student
resources related to Title IX, may also be found at http://socialwork.utexas.edu/dl/files/academic-
programs/other/qrg-sexualharassment.pdf.
CAMPUS CARRY POLICY. The University’s policy on concealed fire arms may be found here:
https://campuscarry.utexas.edu. You also may find this information by accessing the Quick Links menu on the
School’s website.
CLASSROOM CONFIDENTIALITY. Information shared in class about agencies, clients, and personal matters
is considered confidential per the NASW Code of Ethics on educational supervision and is protected by
regulations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) as well. As such, sharing this information
with individuals outside of the educational context is not permitted. Violations of confidentiality could result in
actions taken according to the policies and procedure for review of academic performance located in sections 3.0,
3.1, and 3.2 of the Standards for Social Work Education.
USE OF E-MAIL FOR OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE TO STUDENTS. Email is recognized as an
official mode of university correspondence; therefore, students are responsible for reading their email for
university and course-related information and announcements. Students are responsible for keeping the university
informed about a change of e-mail address. Students should check their e-mail regularly and frequently—daily,
but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related communications, some of which may be
time-sensitive. Students can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating their e-mail address at
https://cio.utexas.edu/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy.
SAFETY. As part of professional social work education, students may have assignments that involve working in
agency settings and/or the community. As such, these assignments may present some risks. Sound choices and
caution may lower risks inherent to the profession. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of and adhere to
policies and practices related to agency and/or community safety. Students should notify the professor regarding
any safety concerns.
BEHAVIOR CONCERNS ADVICE LINE (BCAL). If students are worried about someone who is acting
differently, they may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone their concerns about another
individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a partnership between the Office of the Dean of Students,
the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University
of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
EMERGENCY EVACUATION POLICY. Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to
evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the
following policies regarding evacuation:
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors in the classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest exit door
may not be the one you used when entering the building.
If you require assistance to evacuate, inform the professor in writing during the first week of class.
In the event of an evacuation, follow the professor’s instructions.
Do not re-enter a building unless you are given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police
Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
