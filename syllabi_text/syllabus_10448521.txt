Course Description
New York City has long been a proving ground for leaders eager to show that, “If I can make it there, I’ll
make it anywhere.” As a world capital of the arts, diplomacy, finance, and media, the city serves as
home to many highly successful leaders and as a classroom for people seeking to cultivate leadership
skills. In this course, topics include, but are not limited to: theories of leadership, psychological and
emotional elements of leadership, power and influence, ethics, management, and the future of
leadership—all situated within the larger context of New York City.
Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
          • Apply, analyze, and reflect upon learned principles as they relate to development of the self
              as a leader, including articulating their own philosophy of leadership.
          • Explore the nature of social problems that leaders face in order to facilitate meaningful
              change.
          • Express their ideas about leadership and related topics both in writing and in presentation
              (i.e., perform leadership and management skills).
          • Demonstrate their ability to enact contemporary leadership concepts, practice, and theories
              to the urban environment in which the student aspires to serve professionally.

        informational interviews with professionals in the NYC (or tri-state) area.
Grading
Only letter grades, not plus/minus increments, are used in this course. Your grade will be determined by
the accumulation of points for course components (see below), not by averages/means. Grades are
determined on a straight percentage scale based on the number of points earned out of a maximum of
500 points. There will be no further rounding or curving of grades. Final grades are calculated as follows:
        A   =        89.5%-100%         (447.5-500)
        B   =        79.5%-89.49%       (397.5-447.4)
        C   =        69.5%-79.49%       (347.5-397.4)
        D   =        59.5%-69.49%       (297.5-347.4)
        F   =        below 59.5%        (0-297.4)

Discussion of Graded Assignments
University procedure for a grade contestation begins with a student and the instructor. A student
wishing to contest a grade must present his/her/their instructor with a typed, well thought out case
regarding the evaluation within one week of having received the evaluation, but not before 24 hours
have passed. The case must be related to the assignment as presented, and based on how it compares
with the criteria for the assignment (not how it compares with someone else’s work or how it will affect
a student’s GPA). Once the student has submitted his/her/their argument to the instructor, the
instructor will respond in writing within 7 days. Student and instructor then may meet to review the
                                                                                                          2


assignment in question, and discuss ways to improve future assignments. Instructors are available for
office hours and can assist you with assignments.
Policies
        Due dates and late work. Assignments turned in after the date and time posted on Canvas are
        considered late. Late assignments will be penalized with a 10% deduction per 24 hours.
        Assignments will not be accepted after one week beyond the due date. If you miss an in-class
        activity for participation points, you will earn a zero (unless you have a university excused
        absence).
        Schedule changes. Changes to the schedule may be made at your instructor’s discretion and if
        circumstances require it. It is your responsibility to note these changes when announced.
        Respect. People and ideas must be treated with respect. Please avoid disruptive behavior that
        makes it difficult to accomplish our mutual objectives. Racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic, and
        otherwise disrespectful language will not be tolerated. Remain engaged and attentive (i.e., eye
        contact, not on phone, not working on anything else) in the case of guest speakers. Be on time.
        Failure to demonstrate respect with result in a loss of participation points.
        Religious or holy days. A student wishing to observe a religious holy day must notify the
        instructor in writing at least 14 days prior to the classes scheduled on dates the student will be
        absent. For religious holy days that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, notice should
        be given on the first day of the semester. Other absences may be excused according to
        University policy. If you must miss something in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be
        given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
        Absences, drops, incompletes, withdrawals. If you begin to struggle at any point during the
        semester due to personal reasons (unforeseen events like family emergencies, a significant
        illness, etc), please speak with your academic advisor ASAP. The University has many options to
        help students, ranging from Q-drops and reduced workloads (reducing the number of hours you
        are enrolled in) to incompletes (this option is NOT available if you are failing a course) and
        withdrawals. The sooner you let your advisor know when something is wrong, the sooner (and
        better) the University can help you.
        Accessibility. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute
        that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other
        things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning
        environment including accommodations. The University of Texas at Austin offers support
        services for students with documented disabilities. A student with a disability should inform the
        instructor after requesting an Accommodation Letter from the Services for Students with
        Disabilities Office: 512.471.6259 (phone); ssd@austin.utexas.edu (email). Website:

        Title IX Reporting: Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of
        Texas universities, including faculty, to report any information to the Title IX Office regarding
        sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas
        law requires that all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including,
        but not limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be
        reported. If you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without
        making an official report to the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more
        information about reporting options and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact
        the Title IX Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512-471-0419. Although graduate
        teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still mandatory
        reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we
        refer to as sexual misconduct, including the types of sexual misconduct covered under Texas
        Senate Bill 212.The Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to survivors and
        compiled campus resources to support survivors.
