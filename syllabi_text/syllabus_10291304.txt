Course Objectives:
The objective of this class is to build and strengthen mentoring and leadership skills and provide Gateway
Mentors a solid foundation of experience and knowledge that can be applied to classroom facilitation and
mentorship in Spring 2020. Student mentors will develop skills to be effective mentors with intent to
provide ongoing academic, personal, and professional support to other students.
Class Expectations:
    1. Be in class on time. We will start promptly at 7:00 PM.
    2. Attendance is mandatory and will be recorded.
    3. Put away all technology during class unless otherwise instructed.
    4. Be engaged, ask questions, and use this class as an opportunity to learn and network with your
         fellow peers and in-class presenters.
Suggested Readings*:
Newton, F. B., & Ender, S. C. (2010). Students helping students : a guide for peer educators on college
campuses.
Rowley, B. (2006). Becoming a high-performance mentor : a guide to reflection and action
*The majority of the material of covered in the course comes from these two texts. YOU WILL NOT BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR READING them throughout the semester. However, if you are interested in the
course material and wish to further develop your skills as a student mentor these books will serve as a
reference.
Assignments and Grading:
Your grade for this course will be based upon the criteria listed below:
    1. Participation/Attendance (70%): Mentors are expected to fully participate by engaging in
    discussions during each class. Each class attendance is worth 5% of your total grade (14 classes x 5%
    = 70% of total grade). If you are absent on the day that your class meets, you are responsible for
    providing your TA with the necessary information to compensate for your absence. It is crucial to


    keep in communication; you are responsible for letting us know if you cannot make it to a class. You
    are allowed two unexcused absences in this course before having a one-one meeting in regards to
    your position.
             § Excused Absence: The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious
                 holidays or extenuating circumstances due to an emergency. If you plan to miss class due
                 to observance of a religious holiday, please let us know at least two weeks in advance.
                 You will not be penalized for this absence, although you will still be responsible for any
                 work you will miss on that day if applicable. Check with us for details or arrangements.
    2. Resource Presentation (25%): Students will develop two trainings for their fellow student mentors
    and future mentees. The trainings could expand on topics discussed throughout the semester or can be
    original topics that could potentially be useful when mentoring students involved in the Gateway
    Scholars Program. This will serve as preparation for event planning responsibilities in Fall 2020.
        § (1) Training presentation will be an in-class presentation ranging from 8-10 minutes. This
             presentation is to develop public speaking skills and should focus on campus resources.
             Topics should include but not limited to syllabus guest speakers.
        § (2) Students are expected to create a multimedia visual based off student success topics (i.e.
             academic, diversity and inclusion, cultural, professional development, health and wellness,
             community service, and others). (Due Dates: March 13, May 1)
    3. End of Semester Assessment (5%): Mentors are expected to complete and submit an end of
    semester feedback for the course. This will be administered during class time.
Grade Cutoffs:
Grades will be calculated using the scale below:
A - 90% - 100%
B - 80% - 89%
C - 70% - 79%
D - 60% - 69%
F – 0% - 59%

Accommodations for students with disabilities:
UT provides appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities upon request.
If you have a physical or learning disability and you wish to have accommodations, please notify your
teaching assistant immediately. You must also notify Services for Students with Disabilities office in SSB
4.206 before accommodations can be made.
Personal Pronoun Preference: Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect
to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation,
gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to instructors with the student’s
legal name. We will gladly honor your request to address you by a name different than what appears on
the roster, and by the gender pronouns you use. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester
so that we may make appropriate changes to our records.
Academic Integrity: University standards regulating academic integrity are strictly enforced. Plagiarism is
a serious offense in this and all courses. It is always necessary to identify the original source of supporting
information; you must cite the source of any material, quoted or paraphrased, that is used in your
presentation.
Religious Holy Days: A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations
for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructors in advance.
University Writing Center: You are strongly encouraged to use the services offered by the University
Writing Center. The UWC offers 45-minute, one-on-one consultations with UT students on any piece of
writing. You may visit up to three times per assignment and are encouraged to visit within forty-eight
hours of the due date. The consultants are well trained, and the cost of the service is covered in your
tuition. You can visit the UWC in either PCL 2.330 or the LCAE offices in SSB 4.400. If you wish to
make an appointment, you may do so through either uwc.utexas.edu or 471-6222.

consultation, and prevention services that facilitate students’ academic and life goals and enhance their
personal growth and well-being. If you need any services, please visit cmhc.utexas.edu or, from 8A to 5P,

Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and
cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety
or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual harassment,
sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational
institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
     1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.


     2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
         become involved in a Title IX investigation.
     3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory
Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator.
 I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents
 that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or
staff member about a Title IXrelated incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If
you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the
university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and
resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
