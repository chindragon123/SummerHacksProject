Required Readings
    1. **Canvas Readings
Suggested Texts
    1. *Belgrave, F. Z., & Allison, K. W. (2014). 3rd Edition. African American Psychology:
            From Africa to America. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.
    2. *Cokley, K. (2014). The Myth of Black Anti-Intellectualism: A True Psychology of
            African American Students. Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger Publications.
Required: Students are required to go to the link of the Journal of Black Psychology (JBP) at
http://jbp.sagepub.com/ to read psychological research related to people of African descent.
Course Description:
This course is an introduction to understanding the psychology of people of African descent. The
course examines the psychology of people of African descent using an African-centered
(Afrocentric) liberatory conceptual model. Alternative conceptual models of African/Black
psychology will also be examined. Topics that will be covered in the course include Ancient


African philosophical underpinnings of African/African American psychology, the psychological
impact of enslavement, Black/African/African American identity and personality development,
psychological issues in educating Africans/African Americans, aggression, violence, crime,
mental health, and the psychological impact of hip hop.
This course is reading intensive; therefore, it is critically important that all assigned readings are
completed prior to each class in order that a high-level, scholarly discussion will ensue. The
nature of the topics addressed in this course is such that rote lecturing is deemed by me to be
inappropriate. The course is thus designed primarily as a seminar where class discussion is
expected. I will only lecture in instances when the material is particularly challenging. I expect
that you will come prepared every class to engage in a focused exchange of ideas related to the
various readings. I will facilitate these exchanges, making appropriate commentary as necessary.
Course Objectives: Upon completion of this course you will be able to:
        1. Demonstrate knowledge of the historical roots of African psychology from an
        African-centered (Afrocentric) perspective and be able to identify the development of
        African American/Black psychology as a distinct system of psychological thought
        2. Demonstrate an understanding of the major terms and concepts of African-centered
        (Afrocentric) psychology. This includes the Africentric worldview, African self-
        consciousness, MAAT, Maafa, the extended self, and Sankofa.
        3. Demonstrate a critical awareness and understanding of the major models of
        African/Black identity, personality, and psychological functioning. These models include
        Cross’s Nigrescence theory and Kambon’s African Self-Consciousness theory.
        4. Conceptualize and critique issues impacting all Africans in the diaspora using
        an African-centered psychological framework.
        5. Explore your thoughts, values, and beliefs (i.e., worldview) as they relate to
        psychological and social experiences.
Course Requirements:
1.      Student should come PREPARED TO EVERY CLASS having read daily class
        readings.
2.      There will be 3 REACTION PAPERS. These reaction papers should be 2 full pages,
        double-spaced using Time New Roman 12 pt font and will be based on your personal
        reaction to the videos. These papers should not just be summaries of the videos. The
        grading criteria for the reaction papers will be as follows:
                5 points        clarity, organization, and grammatically correct; proofread!
                5 points        adequacy of factual information presented; quality of personal
                                reactions (i.e., superficial vs. substantive)
                                example of superficial comments: “I liked the video because it
                                was deep. It took place in Africa and showed that all Africans


                                   don’t look alike.”
                                   example of substantive comments: “I really enjoyed this video
                                   because it forced me to examine some of my deeply-ingrained,
                                   negative thoughts about Africans.”
      Grading rubic for reaction papers is online on Canvas under the modules link.
3.    There will be 6 pop quizzes. Each quiz will consist of five multiple choice questions
      which will cover readings due for the day. The questions will address the following areas:
      1.       What was the author’s philosophical orientation in terms of school of thought
               (i.e., traditional, reform, or radical)?
      2.       What issues did the author discuss? What were the author’s beliefs?
4.    The personal growth paper should reflect how (if at all) the class has impacted
      you. What did you learn? Do you see things differently?
5.    Go to the link of the Journal of Black Psychology at
      http://jbp.sagepub.com/. Click on either Current Issue (for articles in the most current
      issue), “All Issues” (to look through all issues of previously published journals), or scroll
      down to OnlineFirst and click View More (for articles that have been accepted for
      publication but are not in print yet). Choose a research article (i.e., quantitative or

Do NOT ask me for an extra point if you are borderline (e.g., 139, 159, 179) to boost your grade.
Attendance & Participation:
You are expected to attend and be prepared for every class period. Class discussion is usually
based on the readings in the course. Therefore, you are expected to be an INFORMED
participant in class discussion. You are allowed three unexcused absences for the course. After
the third absence, you must provide valid documentation explaining your absence. This
documentation must be approved by Dr. Cokley. More than 3 unexcused absences will affect
your final grade:
Fourth Unexcused Absence: Loss of one letter grade (The best grade you can make in the course
is a “B”)
Fifth Unexcused Absence: Loss of two letter grades (The best grade you can make in the course
is a “C”


Sixth Unexcused Absence: Loss of three letter grades (The best grade you can make in the
course is a “D”
Seventh Unexcused Absence: Automatic grade of “F”
If you are absent on the day of a pop quiz, you will be allowed three opportunities (no
documentation needed) to make up the pop quiz. If absent more than three times, you will
receive a 0 for each quiz (unless you have an excused absence from a doctor or some other
authority, or unless you can document circumstances related to a personal tragedy).
More than 5 unexcused absences may result in an individual final exam (professor discretion).
Religious Holidays:
Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If you miss an
examination, work assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day you
will be given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the
absence. It is the policy of The University of Texas at Austin that you must notify each of your
instructors at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to
observe a religious holy day.
Policies

Academic Integrity
You and other students are expected to "maintain absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in
scholastic work" undertaken at the University (Sec. 11-801, Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities).
This is a very basic expectation that is further reinforced by the University's Honor Code. At a minimum, you should
complete any assignments, exams, and other scholastic endeavors with the utmost honesty, which requires you to:
(1) acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts; (2) complete your assignments
independently unless expressly authorized to seek or obtain assistance in preparing them; (3) follow instructions for
assignments and exams, (4) observe the standards of your academic discipline and (5) avoid engaging in any form of
academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another student.

each course. The readings that do not come out of the Belgrave and Allison text and the Cokley text are posted on
Canvas. You will be responsible for checking the Canvas course site regularly for class work and announcements.
As with all computer systems, there are occasional scheduled downtimes as well as unanticipated disruptions.
Notification of these disruptions should be posted on the Canvas login page. Scheduled downtimes are not an
excuse for late work. However, if there is an unscheduled downtime for a significant period of time, I will make an
adjustment if it occurs close to the due date. Canvas is available at http://courses.utexas.edu. Support is provided by
the ITS Help Desk at 475-9400 Monday through Friday 8 am to 6 pm, so plan accordingly.

checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your
e-mail address are available at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html.In this course e-mail will be used
as a means of communication with students. You will be responsible for checking your e-mail regularly for class

Disabilities:
Students with disabilities who require special accommodations need to get a letter that documents the disability from
the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of the Dean of Students (471-6259 voice or 471-4641)
TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). This letter should be presented to the instructor in each course at
the beginning of the semester and accommodations needed should be discussed at that time. Five business days
before an exam the student should remind the instructor of any testing accommodations that will be needed. See
