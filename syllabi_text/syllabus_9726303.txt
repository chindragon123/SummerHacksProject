The term pan-Americanism has, for more than century, problematically evoked
intra-hemispheric solidarity based on supposedly common shared colonial ties,
geopolitical imperatives, business interests, and other discourses of trust, friendship
or propinquity linking different states, parties and other entities within the region.
This new graduate seminar will work from the premise that the pan-American
paradigm has guided much more US and especially Latin American intellectual and
cultural production than has generally been acknowledged. Accordingly, we will
interrogate diverse cultural practices in light of recent scholarship shedding
important new light on the concept. Through an analysis of both canonical and
marginal texts from different media-- print culture, cinema, popular music,
photography, and other cultural practices--the course will draw out and carefully
study hegemonic as well as critical expressions of hemispherism: from foundational
texts of the 19th and early 20th centuries (Bolívar, Monroe, Sousândrade, Martí,
Rodó, et al) to Hollywood "Good Neighbor" films and Brazilian chanchadas [musical
comedies]; from state-sponsored radio broadasts and advertising campaigns to anti-
imperial pop art, free jazz, and protest music and poetry of the 1960s and 1970s.
We will be especially attentive to the postcolonial concept of Global Americanity
(Saldívar), and to political, racial, and sexual spaces of dissidence within pan-
American and pan-Latin American literary movements, cultural projects, and other
related organizations and expressions.
This course is designed to develop theoretical and analytical tools related to cultural
and postcolonial studies from a (mostly) global South/Latin Americanist
perspective. It is meant to appeal to a fairly broad array of Latin Americanists and
US Americanists from different disciplines across the humanities. At the same time,
we will cover many literary and cultural works that should be of use to PhD
students in Latin American and Iberian Literatures and Cultures.
Final grades will be based on regular class participation, three oral presentations,
and a final research paper. Reading knowledge of Spanish and Portuguese is
required. Though written work for this course may be submitted in Spanish,
Portuguese, or English, the seminar will be conducted primarily in English.
