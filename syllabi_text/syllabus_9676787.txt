Course Description:
This course considers the social and cultural foundations of western medicine, and introduces
students to indigenous and alternative health systems. The course also considers the linkage
between modern medicine and the construction of modern subjectivity and personhood, and
analyzes local and global health disparities based on social, political, and economic inequalities.
In this course students will develop an understanding of the cultural and historical construction of
health, illness, race, gender, the body, subjectivity, and personhood. You will be introduced to the
history of the biomedical model of health and illness, and will develop an awareness of alternatives
to the biomedical model. You will develop an understanding of the social, cultural, political, and
economic context of contemporary health systems and health disparities, both locally and
internationally. You will develop an understanding of the ethical principles embedded in the
biomedical and alternative models of health and illness, as well as some of the ethical dilemmas
faced by patients, caregivers, and practitioners.
This course carries a Global Cultures flag. It may also count towards the certificate in Native
American and Indigenous Studies (with the completion of an individual project on an indigenous
issue; please consult the instructor for requirements). Finally, it has been designed for a new
Bridging Disciplines certificate in Patients, Practitioners, and Cultures of Care that is currently in
the approval process.
Learning Objectives:
    • Students will develop an understanding of the cultural and historical construction of health,
         illness, race, gender, the body, subjectivity, and personhood.
    • Students will become aware of the history of the biomedical model of health and illness.
    • Students will develop an awareness of global alternatives to the biomedical model as well as
         essentials of cross-cultural communication (i.e., cultural competence).
    • Students will develop an understanding of the social, political, and economic context of
         health systems and health disparities, both locally and globally (i.e., structural competence).
    • Students will develop an understanding of the ethical concepts embedded in the biomedical
         and alternative models of health and illness, and their implications for ethical reasoning and
         decision-making by patients, family caregivers, and healthcare providers.
    • Students will learn the perspectives of the fields of medical anthropology and global health
         to questions of culture and health.
    • Students will learn the contributions of ethnographic fieldwork, analysis, and comparison to
         our understanding of human health, illness, and healing.


Course Requirements:
This is a fast-paced course and students must keep up with the readings and assignments in order
to succeed. You are required to attend class regularly and to participate fully in class discussions.
You are expected to read the assigned material carefully prior to class and will take turns
facilitating class discussions (see guidelines posted on Canvas). Absences will be reflected in the
final grade. There will be weekly quizzes; no make-ups are available, but the lowest grade will be
dropped. There are also two short papers. Except in the case of a serious illness or emergency, all
work must be completed on time in order to receive credit.
Assignments:
    • Paper 1: A paper of 750-1000 words summarizing, applying and evaluating the four
         approaches to health care ethics discussed in Reimagining Global Health, chapter 9
         (utilitarianism, liberal cosmopolitanism, capabilities approach, human rights framework) as
         well as principalism as discussed by Gillon (1994). The paper should clearly and
         thoughtfully delineate and assess the five approaches, showing how they help you think
         through a specific bioethical dilemma found in our readings. What are the advantages and
         disadvantages of each approach? Do you find one of them clearly superior to the others?
         Why? You may (but are not required to) use additional sources. All quotations must be
         thoroughly documented, following MLA, APA, or Chicago Style. Your paper must be double-
         spaced and have a heading, an informative title, and a bibliography. Paper 1 must be turned
         in on Canvas by Sunday, August 4, at 11:59 pm.
    •    Paper 2: There are several possible formats for Paper 2. In either case, the format and
         length should be as described for Paper 1. Paper 2 must be turned in on Canvas by Sunday,
         August 18, at 11:59 pm.
             o Expanding on our discussion of the narrative construction of health and illness,
                  write a narrative concerning an experience of illness that you or a family member
                  have had. If you write the narrative of another person, you must obtain written
                  permission from the person to conduct an interview and submit the narrative, for
                  educational purposes only. The narrative should conclude with an analysis, using
                  some of the concepts discussed in class (for example, the experience of illness vs. the
                  biomedical concept of disease, health care disparities, ethical principles in health
                  care, etc.).
             o Alternatively, compare, contrast, and evaluate the three ethnographies we have
                  read: Fresh Fruits, Broken Bodies; Syndemic Suffering; and Lissa. What are the aims of
                  each ethnography, and what are the strengths of each? How does each ethnography
                  address the relationship between culture and health? Which ethnography do you
                  think is most successful and enlightening, and why?
             o Graduate students, medical students, and students wishing to count the course
                  towards the certificate in Native American and Indigenous Studies should confer
                  with the instructor about requirements for Paper 2.
