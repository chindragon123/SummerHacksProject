COURSE DESCRIPTION & OBJECTIVES:
On December 5, 2013, the world mourned the loss of an international icon: Nelson
Mandela. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's anti-
apartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward a multiracial
government and majority rule. His story is certainly one that is rooted in South African
political history. Yet his life, especially after enduring twenty-seven years of unjust
imprisonment, captivated the world. He was revered as a champion of human rights and
racial equality. As the former president of South Africa and a recipient of the Nobel peace
prize, he became fixed in public consciousness as a remarkable model of supreme tolerance,
generosity, grace, and reconciliation. This course relies on the personal and political history
of Nelson Mandela to examine the history of modern South Africa. It seeks to unpack the
Mandela as a mythical figure by examining some of the key experiences that shaped him as a
man, revolutionary, and respected elder statesman. It will draw heavily on an array of
primary evidence ranging from Mandela’s own writings, to government reports,
contemporary newspaper articles and books, as well as popular art, films, and music. It
critically traces his development across a range of issues from resistance strategies, gender,
Pan-Africanism, multiracialism, and nonviolence in order to give life to one of the most
powerful and inspiring stories of the 20th century.

                                 Description of Assignments
Participation & Attendance (Total: 15 points)
African history in a broad sense is very likely unfamiliar and even foreign to you. This means
attendance at every class is among the minimum requirements for success. It will be incredibly
difficult for you to do well in this class if you do not attend the lectures regularly. Successful
students rely on lecture notes alongside the text. Successful students also come to class
prepared and ready to actively engage all assigned texts. This requires reading and reflecting
on the text as well as being prepared to pose relevant questions, provide comments, and
feedback on the reading for each class period. In other words, you must have an active voice
in the class. We will employ various strategies to encourage your participation beyond simply
speaking-up in class. You can always actively ignite and join discussions via the discussion
forum on Canvas. Plan on submitting at least one thoughtful question or comment at least
every two weeks to ensure your participation. You are also welcomed and encouraged to use
social media to discuss various components of the course (be prepared to share your posts
and tweets with your classmates as well as with me). Nevertheless, each student is allowed
three unexcused absences during the course of the semester. Each additional (unexcused)
absence will result in a 5-point deduction from your final grade.
*Absences Due to Athletics or University Activities
Any athlete competing for UT on an NCAA or club level team needs to notify me as soon as
possible about any absences. Written documentation from the Athletic department will be
required for accommodations to be given.
                                                                                                 2


                                                                                           Syllabus
                                                                                         AFR374C
Quizzes (Total: 10 points)
There will be several quizzes that cover major concepts, definitions, and ideas at various
moments in the semester (most will be unannounced with the exception of the map quiz).
The purpose of these quizzes is to highlight important aspects of the course that will be
reflected in both the midterm examination and the take home final examination.
*Map Quiz
All students will be expected to be familiar with the cities, towns and regions, that we will
study this semester. The list of all of these categories will be provided early in the semester
to get students acclimated to the geography of South Africa.
Short Reflection Papers (Total: 50 points)
Students are required to write a total of four short essays throughout the course of the
semester on assigned readings. Two of the papers must be submitted before the midterm
and two after the midterm.
 These essays MUST:
            (1.) Provide a BRIEF overview of the book.
            (2.) Clearly identify and articulate the major argument(s) or narrative of the text
            being analyzed.
            (3.) Explain how the text informs, challenges, and/or expands your understanding
            of the particularities of South African history, by using specific examples and
            details.
            (4.) Make connections between the text and other course materials (lectures, other
            readings, documentaries, etc.)
Essays must be a MINIMUM 2 pages (no more than 3 pages) in length, typed (in 12-point
font), double-spaced with standard 1” margins. They must also be free of grammatical
errors/typos and use proper citation techniques specific to your discipline (if this is unknown,
please use parenthetical references similar to MLA-style – consult the Purdue Online Writing
Lab for examples http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/ or raise your concerns with me in class
so that this technique can be briefly reviewed).
Midterm Examination (Total: 25 points)
There will be an in-class midterm exam part way through the semester. We will discuss the
format as well as sample questions in class together. All your answers to this exam must be entirely
of your own making. Working with someone else on the exam in any way will be interpreted as academic
dishonesty and will be reported.
NOTE: You will not have opportunities for extra credit for borderline grades. Make sure
you have earned the necessary points. No changes will be made to a grade unless an
incorrect grade was assigned due to a mathematical/mechanical error. I also recommend that
students keep a copy of ALL work that I grade and return to them in the event that there is
a problem with a student’s final grade at the end of the semester.
                                                                                                  3
