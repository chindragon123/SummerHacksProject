Course Description.
The importance of brand storytelling continues to grow with new modes of message sharing. As more brands move to a story/content
marketing approach, this class shows students how to create tomorrow’s engaging, sharable content. The course examines how classic
elements of storytelling, semiotics, and symbolism can be used to create and manage a modern brand’s story and “meaning.” Students will
create visual, verbal, and video examples of brand storytelling that go beyond traditional advertising and PR.
Course Outcomes.
By the end of this course, you should demonstrate an understanding of:
    Integrated Branding: How to analyze, construct, and manage meaning for brands in all media

    Storytelling: Ability to use various timeless aspects of story to create brand messages
    Craft: How well a message is conceptualized, designed, and constructed
Coursework.
You'll create projects to help learn the theoretical fundamentals as well as practical skills of creating modern brand messages, plus tests to
ensure you understand these fundamentals. Weekly Projects are graded on a simple 5-point scale. These projects allow you freedom to
demonstrate your growing skills, and can be graded more subjectively than the tests. (In other words, your creative decisions play a bigger
role in this grade, and sheer amount of work put into a project does not always correlate with the final output. This is ultimately a solution-
oriented class, and there aren't always clear "right or wrong" answers--only better or weaker solutions.)
Grades.
Here’s how your final course grade will be calculated:
55% = 11 Projects (5% each)
45% = 3 Tests (15% each)
Final letter grades are calculated according to these cutoffs—no exceptions:
A = 94 to 100 A- = 90 to <94 B+ = 87 to <90 B = 87 to <84 B- = 84 to <80 C+ = 80 to <77 C = 77 to <74 C- = 74 to <70 D+ = 70 to <67
 D = 67 to <64 D- = 64 to <61 F = 61 to 0
Policies:
Late Work
As a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry, you are expected to complete every project on time – no exceptions. All projects are
due on Canvas at the date and time indicated on the Class Calendar.
Emergencies happen, so you are allowed one “Late Pass” without penalty, which gives you an additional 2 days (48 hours) to complete a
single Project. Thereafter, you will not be able to turn in any late projects under any circumstances, unless you already have a prior
exemption for a Religious Holy Day, a school-sponsored trip, or a doctor's note, obituary, or other serious issue that you can document with a
written excuse.

Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the
course and / or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University,
policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, please visit the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity
website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct           (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct) .
E-Mail
In this course, e-mail will be used as a means of communication. Please specify your class (don't worry about your EID) in e-mails--your prof
teaches multiple large classes. Also, please use the @utexas e-mail instead of the Canvas Inbox, since we are more likely to receive it on
any device. You will be responsible for checking your e-mail regularly for class work and announcements, as well as Canvas. You can find UT
Austin’s policies and instructions for University e-mail here (http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-
policy) .
SSD Accommodations
If you have already discussed your needs with Student Services, and received an Accommodation Letter, you still must discuss specific
accommodations with your professor. Please let me know, as soon as possible, if you will need specific accommodations, such as additional
time on tests, assistance with notes, or class materials. We are happy to work with you to ensure you have everything you need. However, if
you do not specifically discuss this with your professor, and have an official letter from SSD, you will not be allowed an exception.

Title IX
The University of Texas is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students that is free of all forms of discrimination and
sexual harassment, including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you (or someone you know) has
experienced or experiences any of these incidents, know that you are not alone. The University has staff members trained to support you in
navigating campus life, accessing health and counseling services, providing academic and housing accommodations, helping with legal
protective orders, and more.
Please be aware all UT faculty members are “responsible employees,” which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual
harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator.
Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal
complaint. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you need.
