I. WHAT IS THIS CLASS ABOUT?
Course Description
What were the crusades? Was a crusade an armed pilgrimage, holy war, or a war of conquest?
What motivated those who fought and those supported these expeditions? What were the
political, cultural, and religious developments that led to the crusades and what were their
legacies both in Europe and in the eastern Mediterranean? This research seminar explores
these questions by examining both accounts of crusades written by medieval authors and
modern historians' interpretations of these documents. In the process, we will investigate
religious encounters between eastern and western Christians, Christian heretics, Jews,
Muslims, and polytheists; political, military, and cultural changes of the high middle ages; and
the ways that crusading ideas and symbols have been reused in contemporary politics and
popular culture.
Course Goals:
Here’s what I expect you will learn this semester:
    •to understand the chronology and geographical extent of the expeditions we call the
crusades
    •to understand and evaluate the scholarly debates over the definitions, causes, and
consequences of the crusades


     •to analyze the primary documents associated with the crusades so as to understand
the perspectives and contexts of their authors and their audiences
     •to formulate your own research topics and develop your skills in historical research
     •to write and speak more clearly, to articulate your position or argument, and to
support it effectively and respectfully.
Writing and Independent Inquiry Flags
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write
regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback
from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to
revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work.
You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written
work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking,
Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher
Education Coordinating Board.
This course also carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are
designed to engage you in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing you
with the opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related
to your major. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from
the independent investigation and presentation of your own work.

III. What else is useful to know?


Attendance policy: I take attendance and expect you to attend class. Excuses will be granted
only for a documented medical problem, a religious holiday, or an absence due to official
university business; expect a request for written documentation although this may be waived
in the case of a flu outbreak.
Use of Canvas in Class. In this class I use Canvas—a Web-based course management
system with password-protected access at http://canvas.utexas.edu—to distribute
course materials, to communicate and collaborate online, to post grades, to submit
assignments, and to give you online quizzes and surveys. You can find support in using
Canvas at the ITS Help Desk at 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., so plan
accordingly. Two bits of advice:
a) You must use Chrome or Firefox as your browser.
b) You must use your @utexas.edu email. All messages/announcements from Canvas will
go to your @utexas.edu inbox.
Statement on academic integrity: Don’t cheat. I report all cases of scholastic dishonesty
to the Dean of Students. My recommended penalty for cheating on tests, plagiarism on
papers, or unauthorized use of i>clickers is an F for the course. We will discuss research
techniques, citation forms, and issues of academic dishonesty in class. If you remain
unsure about the exact definition of scholastic dishonesty or what constitutes plagiarism,
you should consult the information about academic integrity produced by the Dean of
Students Office: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Make-up Assignments: I will only give make up accommodations because of a
documented medical problem, a religious holiday, or official university business. In all
cases, I should receive valid written documentation for the absence. If the absence is due
to university business, I should receive this documentation at least one class prior to the
exam.
Students with Disabilities: Any student with a documented disability who requires
academic accommodations should contact the Services for Students with Disabilities
(471-6259) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized
accommodations.
Religious Holidays: Students can make up work missed because of a religious holiday as
long as they provide the instructor with documentation before the holiday occurs.
Academic Assistance:
    The Sanger Learning Center offers both group and individualized programs to help
increase efficiency in college-level writing, reading, and learning strategies. All SCL
programs, except appointment tutoring, are free to all currently enrolled students. The
SCL is located in the Jester Center, Room A332A. http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/slc
    The Undergraduate Writing Center offers free assistance to UT undergraduates
who wish to work on their writing; students work with trained consultants to define
their goals and become more confident writers. The Center is located in the FAC 211, and
is highly recommended. http://uwc.utexas.edu/


Other Resources:
    Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): If you are worried about someone who is
acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone
your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a
partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health
Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas
Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit

    Career Exploration Center: http://www.utexas.edu/student/careercenter/
    Student Emergency Services: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/
provides assistance, intervention, and referrals to support students navigating
challenging or unexpected issues that impact their well-being and academic success.
    UT Outpost: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/utoutpost.php for
students with food insecurity as well as those in need of professional clothes for
interviews and internships.
Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students. E-mail is recognized as an official
mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are responsible for reading your e-
mail for university and course-related information and announcements. You are
responsible to keep the university informed about changes to your e-mail address. You
should check your e-mail regularly and frequently to stay current with university-related
communications, some of which may be time-critical. You can find UT Austin’s policies
and instructions for updating your e-mail address at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564
Emergency Evacuation Policy. Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are
required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an
announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that
the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building. If you
require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class. In the
event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors. Do not re-
enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT
Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
