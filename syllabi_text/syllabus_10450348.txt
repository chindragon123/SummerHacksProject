Textbook
Calculus, Early Transcendentals, 8th edition, by James Stewart
Course Overview
This course is a continuation of M408C and covers a variety of topics in the theory of functions of
one or more variables: techniques of integration, improper integrals, differential equations, infinite
sequences and series, power and Taylor series, parametric curves, and derivatives and integrals
of vector and multivariable functions with applications. Its objective is to provide students with
practical mathematical skills necessary for advanced studies in all areas of science and engineering.
Emphasis will be placed on concepts and computations rather than proofs.
Prerequisites
Mathematics 408C, 408L, or 408S with a grade of at least C-; or consent of instructor.
Rules for the Classroom
I expect you to be courteous to each other. Academic Dishonesty will result in an F for the course.
Grading
Your grade will be determined by online homework, 4 in-class exams, and a final exam. Grades
will be determined using the following scale:
100-93, A      92-90, A-     89-87, B+       86-83, B    82-80, B-      79-77, C+
76-73, C     72-70, C-     69-65, D+       64-60, D    59-0, F
Homework (10%): Homework assignments will typically cover two lectures worth of material and
be due at 11:30p. Homework will be assigned regularly via the Web using the UT Homework Ser-


vice, QUEST; all answers and grades will be returned via the Web also using Quest. The lowest
3 scores will be dropped. I will add 5% of your instapoll average to your HW grade but your
homework average is capped at 100.
This course makes use of the web-based Quest content delivery and homework server system maintained by the
College of Natural Sciences. This homework service will require a $30 charge per student per class for its use,
with no student being charged more than $60 a semester. This goes toward the maintenance and operation of the
resource. Please go to http://quest.cns.utexas.edu to log in to the Quest system for this class. After the 12th
day of class, when you log into Quest you will be asked to pay via credit card on a secure payment site. Quest
provides mandatory instructional material for this course, just as is your textbook, etc. For payment questions,
email quest.billing@cns.utexas.edu.
In-Class Exams (60%): The exam dates are 06/19, 07/08, 07/29, and 08/12. Calculators are
not allowed during the exams. I replace your lowest exam grade with your final if that will help
your course grade. Because of this policy there will be absolutely positively no make-up
exams. The exams will be administered on Quest and are multiple choice.
Final Exam (30%): The final exam is cumulative. It is scheduled for Saturday, August 15th from
7 to 10p. If you do not show up to the final exam, you will earn a 0 on the final.
Student with Disabilities
Students who fall under the University’s Learning Disability Policy must present certification of
that fact to the student’s instructor prior to the first test. The University of Austin provides upon
request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more
information and certification letter, contact the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement,
Services for Students with Disabilities:
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/, 471- 6259, 471-6441 TTY.
Students with disabilities must make arrangements with the instructor or the UT Testing center
2 weeks before each exam. Failure to do so will result in a student forfeiting their accommodations.
