Welcome to Intro to Child Psych! I am excited to be teaching this course and look forward to
getting to know each one of you. This course will provide you with a broad understanding of
child psychology and help you become a critical consumer of psychological research and media
reports related to the field. In doing so, we will cover topics that may be controversial or
sensitive; thus, it is important to me that we create a respectful, supportive, and honest class
environment in which we can all be comfortable and learn from one another. Nell and I are here
to support you, so please stop by and say hello during our office hours!
Course Description:
Together, we will explore the cognitive, social, and emotional aspects of human development
from conception to adolescence. How do infants and young children manage to learn so much
about the world around them without formal education? How much does the environment we are
raised in influence the people we become? In exploring these and other questions, we will
examine a variety of factors that influence the course of development— from genetics, to
parenting, and the media— and learn about the research methods that psychologists use to study
child psychology. Specific topics covered will include: social relationships, morality, language
and literacy, perceptual and motor systems, and cognitive foundations of physics and math. The
implications of course content for child-rearing, education, and social policy will also be
considered. Active student participation will be an important aspect of your learning experience,
so I ask that you attend all class meetings.
Course Objectives:
        1. To introduce you to the field of child psychology.
        2. To provide you with the skills and information necessary to be a critical consumer of
            research and media reports regarding children and their development.
        3. To help you apply research in child psychology to real world concerns and your own
            experiences.
Prerequisites:
You must have completed PSY 301 with a grade of C or better to be in this course. Please note
that you cannot receive credit for both PSY 304 and PSY 333D.
Required Text:
Siegler, R. S., Saffran, J., Eisenberg, N., DeLoache, J. S., Gershoff, E., & Leaper, C. (2014).
How Children Develop (4th ed.) New York, NY: Worth Publishers.


Other readings will be posted on Canvas.
Course Website:
The course syllabus, additional readings, assignments, and updates will be posted on Canvas
(https://canvas.utexas.edu). Please be sure to check Canvas often, as it is your responsibility to
keep up with all posted announcements and messages.
Attendance and Participation:
Although attendance will not be directly factored into your grade, I expect everyone to attend
class and actively participate in discussion. It is in your best interest to attend class, as lecture
material will not always be covered in the textbook and will be essential to successful
performance on exams. We will watch interesting videos and have thought-provoking
discussions that I hope will be both fun and helpful. Powerpoint slides of lecture material will be
posted on Canvas, but will not be comprehensive.
If you must miss a class, it will be your responsibility to find out what you missed (i.e.,
announcements, handouts, lecture notes). Thus, I strongly encourage you to make a friend (or
two!) in the class so that you can reach out in case of absence. Nell will also be keeping a set of
lecture notes in case of necessary absences. If you still have questions about the material after
obtaining notes, Nell and I are always more than happy to help.
                                              Assessments
“About You” Survey:
You should complete the online “About You” survey on Canvas by midnight on Wednesday,
July 17th. This assignment is a chance for me to begin getting to know you, your goals, and your
experiences as they relate to this class. It is also a chance for you to communicate anything you’d
like me to know and to ask any questions you have for me. I look forward to reading your
responses!
The “About You” survey will count towards your participation score.
Exams:
You will have the opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of course material on three
non-comprehensive exams given over the course of the semester. Exams will test your
understanding of material from lecture, class discussion, the textbook, and in-class videos. Exam
dates are as follows:
Exam 1: Thursday, July 25th
Exam 2: Wednesday, August 7th
Exam 3: Friday, August 16th
An optional cumulative final exam will be given on Saturday, August 17th from 7:00pm –
8:30pm. This optional final serves as an opportunity for you to replace a low grade from one of
the earlier, non-comprehensive exams and demonstrate a higher grasp of the material. Taking the


optional final exam cannot lower your grade. Each exam (including the three non-comprehensive
exams and the optional final) is worth 70 points; only your top three exam scores will contribute
to your final grade. If you take the optional final exam and earn a grade lower than any of your
other exam scores, it will not be considered in the calculation of your overall grade in the course.
Optional Final Exam: Saturday, August 17th from 7:00pm – 8:30pm.
Exams will make up 70% of your final grade (210 points total; 70 points each for your best 3
scores out of 4 possible exams, including the optional final).
Study Guides:
To encourage and reward you for good study habits, I will ask you to turn in a study guide for
each of the three non-cumulative exams (i.e., excluding the optional final). Because
psychological research demonstrates that simply rereading notes is not the most effective study
strategy, your study guides should not simply be a copy of your class notes, but instead should
elaborate on the material in some way. For example, you can make flashcards, draw diagrams,
come up with examples of concepts, write how you would explain concepts and studies to others
in your own words, create and take practice tests, or some combination of these things. Study
guides will be graded based on completeness (i.e., covers all major material for the unit) and
demonstration of effective strategies. Please see the file “How to Study Effectively” for more
ideas and study strategies supported by research in cognitive psychology.
Study guides will make up 10% of your final grade (30 points total; 10 points each for Exams 1,
2, and 3).
Quizzes:
Psychological research suggests that frequent quizzing improves learning (e.g., Roediger,
Putnam, & Smith, 2011; posted on Canvas). As such, a total of seven unannounced “pop”
quizzes will be given throughout the semester. Each quiz will cover material from previous
lectures and readings. Another goal of these quizzes is to incentivize you to attend class and to
keep up with reading. In addition, the quizzes will allow you to assess your understanding of
class material, identify concepts that you need to study more, and give you an idea of the types of
questions that will appear on exams. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.
Quizzes will make up 10% of your final grade (30 points total; 5 points each for your best 6
scores out of 7 quizzes).
Written Reflections:
You will write a total of three reflections over the course of the semester. The purpose of these
entries is to encourage critical thought and reflection on course themes outside of class. These
reflections should focus on any theoretical, philosophical, or practical questions the course
material raised for you OR connections between the course material and your experiences
outside the classroom (e.g., an interaction with your niece, the announcement of a public policy
relating to children, an advertisement for a children’s toy you saw). Each entry should be
approximately 1-2 pages double-spaced. Reflections will be graded based on the depth and
thoughtfulness of your reflection (i.e., not merely summarizing) in addition to proper writing.


Written reflections do not have a specific due date; instead, I want you to write entries when you
feel you have something interesting to reflect on. However, you must turn in at least one of these
reflections by Monday, July 29th. You can submit the reflections on Canvas anytime throughout
the semester but your remaining two reflections must be in by midnight on the last day of class,
Friday, August 16th.
First reflection due no later than: Monday, July 29th
Remaining two reflections due no later than: Friday, August 16th.
Written reflections will make up 10% of your final grade (30 points total; 10 points each).
                                          Grading Policies
You will have a chance to earn up to 300 total points for this course. Please see the breakdown of
assessments and possible points below:
                       Assessment Type                             Points Possible
       Exams: 70 points each x 3 (the optional final
       exam can replace a lower grade on one earlier                     210
       exam)
       Study Guides: 10 points each x 3 (one for each                     30
       exam, excluding optional final)
       Written Reflections: 10 points each x 3                            30
       Quizzes: 5 points each x 6 (your lowest score will                 30
       be dropped; best 6 out of 7 scores)
                              Total                                      300
Your letter grade will be based on the total number of points you earn throughout the semester.
Your points will be posted on Canvas under the “Grades” tab. Final grades that fall between
the border between two grades will be determined based on attendance and participation.
Please take advantage of opportunities to earn points throughout the semester and visit me in
office hours if you need help understanding the material or developing effective study skills.

No grade changes will be made except in the case of error. If you believe an error was made in
the grading of your exam, quiz, or writing assignment and would like to challenge the grade, you
must email me a written challenge (with clear and specific justification) within four days after
grades are posted (not at the end of the semester). Incomplete grades will be given only in rare
circumstances. There will be no extra credit opportunities in the course, so I strongly encourage
you to plan ahead in starting assignments and to keep up with the coursework throughout the
term.
                                    Additional Course Policies
Make-Up Exams:
Make-up exams will be given under compelling circumstances. Make-up exams will be all-essay
format and should be taken within one week of the missed exam. Alternatively, you may choose
to take the optional final exam in order to make up the points for the missed exam. There will be
no make-up exam for the optional final exam.
Late Work:
If you are struggling with the material or dealing with an issue outside of class that impedes your
ability to complete an assignment on time, please discuss this with me before the due date. I will
allow late work under compelling circumstances.
Laptops:
Research shows that taking notes on laptops is ineffective and can hinder learning in the
classroom, even regardless of student motivation and intelligence (e.g., Ravizza, Uitvlugt, &
Fenn, 2016; posted on Canvas). Your laptop can also distract other students from the lecture.
Powerpoint slides from lecture will be posted on Canvas, so you do not need to write down every
word presented in class. Instead, I ask that you take notes by hand and leave computers in your
bag during class time. If this policy is a problem for you, please talk to me.
Students with Disabilities:
I am committed to providing a level playing field for all students in this course. As such, I am
happy to make accommodations for students with documented disabilities. Please contact me as
soon as possible about the accommodations that you require, or if the material presented in class
is not accessible. Any student with a documented disability who requires academic
accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at 512-471-6259
(voice call) of 1-866-329-3986 (video call). More information is available online at the following
address: http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/
Academic Integrity, Cheating, and Plagiarism:
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.


Cheating on exams undermines the opportunity to learn. A single instance of cheating or
plagiarism on a single question or assignment might result in course failure. Please read about
academic integrity on this website: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Every student has the potential to do well in this course without resorting to cheating or
plagiarism. If you are confused about the material or need help developing effective study
strategies, please visit my office hours. If you are unsure what constitutes plagiarism, you can
also see me to discuss the topic. It is my job—and my pleasure—to help you succeed honestly!
Religious Holidays:
I am happy to give any student who misses an exam, quiz, or other assignment due to the
observance of a religious holiday a chance to complete the missed work. By UT Austin policy,
you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holiday. If you must miss a class, an exam, or a quiz in order to observe
a religious holiday, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time after the absence.
Emergency Exits:
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
assembling outside.
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department,
The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.


                               Schedule of Topics and Assignments
        Below is a list of classic topics, readings, and other assignments for the semester. As the
semester progresses, I may make changes to the schedule below. The syllabus posted on Canvas
will always be the most up-to date, current version. I will always announce any changes in class
and via a Canvas message. Readings can be completed before or after the lecture for that
day, depending on what works best for you, but should be completed prior to the next
lecture. Information from the readings will show up on exams and quizzes.
