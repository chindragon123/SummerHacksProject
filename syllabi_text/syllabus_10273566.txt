   Shifting Voices: Media and Technology in 1990s America
                              AMS 370 / Spring 2020 / Unique # 31175
                                  Tues/Thurs 12:30-2:00, BUR 436A
Instructor: Dr. Brendan Gaughen
Office hours:
This course takes a critical look at the social and cultural impacts of the changing landscapes of
media and advances in technology that occurred between the late 1980s and early 2000s, a time
span that brought fundamental shifts in the ways information is produced and consumed.
Particularly in the United States, this decade saw the rise of cable news, the mainstreaming of
“marginal” culture, the fragmentation of mass audiences into increasingly narrow categories, and
an unprecedented concentration of corporate media that occurred alongside the proliferation of
new media outlets. Perhaps most profoundly, the exponential growth in the use of computers and
the internet disrupted traditional forms of community as it created new ones, providing a greater
voice for some groups while often silencing others. Paying attention to the historic, economic, and
geopolitical context of the time period, this course turns the lens on media and technology
themselves, examining how particular developments and shifts during this decade continue to
impact American culture and society today.
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience
with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the
semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from me to help you
improve your writing. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come
from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical
Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher
Education Coordinating Board. This course also carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent
Inquiry courses are designed to engage you in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester,
providing you with the opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or
project related to your major. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to
come from the independent investigation and presentation of your own work.
                                             COURSE GOALS
This class has three principal content-based objectives.
1) Greater understanding of the changes in the production and consumption of information in the
recent past
2) Greater understanding of how varying perspectives shape the remembering and retelling of history
3) Greater understanding of the plurality of viewpoints and experiences of Americans since the 1980s
In addition to learning about recent historical events, this course has several skills-based objectives that
you will develop over the course of the semester. These skills will not only be useful over the course of
your academic career, but are essential in the workplace and to the development of an active,
informed, and engaged citizenry.
1) Writing skills. We will learn how to cogently craft an argument based on specific evidence and how to
respond to counter arguments. We will also learn how to craft clear thesis statements and organize an
argument effectively.


2) Respectful discussion. Because this course deals with some heated political topics, we will learn how
to rationally and respectfully disagree with colleagues with whom we might have differences of
opinion.
3) Close reading and analysis. We will learn how to interrogate and analyze texts that carry specific and
often oblique messages to their audiences.
                                              COURSE POLICIES
Readings. All required texts will be in the course reader, available for purchase at Jenn’s Copies (2518
Guadalupe St). I encourage each of you to be active readers and interact with the texts by underlining,
highlighting, and engaging with the texts as you see fit. Please bring the reader to class each day ready
to discuss the assigned texts, ideally with a specific question or talking point in mind. It should go
without saying that in a discussion-based course, showing up to class having done the reading is
essential.
Attendance. This class is discussion-oriented so attendance is imperative. Missing an excess of four
class days will result in a reduced final grade. Explained absences for religious holidays, sanctioned
travel related to sports of military service, or other absences you can plan in advance will not
necessarily count against you if at least one week’s notice is given. Unforeseen absences, such as illness
or family emergency, will be excused once proper documentation is provided, at my discretion. The
attendance policy will take effect starting Tuesday, February 4.
Office hours. I strongly encourage each of you to come to office hours at least once (preferably more)
during the semester so you can get the most out of the course. This is an opportunity for you to go over
assignment expectations, difficult aspects of the readings, and seek feedback on your written work
before you turn it in. Or just come by to say hello.
Devices. Laptops and tablets in class must be on silent and should not be used for any reason other
than course-related material. I trust you all will use technology responsibly, but failure to abide by this
policy may result in the revocation of in-class laptop/tablet privileges.
Communication. Course-related announcements, relevant or interesting links, and other important
information will be sent to you via email, so please check your email regularly. I will respond to email
within 24 hours of receipt unless unforeseen circumstances arise.
Discussion. This course is built upon discussing topics that may be controversial and difficult. I
encourage all of you to share your informed opinions, feelings, and experiences, and to engage in
conversations that invite productive and respectful disagreement.
Course website. A copy of this syllabus, instructions for individual assignments, and announcements
will be posted to the course Canvas site.
Late work. Late work will receive a deduction of one letter grade per class day past the due date.
Extensions will not be granted unless under extraordinary circumstances.
Written assignments. All assignments must be types with 1-inch margins, 12 point font (Times New
Roman). Use a standard citation style (e.g. Chicago Style, MLA) to cite your sources when applicable. All
papers must be turned in as hard copies at the beginning of class on their due dates.
Undergraduate Writing Center. Given this course’s writing requirements, I strongly encourage you to
take advantage of the resources available to you at the Undergraduate Writing Center on campus (PCL
2.330, http://uwc.utexas.edu).
Students with disabilities. Any student with a documented disability who requires academic
accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at 512-471-6259 (voice) or
1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty members are not required to provide accommodations without
an official accommodation letter from SSD.
Academic honesty. In an effort to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and integrity in the
classroom, cheating and plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. Cheating or plagiarism will result in
an automatic zero for the assignment and will be reported to the Dean of Students. University policies
regarding academic dishonesty available at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php.


Grading system. This course follows a plus/minus grading system:
A 93-100 / A- 90-92 / B+ 87-89 / B 83-86 / B- 80-82 / C+ 77-79
C 73-76 / C- 70-72 / D+ 67-69 / D 63-66 / D- 60-62 / F 0-59
TL;DR version: show up to class prepared to discuss the readings, be respectful of each other, put
phones away, submit assignments on time, show up to class consistently, don’t plagiarize.
