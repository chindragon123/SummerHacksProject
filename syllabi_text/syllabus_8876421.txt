Description
This is the second course in the School of Architecture’s two-part introduction to the
history of architecture. It offers a global perspective of buildings, their settings, and the
dissemination of ideas about architecture from the eighteenth century to the present.
Particular attention is given the relationships of architectural expression, meaning, and
building technology and to issues arising when architectural traditions of one culture are
imposed upon or otherwise adapted by another.
Educational Objectives
•   Establish chronological and thematic frameworks for the study of architectural history
•   Understand social, political, and physical influences affecting changes in the design
    of the built environment
•   Understand how notions of modernity and modernism apply to architecture
•   Develop skills of description and formal analysis
•   Be able to critically read and respond to primary and secondary texts on nineteenth-
    and twentieth-century architecture
•   Be able to conduct research using primary and secondary sources
Texts
Barry Bergdoll, European Architecture, 1750-1890 (Oxford University Press, 2000)
William J. R. Curtis, Modern Architecture since 1900 (Prentice-Hall, 1983)

Reader response statements and discussion leader exercise
For each of the designated discussion sessions, please write a brief response to the
readings (2-3 pages should suffice). You may express support or disagreement with the
author’s position, comment on the subject matter, or otherwise relate it to something
you’ve encountered elsewhere. The object of the exercise is to offer a direction for
discussion. Full credit will be awarded for papers submitted on time, meet the intent of
the assignment, and show care in the way they are written.
For each discussion session with an assigned reading, I’ll ask two or three students to
work together to enrich the discussion by providing images or other material. Discussion
leaders do not need to turn in a response statement.
Research projects
The two research projects exercise your skill addressing two types of research: on local
architecture and on architecture outside Western Europe and the United States. Each has
two parts: a class discussion and a research paper. You may work individually or with a
partner.
Project #1: Choose a building (or large-scale structure, such as a bridge) in Austin or
immediate environs built between the mid-19th century and ca. 1950 (a list of suggestions
will be posted on Canvas). Research its history and architectural features (formal or
technical). For the discussion section, please bring one or more images of your subject.
They should be large enough to be legible for small group sitting around a table. For the
paper, set out your account of the building and then place select aspects of its history
(including your analysis of its design) in a broader context. For example, you might
consider its place in the history of its building type or its relationship to its setting. You
might consider what the building indicates of the professional interests of its architect or
client.
If you write the paper on your own, it should be about 5-7 pages long, plus notes and
bibliography. If you write it with a partner, it should be 8-10 pages long (the paper will
receive one grade for both students).
Project #2: Select a topic concerning a twentieth-century building located outside
Western Europe or the United States. You also may focus on a designer (architect or
engineer) or a theme. Present your topic as before at the discussion section and develop it
as a paper 5-7 pages long (8-10 pages if you work with a partner).
Midterm and final examinations
These will be take-home essay examinations focused on the material covered in lecture
and our weekly discussions.

Ground Rules
Please note that Jessen is one of the finest auditoriums on campus. Help keep it that way
by not bringing food or drink into the hall.
The Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity and responsibility. Each member of the University is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
toward peers and community.
Please take heed of your professional responsibilities regarding plagiarism. If you are
unsure about what constitutes plagiarism or have difficulty handling source material in
your papers, please don’t hesitate to speak with me.
Deadlines and attendance policy
All assignments and examinations must be submitted on the due dates. Late papers may
be penalized. Incompletes (X grades) will be awarded only in instances of medical or
severe family emergencies. Documentation may be required. Regular attendance is
expected. Students with more than two unexcused absences from the discussion section
will incur a letter-grade deduction in the final grade.
Accommodation for religious holidays
University policy requires notification of the instructor at least fourteen days prior to the
date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, or
other assignment in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given the
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Services for Students
Any student with a documented disability (physical or cognitive) who requires academic
accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities as soon as
possible to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations.

The Counseling & Mental Health Center (CMHC) offers resources for general health and
well-being, time management, stress management, test anxiety and other personal
concerns. The Center is located on the 5th floor of the Student Services Building. The
telephone number is (512) 471-3515. cmhc.utexas.edu

Research Tools
When setting out to learn more about a particular topic, many students forget about two
types of valuable sources: (1) specialized encyclopedias and dictionaries and (2) journal
articles. Encyclopedias and dictionaries will provide answers for many basic questions
and help you to define topics. Three excellent sources are the Macmillan Encyclopedia of
Architects (a biographical dictionary) available in the reference area of the Architecture
and Planning Library, the Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Architecture available in the
library and on-line, and the encyclopedic Dictionary of Art (also available on-line), which
covers individual designers, historic and stylistic periods, theoretical concepts, and
terminology.
Don’t limit your bibliographic searches to the books in UTCAT. Journal articles can be
identified using search engines supported by the university libraries. See the link:
Databases and Indexes to Articles: www.lib.utexas.edu/indexes/
For architecture, an essential search tool is the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals.
Many full-text articles on architecture may be found by searching the JSTOR database.
If you have questions about using any of these tools, please don’t hesitate to ask me. In
addition, the staff of the Architecture and Planning Library in Battle Hall is very
generous with their assistance. They have posted information about the library and doing
research on architectural topics on the library web page: www.lib.utexas.edu/apl/
Resources for Texas: Despite the state’s size, population, and wealth, Texas architecture
has not been as thoroughly studied as one might expect, and it can take some ingenuity to
sort out the history of even familiar buildings, much less the background buildings of the
urban and rural landscapes. A good beginning point for developing a research strategy is
the following guide to the study of Texas architecture on the Architecture and Planning
Library website:
