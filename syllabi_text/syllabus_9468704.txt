COURSE OBJECTIVES
      This course builds on Adv/PR 309 (or Stats 306, etc.) to further explore
      the research methods commonly used in Advertising and PR.
      This course is foundational for your future courses (especially media,
      management and campaigns), your career, and for your lifetime role as a
      consumer of research.
      This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag.
COURSE FORMAT
      Lectures provide the course content and supplement the readings,
      quizzes ensure concepts from readings are learned weekly, in-class polls
      and discussion posts provide opportunities for in-class engagement,
      assignments apply course concepts in practical ways, and exams offer
      assessments of learning progress at key checkpoints.

  STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
  The University provides academic accommodations for qualified students
  with disabilities. Contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-
  6259 (voice) or 232-2937 (video phone). If accommodations include
  testing time and control of distractions, please arrange to take your
  exams in the SSD facility. Remind me to send the exam there before the
  scheduled exam date, and have them email the exam back to me for
  grading.


                                                                           Kahlor 4
IN-CLASS POLLS – 5%
    We use Qualtrics Surveys for polling in class. These are NOT announced
    ahead of time and record geo-location, meaning you have to be in-class to
    get credit for participating. The purpose is to build an in-class community
    and share ideas. I will drop the two lowest scores – this includes sick
    days, emergencies or technical failures.
DISCUSSION POSTS – 5%
    Periodically we will post on Canvas discussion prompts to which you must
    respond within a given time-frame. I will drop one – this includes sick
    days, emergencies or technical failures.
QUIZZES – 8%
    Quizzes are administered online via Canvas. The quizzes focus only on the
    book and each consists of 8 questions answered in 10 minutes. Note that
    quizzes are due by class time on the days noted on the class schedule
    below. Add the due dates to your personal calendar.
    You have one week from the day a grade is posted to resolve dispute about
    the grade. I will drop your lowest quiz grade – this includes missed
    quizzes, sick days, emergencies or technical failures.
    Complete the readings for the week, take notes and then take the quiz. You
    usually have more than 72 hours to access a quiz, but once you start it, you
    must finish it in 10 minutes. NOTE: Sometimes Canvas crashes or freezes
    and I often am not available the few hours right before class.


                                                                          Kahlor 5
EXAMS – 40%
   There will be three in-class multiple-choice exams and an optional final
   during finals week. See Calendar for the scheduled dates.
   Exams will cover materials presented in class and readings. You are
   responsible for readings, even if content is not reiterated in class.
   A study guide and review session will be provided prior to each in-class
   exam.
   After the exams are graded and the grades are posted, you have ONE
   WEEK to look over the exam questions during Prof. Kahlor's office hours.
   Any grade concerns MUST be resolved then.
   An optional comprehensive final examination will be offered Monday,
   May 20, 2:00 pm-5:00 pm as a make-up option for anyone who has missed
   one of the in-class exams or for
   anyone who wants to try to            There is no way to know now if you

   any test was missed for any reason – this includes sick days, travel or
   emergencies.

ASSIGNMENTS- 40%
     Your TA will work with you on assignments, as well as grade them. She/he
     will be available during face-to-face office hours in the Belo building and by
     appointment and email. Questions about assignment grades must be
     raised in the week following the posting of your grade. Always start
     with your TA.

     initial grade is posted.
RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONALISM - 2%
Research Participation
     You must earn 2 research credits via studies that will become available
     throughout the semester. I do not honor research points from other
     departments or schools. Do not take a study more than once (e.g., to meet
     another class’ requirements) or the credit will be voided. You will not
     receive extra credit in this class for participating in more than 2 studies,
     although you may have additional research requirements in other classes.
Professionalism
     Please be respectful with the teaching team and your peers. Remain
     attentive and engaged in lecture. Arrive on time, do not pack up early, and
     stay for the entire class period. Please refrain from distracting behaviors
     like watching movies in class or surfing the web.


                                                                            Kahlor 7
RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS
    Notify us of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of

    assignment, or project.
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HONOR CODE
    Core values of UT Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
    individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member is expected to
    uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
    toward peers and community.
POLICY ON SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY
    Academic dishonesty is cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
    falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating
    honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not
    limited to, providing false or misleading information to receive a
    postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and
    submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses
    without the prior permission of the instructor. These are the course
    guidelines and you must adhere to them. Students who violate University
    rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
    including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
    University. Please read
