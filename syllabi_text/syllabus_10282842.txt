COURSE DESCRIPTION
The past six years have witnessed numerous movements, events, surges, encounters, and discussions
of white nationalism across the globe. Violent shootings and murders in Charleston, Christchurch,
and El Paso, as well as political movements in Greece, Hungary, and Poland have been attributed to
the rising tides of white nationalism. In this class we will ask critical questions about the
constructions of whiteness and nationalism across the globe as we analyze, examine, and study white
nationalism. What is the terminology that gets used to talk about this subject? What is whiteness and
how have the boundaries of whiteness changed throughout history and how can we examine these
changes alongside shifting national boundaries? What is the relationship between far-right political
groups and white nationalism? In this class we will use an anthropological lens to explore the
intersections of race, whiteness, and nationalism to trace the history of white nationalism and its
present-day global resurgence. Part one of the course will provide a foundation for understanding
key terminology and concepts and in the second half of the course will examine more specific
subjects including eugenics, extremist violence, and the internet and new communication
technologies.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
At the end of this course students should be able to:
    • Articulate how common categories such as race and nation are socially and historically
         created and reproduced
    • Explain, broadly, the historical roots of white nationalism and identify how it emerges and
         re-emerges in the present-day
    • Communicate in anthropological terms about white nationalism from a global perspective
    • Differentiate and explain the significance of important concepts in current usage to discuss
         white nationalism
    • Demonstrate that they have developed a capacity to produce a substantive analytical paper
         on a topic closely related to the course
READINGS
Readings for the course will be uploaded to Canvas. You will be responsible for weekly reading
responses that you will also upload to Canvas. This class draws from numerous current events and at
times there may be a need to add additional readings that are not on the syllabus. I will inform you if
this happens. I will use canvas to communicate and collaborate online, to post grades, and to submit
assignments. You can find support in using Canvas at the ITS Help desk (512-475-9400) which is
open Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
                                                     1


COURSE FORMAT
This is an upper-division seminar course and I expect your full and active participation. There will
be some lecturing but the majority of the course will focus on discussion, in-class activities, and
small group work. You will deeply engage readings and in class we will cover a range of different
materials in different ways. As such, it is imperative that you do the readings and complete them
ahead of time. If you do not do the readings you will not do well in the course.
The content and discussion of this course will engage with race and racism every single week. The
course will at times be emotionally and intellectually challenging to engage with and I will do my best
to make this classroom a space where we can thoughtfully and intentionally engage one another.
Because this course takes a close look at dehumanization, we will do a couple of activities
throughout the semester to emphasize and reemphasize our common humanity.
GLOBAL CULTURES FLAG
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your
familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at
least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS
1. Attendance (10%)
Each student is allowed two absences for any reason. After two absences your grade will be
negatively affected. If you miss a class it is your responsibility to still do the readings and get class
notes from one of your peers. Even if you miss class you are responsible for submitting reading
responses.
2. Participation (15%)
You are required to actively participate in classroom discussion. Please come to class with readings
completed ahead of time. We will do numerous in-class reflections and thought exercises so it is
important to come to class prepared and on-time. Do not use your cell phone, send emails, visit
websites, etc. during class.
As part of your participation grade you are required to submit weekly reading responses. These can
be reflections, reactions, or critical commentary in response to the readings. They can also tie
readings together from previous weeks. These responses can be as short as three or four sentences
as long as you identify at least one takeaway and one or two questions that you have for in-class
discussion. Reading responses are due the Tuesday evenings before Wednesday class by 11:59 and
should be submitted on Canvas under assignments. Note, reading responses cannot be made up at
the end of the course. You will receive one grace week in the semester.
3. Short Papers (40%)
There will be three short papers (2-3 pages double-spaced) that you will complete over the course of
the semester. The paper prompt will be distributed two weeks before the due date. These short
papers will focus on material covered in the readings and in class; outside sources are not required.
All papers shall be submitted electronically via the Assignments tab on the Canvas course website.
Files should be submitted in .doc, .docx, or .pdf form.
The short papers are due on: March 02, April 01, April 27.
                                                      2


3. Final Paper Proposal (10%)
Before completing your final paper, you will first complete a proposal which includes the proposed
topic, a two-paragraph paper summary, and a list of at least three academic sources. I will provide
feedback on your proposal. You must receive approval from me before submitting your final paper.
The final paper proposal is due in class on March 25th.
4. Final Paper (25%)
For undergraduate students: You are responsible for submitting a final paper (6-8 pages double-
spaced). This assignment can expand upon a topic that we address in class or can be a new topic but
it must relate to the course material and course core focus. Papers need to be thorough, structured,
and well-researched. All papers shall be submitted to me in my office in hard-copy form by
Wednesday May 13th at 5:00 p.m.
For graduate students: You are responsible for submitting an academic paper (15 pages double-
spaced) on the topic of your choosing. Your paper must be tied to our course subject but can focus
on your area of research. You can expand ideas from the course or incorporate new ones. All papers
shall be submitted to me in my office in hard-copy form by Wednesday May 13th at 5:00 p.m.
All written assignments should be typed in Times New Roman 12pt font, double-spaced
and with one- inch margins. Your work will be graded on the clarity and technical proficiency of
your writing in addition to content.
GRADING POLICIES: Final letter grades will be assigned using the following scale:
  A: 93-100           C: 73-76
  A-: 90-92           C-: 70-72
  B+: 87-89           D+: 67-69
  B: 83-86            D: 64-66
  B-: 80-82           D-: 60-63
  C+: 77-79           F: 0-59
Re-grading Policy: If you believe that an assignment has been graded incorrectly, submit a written
request for a re-grade to Dr. West Ohueri within one week of when the graded assignment was
returned. The written request should include an explanation of your position and be attached to the
graded assignment. If you suspect that a simple addition error was made, speak to me to have the
error corrected. PLEASE NOTE: I ONLY DISCUSS GRADES IN PERSON, DURING OFFICE HOURS.
COURSE POLICIES
How do I contact the professor?
If you ever have any questions about the course material or my expectations, please do not hesitate
to contact me. The best way to catch me is to visit me during office hours. If you would like to meet
with me but are unable to attend during scheduled office hours, please email me to set up an
appointment. Email is the best way to reach me though during certain times (i.e. weekends, holidays)
                                                   3


I may not respond as quickly. When emailing me please remember proper email etiquette for
addressing faculty members. I prefer that you email me directly rather than through Canvas.
What if I turn in an assignment late?
If an assignment is turned in late, the assignment grade will be lowered by 10% for each day that the
assignment is late. If a serious issue (i.e. illness, family death, etc.) arises that may prevent you from
attending class or turning in an assignment on time, contact me by e-mail or phone as soon as
possible to discuss the possibility of an extension.
What happens if I need to miss class because of a religious holy day?
By UT Austin policy, you should notify the instructors of your pending absence at least fourteen
days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class or assignment in
order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work
within a reasonable time after the absence.
Can I record class sessions?
No audio or video recording of any presentation or class activity is permitted without our prior
written approval. The materials used in this class — including, but not limited to, handouts, slides,
and assignments — are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of class materials is a
violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against you. Sharing class
materials without my specific, written approval may also be a violation of the University's Student
Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.
This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing
those materials with other current or future students.
What if I need help writing?
As you begin to write your research paper, please consider visiting the Writing Center, which
provides professional consulting services for students who want to improve their writing:
http://uwc.utexas.edu.
What if I need accommodations?
Students with disabilities or a chronic illness may request appropriate academic accommodations
from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities
at https://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/, 512-471-6259 (voice), or 512-410-6644 (video phone).
Please notify me as soon as possible of any accommodations that will be needed.
Please let me know if you have any problem that is preventing you from performing satisfactorily in
this class.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND MISCONDUCT
All work for this course must be your own, and you must properly cite others in all of your writing
assignments. Academic dishonesty or misconduct of any sort will not be tolerated. This includes a
strict prohibition of using work you have written for other classes for our class writing assignments.

EMERGENCY EVACUATION POLICY:
Occupants of UT buildings are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is
activated or an announcement is made. Emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can
be found at: www.utexas.edu/emergency. Please be aware of these evacuation policies: (1)
Familiarize yourself with exits to the classroom and building. The nearest exit may not be the one
you used when you entered the building. (2) If you require assistance to evacuate, inform the
instructor in writing during the first week of class. (3) In the event of an evacuation, follow the
instructor’s directions. (4) Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin
