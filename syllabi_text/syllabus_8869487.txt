Course Description: Objectives: This class explores the diverse Native cultures of the
Southwest. The class focuses on the philosophical underpinnings and the frameworks of
meaning and moral responsibility of indigenous peoples of the American Southwest. The
goal is to give students a broader view of the Native peoples of North America and
specifically of the Southwest. By focusing on the diverse groups of the Southwest, this
course aims to increase knowledge concerning specific Native populations. The course
will involve three ethnographies and readings that will orient students to peoples and
issues of import in the Southwest. This course pays particular attention to the expressive
forms of Native American peoples and cultures of the Southwest as well as political
economy.

Course Requirements.
1.      Three book reviews 3-5 pages (double spaced) (each worth 20% of your grade)
2.      Film review 4-5 pages (double spaced) (15%)
4.      Reading Presentations (15%)
5.      Participation (10%)

                                                1


Each student will be asked to lead discussion on approximately 2 readings over the
course of the semester (the actual number of presentations will depend on the number of
students in the class). A BRIEF handout (summarizing the main points and having a set
of discussion questions) is required when presenting.
You will be required to write a brief (3-5 pages) review on each of the three
ethnographies assigned. This review should consist of both a brief summary of the work
and an evaluation of the work as well.
Each student will be required to write a brief review (4-5 pages) of the film Drunktown’s
Finest (shown during week 12). This review should evaluate the film, but also place the
film within the context of the class. How does the film speak to issues discussed in the
class? How does it challenge certain assumptions about Native peoples of the Southwest?
All syllabuses, like life, are works in progress. As the semester progresses, changes to the
syllabus may need to be made. Changes, as well, perhaps, to our lives may need to be
made.
