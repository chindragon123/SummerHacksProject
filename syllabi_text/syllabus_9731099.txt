PREREQUISITES
Students in this class have successfully completed all prerequisite courses and have a
solid foundation in the fundamentals of marketing as well as the various advertising and
public relations functional areas. Given the wide range of academic experiences in
prerequisite courses, students are required to quickly identify and resolve any gross
conflicts, fundamental inconsistencies, or background voids that exist. Because the
course requires a common advertising and public relations foundation, students are
responsible for timely background leveling.
REQUIRED MATERIAL
    • Integrated Brand Promotion Management: Text, Cases, and Exercises
        By: Murphy, John; Cunningham, Isabella; and Stavchansky Lewis, Liza
        ISBN: 978-0757577918
        Publisher: Kendall Hunt Publishing, 2011
COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course will help you develop and refine critical thinking skills that you will use in
the working world. Adding to what you have already learned in your previous courses,
you will learn a disciplined approach to addressing the varied challenges you will be
facing as communications professionals.
Using the case method, you will exercise your analytical skills to tackle a wide range of
interconnected advertising and public relations situations similar to what you will
encounter on the client and/or agency side of our industries.


COURSE OBJECTIVES
    • To present you with a structured, field-tested approach to decision-making that is
        a practical and useful method for addressing a variety of communications
        management issues.
    • Increase your level of competence and professionalism by helping you sharpen
        the following skills: strategic and critical thinking; planning; organizational,
        written, verbal and visual communication; time management; interpersonal and
        task group (bringing out the best in others).
STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES
This course requires you to:
    • assess problems, isolate key facts, and rank-order salient management issues;
    • think in a precise and structured manner, then follow a structured decision-
        making process;
    • make decisions and create action plans appropriate to the situation under
        consideration;
    • efficiently and persuasively write up your analysis and sell your
        recommendations; then
    • defend your case against criticism from your peers and others.
CLASS ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION
Attendance and participation is key to doing well in this class. Attendance will be taken
and participation will be noted in each class. And by definition, you must be present to
earn attendance and participation points. These points cannot be made up at another
time.
Specifically, the ONLY excused absence is a university recognized absence,
which much be accompanied with a doctor’s note or signed letter from one of your
parents if a family bereavement.
Family reunions or travel are not excusable absences from this class. If you will miss a
class for reasons of religious or military observance or extracurricular activity
sanctioned by the university you must let us know WELL IN ADVANCE (see UT policy
below), not the day before.
Along with a doctor’s note, if you are sick, you must email me prior to one hour before
class starts. Then, to be excused, you must email me with the doctor’s note within 24
hours.
For instance, if you’re sick on Monday then you need to email me by 10 a.m. letting me
know you won’t be in class because you’re ill. Then you need to email me with your
doctor’s note by 11 a.m. on Tuesday. If I don’t have the note, it’s not an excused absence.


And if you miss a class, for whatever reason, you are responsible for finding out what
happened in that class. Don’t email me or Harlie asking us to summarize the
discussion you missed. Check with a classmate for notes.
When you show up, be prepared for discussion. As you read the text, outside readings
and cases, do the following: Create a written outline of the material, list unanswered
questions, boil the reading down into 4 to 5 sentences or phrases, then ask yourself,
"How can I use this on a day-to-day basis?" Think of examples that illustrate and
support your interpretation of the case. Find examples that contradict the prevailing
position. Quantify your position. Inspect extreme solutions first. Be prepared to respond
to a very simple question at all times, “Why do you recommend we do that?”
CLASS COMMUNICATION
I will communicate with you outside of class through email or Canvas announcements.
You are responsible for checking your email/Canvas on a regular basis and are
responsible for the content of those emails. Failure to check your email does not excuse
you from meeting the responsibilities outlined in the message.
Conversely, email is an excellent way for you to communicate with me. I will respond to
your email within 24 hours of receiving it on weekdays or by Monday evening if I receive
it on the weekend. Many times I will email you back much faster.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS
The Syllabus, Course Calendar, and additional materials will be posted on Canvas. All
assignments will be submitted on Canvas.
The schedule is tentative and can change. You are responsible for all changes to the
schedule as announced in class and/or on Canvas.
Measure individual performance with a subjective evaluation of participation and
preparedness.
The narrative portions of the Murphy, Cunningham, and Stavchansky Lewis text are
very short and to the point, reflective of the fact that this course integrates information
and concepts presented in depth by prerequisite courses. Class discussions will require
your total command of the text material. A demonstrated command of the material
coupled with a clear, concise, active presentation style is required to score above average
on this dimension.
Significant emphasis is placed on class participation, especially questions,
comments, and discussion among peers. You must strike a balance between passive,
silent listening and dominating the discussion with ill-conceived or trivial remarks.
Neither of these two extreme positions is acceptable. Neither earns you many
participation points. Come prepared; take a stand. A lively discussion among peers is
the objective. Air your ideas. Rebut others.
Thorough preparation and concise expression are valued. Quality outweighs quantity.
Enthusiasm counts. Contribute, don’t disrupt. Ask questions. There are no dumb or


wrong questions. Throughout your academic career you’ve heard this phrase. But in
ADV370J/PR367, it is imperative that you believe it. This course is filled with
uncertainty, inadequate information and not enough time. If you refrain from asking
questions, you limit your exposure to fresh insights from others.
Measure individual group participation with a structured peer evaluation system.
Learning to write peer evaluations is a key management skill. Early in your career you
will be on the receiving end of many such evaluations. Later, you will be required to
assess the professional performance of subordinates in measurable, precisely
articulated, easily understood terms. You will begin your understanding of this difficult
management task with this required assignment.
Measure individual problem solving and writing skills with case brief assignments.
The core of this course revolves around case brief analyses. A premium is placed on the
development of quantitative dimensions in support of case solutions. Out of the nine
cases we’ll discuss this semester, you must submit an individual case brief analysis for
four of them. And one of those cases CANNOT be the case you present for your
management team presentation/analysis.
Measure management team performance based on major management team analyses
and presentations.
COURSE EVALUATION
Participation (1.5 points each)     30
Attendance (.5 points X 40)         20
Team Peer Evaluation                15
Individual Case Briefs* (4)         120
Written Team Analysis               30
Team Presentation                   35
TOTAL                               250 points
_______________________________________________________
*You have the option of re-writing one individual case brief, due on the
last class day. This is an option, not a requirement. If you’re satisfied with
your individual case brief points, then no need to re-write one. If you’re
not, then you can submit a re-do.
Please note that this option CANNOT replace the written team analysis or
team class presentation. NOR can it substitute for missing an individual
case brief due throughout the semester.
Also note that extra credit will NOT be offered.
Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric. The instructor may
use plus and minus grades, following this range:


A = 94-100%
A- = 90-93
B+ = 87-89
B = 84-86
B- = 80-83
C+ = 77-79
C = 74-76
C- = 70-73
D+ = 67-69
D = 64-66
D- = 60-63
F = 0-60
WRITING FLAG COURSE
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write
regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive
feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the
opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and
discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your
grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core
Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and
Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
MOODY COLLEGE WRITING SUPPORT PROGRAM
The Moody College Writing Support Program, located in BMC 3.322,
https://moody.utexas.edu/students/moodywriting, offers one-on-one assistance
without charge to undergraduates seeking to improve their professional writing in all
fields of communication. We have student specialists in Journalism, RTF, CSD, CMS,
Communication & Leadership and PR & Advertising. In addition, we offer workshops to
strengthen core writing skills in each field and to inspire students to strive for
excellence. Students may guarantee their time by booking half-hour appointments on
our website for assistance during all stages of the writing process. Writing coaches also
will take drop-ins if they are not working with appointments.
CLASSROOM CONDUCT
Cell phones must be silenced at the beginning of each class. Students may not take calls
or answer text and email messages during class time unless it is a dire, life-threatening
emergency. Those who violate this policy will be asked to leave the classroom for the
remainder of the class period and will be marked absent. Private conversations are not
permitted during lectures and in-class discussions.
COURSE STANDARDS AND DEADLINES
    • All reading material and project assignments are to be completed before class
        meetings. It helps the quality of class discussion as well as your level of
        understanding.


    •   Attendance is required at all class, presentation, and account team meetings.
        Given the nature of the class, wherein marketing communication account teams
        make up an essential portion of the course, significant absence from class, team,
        and other meetings can reduce your final grade in the course by up to two letter
        grades (see participation grade).
    •   Management team analyses, individual case briefs, and peer evaluations are due
        on the scheduled date and time, unless otherwise specified. Late assignments
        are scored 0. Turn in assignments early if you have a conflict with the deadline.
    •   Team presentations are to be presented using Microsoft Office’s PowerPoint or
        another professional presentation program.
    •   All work created outside the classroom must be produced on a personal computer
        and be professional in appearance. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors
        will result in a loss of points.
    •   Any questions or arguments about a grade must be presented in writing within
        seven (7) days after the points are posted or returned.
