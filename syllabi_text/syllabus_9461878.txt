                         COMMUNICATION WITH PATIENTS
I.       STANDARDIZED COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course is offered as an undergraduate level to learn information and skills related to
effective communication between patients and healthcare providers as a cornerstone to
enhancing patient outcomes. Experiential and applied learning models allow students to work
throughout the semester in diverse teams. The course will employ a flipped classroom to allow
students to be informed and ready to engage in classroom activities. Prior to class sessions
students will have assigned readings and written assignments to complete. The goals of the
course are to explore communication between patients and healthcare providers; to give students
skills that allow them to best communicate about goals of care, quality of life, and care consistent
with patient and family goals and wishes; to give students a greater understanding impact of
illness on patients and families; and to explore narrative medicine, and reflective professional
practice. Course content will include a student review of provider, patient, and family
perspectives on topics and will promote competency in social work and other professional
healthcare professional ethics. The importance of cultural and linguistic competency is
intentionally woven throughout the curriculum. This course relies on class sessions that promote
experiential learning including information gathering, group learning, case review and
application, individual reflection, and group problem solving.
II.      STANDARDIZED COURSE OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Demonstrate knowledge, attitudes, and skills to show an applicable understanding of Narrative
Medicine, including recalling and identifying associated concepts.
2. Demonstrate the ability to appreciate, contrast, and compare a range of perspectives on
healthcare communication, including provider, patient, and family.
3. Appreciate the importance of techniques and skills related to communication.
4. Identify and classify ethical concepts related to patient and provider narratives.
5. Develop knowledge, attitudes, and skills that reflect a professional and compassionate stance
toward patients and families.
                                                   1


6. Demonstrate the ability to problem-solve with patients and families in role-play scenarios.
7. Develop the capacity to absorb, metabolize, and interpret stories of illness and disability.
8. Identify and classify intellectual and scientific consensus and evidence about emergent
narrative theory and practice.
9. Identify and critique the impact of the dominant and societal narrative on illness, disability,
and dying.
10. Design and co-present a semester-long, group project to demonstrate mastery and ability to
apply narrative and communication concepts.
III.    TEACHING METHODS
The course will employ a flipped classroom to allow students to be informed and ready to engage
in classroom activities. Prior to class sessions students will have assigned readings and written
assignments to complete. The goals of the course are to explore narrative, communication, inter-
professional work, illness in society, and reflective practice. A comprehensive view of
communication and narrative that includes many perspectives will be introduced through lecture
and student research. Students will be asked to engage in strategic and integrated classes that
incorporate group and experiential learning techniques, case study, and discussion. Teaching
methods assume construction of knowledge through dialogue and other means of presenting
diverse perspectives.
IV.     REQUIRED TEXTS AND MATERIALS
All required articles and texts can be found in file folders on Canvas. Students do not need a
textbook or other purchased texts for this class. However, students will need a dedicated journal
or notebook to be used only for short, in-class critical and reflective writing assignments.

VI. CLASSROOM POLICIES
The class experience is co-constructed and students are expected to attend class regularly and to
participate in an interactive framework between collegiate students and professor. Students are
expected to complete the readings prior to class and should be well prepared to participate in
discussions and experiential learning assignments. Failure to attend class and demonstrate through
discussions that one has comprehended the readings will be considered in assigning the final grade.
Punctuality is an important professional practice. Class will begin promptly at 3:30 p.m. Students
should make every effort to arrive on time. Late arrivals can disrupt the class process.
Students will be allowed one unexcused absence. If a student misses more than the allotted excused
absence, the professor reserves the right to lower that student’s final grade by one point for each
class missed beyond the one allowed. If a student is going to be absent, efforts should be made to
contact the professor in advance. Students are responsible for any material missed due to absence.
2. Except in the case of extended emergencies, and then only with the permission of the professor,
late
assignments will not be accepted without penalty. Students are expected to turn in all required
assignments on the agreed upon due date at the beginning of class. Assignments turned in after
class starts will be considered late. If accepted, late assignments will be assessed point penalties at
the rate of three (3) points each day late. If the due date is a problem, the student should see the
professor and negotiate another due date well in advance.
3. If students are concerned about their class performance, the professor is more than willing to
work with them to help improve their understanding of the class material of the assignments prior
to the end of the semester. Final grades assigned in the course are not negotiable.
4. The ability to write in a professional manner is very important for healthcare professionals,
particularly in the medical setting where they are working closely with a range of healthcare
professionals. Written work must be typed, edited for grammatical, spelling and typographical
errors. Work will be grade based on the American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines
for references and citations.
5. Student feedback is welcome. Students are also encouraged to provide feedback during office
hours, by phone, e-mail, or appointment.
6. All students are expected to maintain confidentiality regarding all shared professional and
personal
                                                    3


information related to agencies, clients, or the experiences of other students, as required by Section
1.07 of the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics.
VII.     UNIVERSITY POLICIES
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HONOR CODE. The core values of The University of Texas
at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility.
Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty,
trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND CIVILITY IN THE CLASSROOM. The professor
expects students to act as professionals in class. This means students should arrive on time for
class, be prepared to participate in the class discussion, and show respect for one another’s
opinions. A course brings together a group of diverse individuals with various backgrounds.
Students are influenced and shaped by such factors as ethnicity, gender, sex, physical abilities,
religious and political beliefs, national origins, and sexual orientations, among others. We expect
to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. Social
Work also deals with complex and controversial issues. These issues may be challenging and
uncomfortable, and it would be impossible to offer a substantive classroom experience that did
not include potentially difficult conversations relating to challenging issues. In this environment
we will be exposed to diverse ideas and opinions, and sometimes we will not agree with the ideas
expressed by others. Nevertheless, the professor requires that students engage one another with
civility, respect, and professionalism.
UNANTICIPATED DISTRESS. Students may experience unexpected and/or distressing
reactions to course readings, videos, conversations, and assignments. If so, students are
encouraged to inform the professor. The professor can be responsive and supportive regarding
students’ participation in course assignments and activities, but students are responsible for
communicating clearly what kind of support is desired. If counseling is needed, students may
contact a service provider of their choosing, including the UT Counseling Center at 512-471-
3515 or online at https://cmhc.utexas.edu/.
POLICY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION. Public social
networks are not private. Even when open only to approved or invited members, users cannot be
certain that privacy will exist among the general membership of sites. If social work students
choose to participate in such forums, please assume that anything posted can be seen, read, and
critiqued. What is said, posted, linked to, commented on, uploaded, subscribed to, etc., can be
accessed and archived, posing potential harm to professional reputations and prospective careers.
Students who use social media (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and other forms of electronic
communication (i.e. blogs, etc.) must be mindful of how their communication may be perceived
by clients, colleagues, faculty, and others. Students are expected to make every effort to
minimize material which could be considered inappropriate for a professional students in
training. Because of this, students are advised to manage security settings at their most private
                                                    4


levels and avoid posting information/photos or using any language that could jeopardize their
professional image.
Students are asked to consider the amount of personal information posted on these sites and are
obliged to block any client access to involvement in the students’ social networks. Client
material should not be referred to in any form of electronic media, including any information that
might lead to the identification of a client or compromise client confidentiality in any way.
Additionally, students must critically evaluate any material that is posted regarding community
agencies and professional relationships, as certain material could violate the standards set by the
Steve Hicks School of Social Work, the Texas Code of Conduct for Social Workers, and/or the
NASW Code of Ethics.
Students should consider that they will be representing professional social work practice as well
as The University of Texas at Austin Steve Hicks School of Social Work program while in the
classroom, the university community, and the broader area communities.
POLICY ON SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all
students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. For further information, the student may refer to the Web Site of the Student Judicial
Services, Office of the Dean of Students: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.
USE OF COURSE MATERIALS. The materials used in this course, including, but not limited
to exams, quizzes, and homework assignments, are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized
duplication of the course materials is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary
action being taken against the student. Additionally, the sharing of course materials without the
specific, express approval of the professor may be a violation of the University’s Student Honor
Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action. This
sharing includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of
distributing those materials to other current or future students.
DOCUMENTED DISABILITY STATEMENT. Any student who requires special
accommodations must obtain a letter that documents the disability from the Services for Students
with Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement (471- 6259 voice
or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). A student should present the letter
to the professor at the beginning of the semester so that needed accommodations can be
discussed and followed. The student should remind the professor of any testing accommodations
no later than five business days before an exam. For more information,
visit: http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/.
CAMPUS CARRY. Information on The University’s policy on concealed firearms (Campus
Carry) may be found here: https://campuscarry.utexas.edu/
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS. By UT Austin policy, students must notify the professor of a
pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If
                                                   5


the student must miss a class, examination, work assignment, or project in order to observe a
religious holy day, the professor will give the student an opportunity to complete the missed
work within a reasonable time after the absence.
TITLE IX REPORTING. In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,
The University of Texas at Austin is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is
free from discriminatory conduct based on gender. Faculty, instructors, agency-based field
instructors, staff, and/or teaching assistants in their supervisory roles are mandated reporters of
incidents of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual violence, or sexual
misconduct. Students who report such incidents will be informed of University resources.
Incidents will be reported to the University’s Title IX Coordinator and/or the Title IX Liaison for
the SHSSW, Professor Tanya Voss. Students, faculty and staff may contact Professor Voss to
report incidents or to obtain information. Further information, including student resources related
to Title IX, may also be found at http://socialwork.utexas.edu/dl/files/academic-
programs/other/qrg-sexualharassment.pdf.
CLASSROOM CONFIDENTIALITY. Information shared in class about agencies, clients, and
personal matters is considered confidential per the NASW Code of Ethics on educational
supervision and is protected by regulations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA) as well. As such, sharing this information with individuals outside of the educational
context is not permitted. Violations of confidentiality could result in actions taken according to
the policies and procedure for review of academic performance located in sections 3.0, 3.1, and
3.2 of the Standards for Social Work Education.
USE OF E-MAIL FOR OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE TO STUDENTS. Email is
recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, students are responsible
for reading their email for university and course-related information and announcements.
Students are responsible for keeping the university informed about a change of e-mail address.
Students should check their e-mail regularly and frequently—daily, but at minimum twice a
week—to stay current with university-related communications, some of which may be time-
sensitive. Students can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating their e-mail
address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
SAFETY. As part of professional social work education, students may have assignments that
involve working in agency settings and/or the community. As such, these assignments may
present some risks. Sound choices and caution may lower risks inherent to the profession. It is
the student's responsibility to be aware of and adhere to policies and practices related to agency
and/or community safety. Students should notify the professor regarding any safety concerns.
BEHAVIOR CONCERNS ADVICE LINE (BCAL). If students are worried about someone
who is acting differently, they may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone
their concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a
partnership between the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health
Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police
Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
