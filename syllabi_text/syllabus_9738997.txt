             D E S C R I P T I O N :
             The Theory of Architecture sequence in the School of Architecture begins, in Theory I, with recent buildings, then
moves to a history of canonical writings about buildings in Theory II (Theory III, a required elective, allows you to pursue your
own interests). Most schools put the canonical readings first, then move to examples. But central to our curriculum is a basic
argument: it helps to understand how buildings carry meaning before you discuss what kinds of meaning buildings carry.
             Aside from my section, there are also sections taught by Professor Larry Speck and Professor Martin Haettasch.
Though all three sections focus on relatively recent architecture, each reflects the particular concerns of the instructor – another
hallmark of this school. Professor Speck’s section, for example, tends to focus on the body of works of individual architects, and
also studies what the architects say or write about their own work; my section looks at single buildings, and tries to define what
each architect is doing not through their words but through the way those buildings frame experience. Each approach has
advantages and disadvantages – but all are among the most highly ranked courses in the SOA (they are limited to approximately
equal enrollment and have equivalent work loads).
             Central to my course is the proposition that a building is less about the architect’s concerns and more precisely a
justified negotiation about how form can best structure specific meaningfulness with regard to an individual problem that is
resolved with a building, about which the architect may well have a strong opinion, which will take its critical stance in the form of
the building, rather than the architect’s words. Many people think that a building is primarily about the architect’s autobiography
— whatever an architect wants to do! — rather than the specific circumstances that make buildings possible at all. But buildings
are expensive things, rarely made just because the architect wanted it that way. So, in this class, we are less interested in the
architect’s words (which often disguise what an architect is actually doing: architects say all kinds of nonsense in order to build
what they think is right!) than in the world of experience a building organizes for its inhabitants, since that is what an architect has
to justify.
             In this scenario theory is not something applied to a building. Theory in this course (and, to be clear, there are other
conceptions of theory) is what you form when you attempt to cohesively order the sensate condition of dwelling within that
building: you struggle to explain why, and, in so doing, posit a framework of meaningfulness. Your intelligence seeks to give
order to the knowledge of experience, and that giving some understandable order is the main kind of theory in this class.


               The first aim of this course is to have you look at buildings to the extent you can through the available
documentation, imagine their inhabitation, and try to value their singular meaning. This is theory as the consequence of a verb: to
theorize. Central to this aim is the notion that, when you progress into Theory II, you will have an idea of how written theories
make the jump to the inhabited framework of experience that buildings offer. Theory so conceived has a primary agenda: to
explain a building to itself. This differs from a second type of theory that you will encounter in architecture school: explaining
buildings to each other as proofs of cultural tendencies.
               The second goal of this course is to explore, through a range of case studies, the major directions that architecture,
as a cultural activity, has taken over the past (almost) half-century, starting with the collapse of the Modern. In so doing the
course hopes to allow you to link your singular understanding of artifacts to larger cultural developments of the present day, to
ask: why is the meaning I sense in the building actually meaningful? This is an important bit of activity. We are going to look
closely at some twelve to fourteen recent buildings, and indirectly study some twenty to thirty more. You will see that “value” is
clearly an important component of architectural work, but “value” is evolving constantly: it hardly stands still long enough to
adequately describe.
               The past four decades in architecture differ from the full century immediately leading up in that the recent past has
not been ruled by the sorts of dogmatic theories and movements that to a great degree defined the 20th century. There is no
common agreement about where recent architecture has gone, much less how it can be considered meaningful. That does not
mean the architecture of the recent past does not have consistency – of course it does, just look at it! – but this consistency does
not stem from any single agreed upon agenda. This is what Rafael Moneo means when he writes (in one of the required books
for this course) that architecture of the recent past lacks a theory, that it is instead driven by a series of anxious strategies.
               Really what we will be looking at are different arguments about meaningfulness. Each of the buildings chosen for the
course is exemplary of certain primary concerns present in architectural discourse today. But the list is only partial, and, to be
sure, it partly reflects my understanding of what is most important (which – to remind you – is the basis of the studio agenda here
as well: the instructors confront you with their agendas in an attempt for you to define your own).
               F O R M A T :
               Every week, in open, free-form discussions, we are going to try to figure out the “why” of an individual building*
based on the idea that the building is first and foremost a frame for inhabitation, an actual solution to a complex actual problem,
not really about the architect’s style, but about how the architects' vision makes sense. You will familiarize yourself with the
building and the reference buildings before class (about which be sure and see about “think pad” below), and, in order to insure


this, the class will be broken into discussion groups, which will be asked to turn in “minutes” of your discussions. Every week we
will you an open question to help guide your discussions, but the question is only meant as a prompt.
              You will be asked to imagine yourself dwelling in the buildings, and to work as detectives might search for evidence;
parts not understood (“I wouldn’t have done it that way”) or too easily accepted; seeming inconsistencies, etc. The evidence is
gathered in group and seminar discussion and the class attempts to reconstruct each building's conceptual underpinnings in a
form of synthetic police work – evidence to motive – based on close reading. Our reconstructions will then be compared with a
writings about the building (sometimes the architect's own writings) in order to map out internally and externally developed
theoretical models. The format sounds formal, but it is loose and free-flowing, and the discussions are wide-ranging, exploratory,
challenging, and really interesting.
              Up to five types of readings may be given for each building: 1. drawings and photographs of the building in question;
2. a written description of the building, site, client, etc.; 3. an essay placing the building or its point of departure within a general
critical context; 4. Images of up to three other buildings that are engaged in similar issues – what we are calling “reference
buildings”; and, sometimes, 5. an essay, while not necessarily about the building, which expands and explores its critical context.
              I will post the images (which may include websites), and many of the readings, on BOX for you to access. There are
five books that you will need to buy or read on reserve for this course (if you buy them, get them at Amazon, where they will be
cheapest - they are expensive, but worth it, and these are basic readings that you really should own):
              1. Rafael Moneo: Theoretical Anxiety and Design Strategies in the Work of Eight Contemporary Architects. This is
the primary text, written by a great architect and teacher. Though it covers the work of eight contemporary architects, its purpose
in this course is to give you a basic appreciation of the work that immediately precedes the present by a half-generation. In
Theory II you will just make it to that moment! Moneo’s chapters serve as a perfect counterpart to the course: each describes the
horizontal development of the architects’ work. In contrast, we will be working in a sense perpendicular to these writings,
plumbing each building not as a proof of the architect’s intentions, but as a specific framework of experience that in turn suggests
how meaning is ordered. You should be able to get this used.
              2. Rem Koolhaas: Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan. The last real attempt at an
architectural manifesto: you can’t move ahead without ingesting its argument (and it is a fun read), which is far more serious than
the apparent perversity of the text seems to suggest. You can definitely get this used.
              3. Herzog & De Meuron: Prada Aoyama Tokyo. Currently out of print, so you will have to read it in the library unless
you want to cough up the cash. Pricey, but extraordinary, this is perhaps the best book out there describing a design process,
and also the curious dispassionate-ness of the design process that so many architects use today (compared, to say, The
Fountainhead). Beyond invaluable.


              4. William McDonough and Michael Braungart: Cradle to Cradle. The whole crisis of sustainability and aesthetics is
just beginning to come to a head. This book sets out the problem as clearly as possible. You should be able to get this used.
              5. Peter Zumthor, Thinking Architecture. This is a book you will see on many architect’s desks. Zumthor’s ideas
resonate with many people in the school, and professors will refer to this text so often that you just need to read it. You should be
able to get this used.
              In addition, you may wish to obtain Peter Eisenman’s Ten Canonical Buildings. This text will serve you well for the
formal analysis assignment; beyond that, it is interesting, but the form of analysis is exactly the OPPOSITE of what we will be
focusing on in this class.
              The work associated with this class will be announced at the start of the semester, and will involve, beyond the
weekly minutes and work in the think pads, a graphic analysis and written paper on a recent building. Class participation in
discussion is the other primary factor in grades for this course.
              *Some weeks we will look at two buildings; when we come to OMA I will ask you to make oral presentations of
buildings by that office as a means to discuss the content of Delirious New York.
              E V A L U A T I O N :
              Your grade for this course will be assigned on the basis of:
              - Paper                                                        30%
              - Participation                                                30%
              - Tentative Manifesto                                          20%
              - Minutes                                                      10%
              - Think sketchbook                                             10%
              The primary assignment for this course - an analysis paper of a recent building or buildings not included in the class
- will be broken into two parts and spread across the semester. The written paper will be +/- 3,000 words. I will also ask you to
undertake a "tentative manifesto," which I will explain in class.
              Class participation is key to your grade: you must take part – that means: talk. Attendance is mandatory. One class
session is the equivalent of two normal classes, so two absences will constitute a letter grade drop, and with three absences you
will be stricken from the roll. Minutes and possible short exercises will account for another 10% of the grade. Finally, and
critically, you must keep a “think pad” for this course: a dedicated sketchbook that you use to draw the buildings as we study
them. It is not enough to look at photos: you have map the building, draw its section, diagram its logic, reconstruct its details.
This form of “studying by hand” will be critical to your success in understanding architecture. I will pick up think pads twice during
the semester.


              Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class schedules. You must notify each of your instructors as far in
advance as possible prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a religious holy day.
              The UT Honor Code applies to all work undertaken in this course. Here it is:
              “The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through
integrity, honesty, trust, fairness and respect toward peers and community.”
              You must also review the University website about plagiarism: it is useful about what is expected in terms of
identification of sources: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_plagiarism.php
              From that website, please review the link about Academic Integrity, and the consequences of Academic Dishonesty.

              Students with disabilities who require special accommodations need to get a letter that documents the disability from
the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of the Dean of Students (471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users
who are deaf or hard of hearing). This letter should be presented to the instructor in each course at the beginning of the
semester and accommodations needed should be discussed at that time. Five business days before an exam the student should
remind the instructor of any testing accommodations that will be needed.
