This lecture course is intended to provide a broad knowledge of major issues in the
history of American design and architecture from about 1880 to the present. The
central assumption of the course is that our environments both shape us and reflect
what manner of people we are. The word design is understood to include all elements of
the built environment, ranging from the smallest artifacts and products through buildings
(whether vernacular or elite) to the shape of suburban and urban landscapes. Students
are encouraged to consider design in the context of social and cultural history, and as it
relates to issues of functionality, civic responsibility, and community engagement on
both regional and global levels. Among topics to be considered are methods of cultural
analysis of material artifacts; the rise, triumph, and fall of functionalism and the
International Style; the emergence of uniquely American varieties of commercial design
in a consumer society; the interactions of technology, economics, and design; the
impact of the automobile on all levels of design; the rise of postmodern design and
deconstructive architecture as counters to the modernist tradition; and design for the
information age. Among problems to be considered and discussed are tensions between
tradition and novelty, between functional and expressive theories of design, between
elite ideologies and popular desires, and between European and American design.
Although lectures are well illustrated, this is not an image memorization course. Rather,
students will need to develop critical thinking skills about what design means in society
through the analysis, evaluation, and synthesis of material presented and discussed in
class, through reading assignments, through a paper that emphasizes individual inquiry
and analysis, and in exams. AMS 330 satisfies the core curriculum requirement in Visual
and Performing Arts; if you register under ARH 339Q or URB 352, consult with your
major advisor to be certain you receive proper credit.
Required reading:
Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture
Carma Gorman, The Industrial Design Reader
Jeffrey Meikle, Design in the USA
John Kasson, Amusing the Million
The Project on Vegas, Strip Cultures
Required texts are available at the University Co-op. Sometime during the semester you
should spend a couple of hours browsing through the Architecture Library in Battle Hall.
Current periodicals are located in the most comfortable reading room at UT. Books on


                                                                                             2
architecture and design are on two compact levels. The Fine Arts Library, which is also a
quiet, comfortable place, has many books and periodicals on design and the decorative
arts. However, it was recently shrunk and is under threat of permanent closure. Get
acquainted with it before the books are moved to PCL and offsite storage. Obtaining
true value from this course requires looking outward from lectures and required reading
to the objects, structures, and spaces of the real world around us—and exploring what
has been written on those aspects that interest or fascinate you. The web has an
inconceivable wealth of visual materials on every design-related topic. However,
narrative depth and analytic insight are available mostly only in print sources held by
UT's often ignored libraries, and there are millions of phenomenal images that have never
been digitized but are easily accessible.
Required written work includes two in-class exams (the first counts 15% of the final
grade; the second counts 25%), a paper of 5-7 pages based on original observation
(counts 30%), and a final exam (30%). Final grades are reported with pluses and
minuses.
The first exam counts only 15% because it is intended to familiarize you with the
process. Exams are cumulative in the sense that they assume a working knowledge of
prior course material. However, the emphasis in exams two and three is on material
covered since the previous exam. Exams include short identifications and longer essays.
You are expected to synthesize material from lectures and assigned readings, and when
possible to refer to outside reading and personal observation.
Reading assignments should be completed before class on the date for which they are
listed. Sometimes the readings are directly related to that day's lecture; sometimes they
are scheduled simply to spread the assignments throughout the semester. Readings
often include material that will not be referred to in lectures; you are responsible for it all
the same. A premium is placed on efforts to understand the course material on your own
terms, to use it as raw material for your own interpretations. Make-up exams will not be
given except in documented cases of dire emergency.
Guidelines for the paper assignment will be provided later. You will be asked to write
about the social and cultural meanings of a product, artifact, object, building, interior, or
space with which you are personally familiar. Several short articles intended to suggest
possible models for the paper will be made available later in the semester. Late papers
will be marked down one full letter from the grade they would otherwise have received,
except in cases of dire emergency. No credit is given for papers more than one week
late. The paper is due in class on April 23.
Attendance will be taken daily through a sign-in sheet. It is your responsibility to make
sure you sign in before you leave the classroom each day. A student who misses no
more than two class periods will have the earned final course grade increased by one
degree (for example, C+ to B-). A student who misses four or more class meetings will
have the earned final course grade decreased by one degree (for example, B- to C+).
Excused absences are awarded only in the case of documented personal emergency or
by prior approval for educational conferences, organized athletic competition, or similar
reasons. The instructor, not the TA, must approve excused absences.


                                                                                           3
Much of the lecture material is not information that can be memorized by rote but
consists of the instructor's personal interpretations, which you are expected to assess
for yourself and use as a springboard to your own interpretations. I place a premium on
independent thinking—which is easier to arrive at if you've been attending class.
Use of cell phones, whether for calls, texting, or Internet access, is prohibited. Use of
tablets and laptops for Internet access is also prohibited. Such use is distracting to
those sitting nearby, and anyone observed doing so will be asked to leave class.
If you plan to miss a class or exam for religious observance, please notify the instructor
at least a week in advance and you will be given an opportunity to complete missed work
within a reasonable time after the absence.
You are expected to abide by the University Code of Conduct and the Student Honor
Code, which are both stated here:
"The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
toward peers and community."
"As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of
the University and uphold academic integrity."
If you have any uncertainty as to what constitutes cheating or intellectual dishonesty,
please see the official eleven-point definition at http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-
information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-conduct/. They will not be
tolerated and are grounds for course failure.
Upon request the University provides appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean
of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY. If you know you will be requesting an
accommodation, please submit your letter during the first two weeks of the semester.
Please attend to the following statement from the Office of Campus Safety and Security
regarding emergencies: "Occupants of buildings on the UT campus are required to
evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
requires exiting and assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each
classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not
be the one you used when entering the building. Students requiring assistance in
evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class. In the
event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors."
