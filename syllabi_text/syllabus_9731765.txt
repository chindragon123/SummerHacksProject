Attendance Policy:
Regular attendance and participation are essential and expected. Random attendance will be taken throughout
the semester by various means and it can affect your grade up to 10% (participation grade). "A student who is
absent from a class or examination for the observance of a religious holy day may complete the work issued
within a reasonable time after the absence, if proper notice has been given". The deadline for notification of such
an absence is 14 days prior to the class absence.
Class Participation:
It is important that you are familiar with the course material as the course evolves. Your ability to answer
questions and discuss the material will be part of the overall participation evaluation. Short quizzes will be given
occasionally at the beginning of a class, the average of which will constitute 10% of your final grade. Therefore,
you should come always prepared to class.
Assignments:
Homework assignments are a central part of this course. Homework will be assigned approximately five times
over the course of the semester. All assignments are due at the beginning of the class for the assigned day.
Homework assignments should be completed individually.
Final Project Description:
There will be one final project assigned at the end of October, and it will relate to a design of HVAC system for a
commercial or residential building. It will be a group project and student will have a choice to select specific
building and HVAC system. Each group will prepare a two page proposal to define the project objectives, scope,
methodology, and deliverables. Students are welcome to propose problems from their current research or future
career. Based on these proposals the course instructor will refine the final project scope and deliverables for each
group, so that each student will have the same final project work load. Each group member will have the same
project grade.
Midterm Exam:
This course will have two midterm exams.
Final Exam:
This course will not have a final exam. The final project and the final project presentation will replace the final
exam.
Due Dates Policy:
All assignments are due at the beginning of class; those turned in late will count 10% off per day.
Personal Problems:
If you have illness or personal problems that will affect your performance during the course of the semester,
please let me know as soon as possible. “After the fact” provides little protection unless there are extreme
circumstances. I have an answering machine and an e-mail address if you need to get in touch with me after
hours. Do not hesitate to use them.

Dropping the Course:
From the 1st through the 12th class day, an undergraduate student can drop a course via the web and receive a
refund, if eligible. From the 13th through the university’s academic drop deadline, a student may Q drop a
course with approval from the Dean, and departmental advisor. After the academic drop deadline has passed, a
student may drop a course only with Dean’s approval, and only for urgent, substantiated, non-academic reasons.
Course Evaluations:
An evaluation of the course and instructor will be conducted at the end of the semester using the approved UT
Course/Instructor evaluation forms.
