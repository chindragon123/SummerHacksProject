context and objectives
2D Digital Production Art is designed to provide basic animation foundations and targeted instruction for artists wanting to expand
their research into advanced or specific types of 2D Digital Art techniques and process. This course is designed as an introductory
to intermediate course offering before entering Intermediate // Advanced 2D Digital Art Production. Utilizing the student’s exist-
ing digital and traditional skillsets, the course will examine the technical and conceptual aspects of 2D digital art, animation with 2D
pen and pencil drawings, video/film documentation and presentation. Advanced topics and use of Photoshop, Painter, Audition, and
After Effects for animation, sound editing, and scripting of storyboards. This course will expand the student’s existing digital skills and
further develop them to produce a clear and well-conceived understanding of digital production processes and a learned vocabulary
of animation and its respective nomenclature.
This course will develop concepts and skills by addressing assigned assignments and conceptual problems. These assigned problems
or “project modules” will help the student creatively consider the interaction of media, imagery, composition, content, and digital
manipulation methods. Weekly individual technical and conceptual growth will be applied to each module and also factored into the
student’s final grade. The Work Ethic and Participation module grade will be for the instructor’s use and is discretionary.
Research topics and readings are to be expected. Participation in assignments and class is expected and mandatory. Expect addi-
tional work outside of the specified class time. Expect additional Internet tutorials. With the exception of the grade and attendance
policies, parts of this syllabus are subject to change with advance notice, as deemed necessary or appropriate by the instructor.
project modules and assignments
These modules will be based on lectures, technical demonstrations, assignments, research and tutorials, and a creative project. Stu-
dents will collaborate together in groups and also work individually on projects. In addition to the discussions of the formal concep-
tual and technical content of the class, broad dialogue may occur regarding technology and art and its social and historical context.
This may include the expression of thoughts, experience and concepts of contemporary and historical individuals and events. Self-
expression is to be expected and explored both visually and verbally.
1) Animation Assignments - Exploration into animation basics and respective digital processing. Assignments include:
       Flipbook - analog exploration - (YOU!) constitutes 10% grade
       Stop Motion - framerates and production - (Ps/Pr) constitutes 10% grade
       Animated Gif - video layers, alpha channels, and image sequences - (Pr/Ps) constitutes 10% grade
       Rotoscope - frame-by-frame animation, onion skinning, and tweening - (Ps/Ae/Ai/Pa) constitutes 10% grade
       Rocket Launch - extended exploration into After Effects and temporal graphs - (Ae/Ps/Ai) constitutes 10% grade		
       Puppet - basic character animation and puppet rigging - (Ae/Ps/Ai) constitutes 10% of averaged grade
       Kinetic Type - exploration into After Effects and typography - (Ae/Ps/Ai) constitutes 10% of averaged grade
                 Completion and critical analysis of the assignments will constitute 70% of your cumulative grade. The sum of these
                 conceptual assignments will be your mid-term grade. You will have class time to privately discuss this with the instructor.
2) Technical/Conceptual Projects - A two-part exploration into abstract/conceptual animation art and technical virtual environ-
mental design, digital composition, and collaborative workflow. Advanced 2D digital imaging/animation and presentation techniques
will be utilized and employed by both individuals and teams. A final group discussion will be held per project. Both the Technical and
Conceptual projects will constitute 20% of your cumulative grade.
3) Work Ethic and Participation (Critical Thinking, Individual Progress, and ‘playing nice with others’): Development of a good work
ethic, a learned vocabulary, digital multi-tasking applied to collaborative critical thinking and developed digital technical skills. Discre-
tionary for determination of individual growth in both technical and conceptual thinking and application. This module will be on-going
throughout the semester and will constitute 10% of your cumulative grade.
Canvas and course schedule: In this class I use Canvas - a Web-based course management system with password-protected access
through UT Direct - distribute course materials, to communicate and collaborate online, to post grades, to submit assignments, and
to give you online quizzes and surveys. You can find support in using Canvas at the ITS Help Desk at 475-9400, Monday through
Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., so plan accordingly.


storage, media, service requirements & recommendations
Each student will need to purchase/have available the following for the course:
Personal Laptop (From your admissions advising)
Wacom (or similar) Drawing Tablet and Stylus
Internet Access and a Working E-mail Address
Adobe Creative Cloud Master Collection
USB Flash/Thumb drive(s) and/or Portable External hard disk drive(s)
Cloud Storage Access (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
**backup of your data is solely your responsibility and should be done daily to avoid loss of any work**
use of e-mail for official correspondence to students
All students should become familiar with the University’s official e-mail student notification policy. It is the student’s responsibil-
ity to keep the University informed as to changes in his or her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent
and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be
time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this policy and
instructions for updating your e-mail address are available at http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564
grades and grading policy
Each student will receive seven module grades for the semester. The grades will be based on completion of particular projects and
assignments throughout the duration of the course. Students will be evaluated on comprehension of specific terminology, grasp of
course technology, presentation, aesthetic development and conceptual growth. Collaboration with others students will be expected
and factors of attendance and class participation will be extremely important to each project’s grade.
Grading in a creative course is inevitably subjective, meaning that the final evaluation of the work pre­sented is based on how the cri-
teria for the assignments is met and on the opinion of the instructor as to the work’s quality. The following offers some of the criteria
used in determining grades. Grades will be based upon the criteria of Concept, Technical Skills, Participation and Work Ethics, Presen-
tation and Craft, and Critical Thinking.
          A+/- means outstanding work exceeding the requirements in both quantity and quality. A clear and complete understanding
          of techniques and processes is evidenced. Significant participation in critiques has occurred. Finished and fully developed work
          is innovative and well presented.
          B+/- means good work beyond the requirements. Good understanding of techniques and processes is evidenced.
          Individual approach has formed.
          C+/- means average work. Requirements are met; projects are completed on time. Regular attendance is maintained. Ad		
          equate participation in critiques and understanding of techniques and processes is evidenced.
          D+/- means poor work. Requirements barely met, understanding of techniques and processes lacking. Skill level low.
          F means unacceptable work. Requirements not met. Little understanding of techniques or processes.
          Grading System Scale:
          A           = 4.00     C        = 2.00
          A-          = 3.67     C-       = 1.67
          B+          = 3.33     D+       = 1.33
          B           = 3.00     D        = 1.00
          B-          = 2.67     D-       = 0.67
          C+          = 2.33     F        = 0.00
class attendance policy
Class attendance is a requirement and use of the full class period is expected.You will be allowed three sick, personal, physical or
mental health days without grading consequences. It is up to your discretion how you use these three days. Being late to class three
times or leaving class early three times will count as an absence. 15 minutes late to the start of class will constitute a tardy. Leaving
class before being dismissed by your professor will constitute an early departure. A 4th absence will result in the lowering of your
final grade by one letter grade. Absences, tardiness and/or early departures beyond this could result in course failure. If a serious
medical or personal situation occurs affecting attendance, please discuss it with your professor. No late work will be accepted. No
incompletes will be given. If you feel you will not be able to complete all work on time, you should ask the instructor for a grade of Q
or drop before the deadline for doing so passes.
Q drop Policy The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six (6). As stated
in Senate Bill 1231:“Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit an undergraduate
student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher
education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”


university attendance policy: religious holy days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious
holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give
you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
documented disability statement
Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact Services for Students with Dis-
abilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty are not required to provide accommodations
without an official accommodation letter from SSD.
