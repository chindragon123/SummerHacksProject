Description
This course builds on the material presented in Introduction to Macroeconomics
(ECO 304L). Major theoretical concepts, analysis tools, and empirical regularities
are explored in the context of issues facing the United States and other economies.
By the end of the course, students should be able to address three sets of questions.
(1) What determines the performance of an economy (e.g., its growth rate, its
unemployment rate)? (2) In what ways are macroeconomies being permanently
transformed in the 21st century? (3) How do particular macroeconomies interact
with, and deviate from, the general mechanisms of the global economy?
The prerequisite for this course is ECO 420K. If your transcript does not show
credit for ECO 420K, with a grade of “C minus” or better
                           you will be dropped from this course;
                       you are advised to adjust your schedule now
          (no economics courses may be added after the fourth class meeting).
Materials
        The required text is Macroeconomics, 2nd Edition, by Frederic Mishkin (Ó
2015). Additional course materials will be placed on Canvas.
Expectations
        Lectures consist primarily of extensions and applications of topics in the
Mishkin text. I will alert the class to common errors and easily overlooked
subtleties. Above all, the best use of our class time is for me to answer your
questions.

       To learn macroeconomics, you must take an active role. Your tasks are to
read the assigned chapters and identify concepts you find unclear, to test your
comprehension by thinking carefully about the exercises at the end of each chapter,
and to give me opportunities to help with the uncertainties you encounter. To
encourage active learning, there will be three in-class quizzes, which will serve as
diagnostic “pre-tests,” revealing to what extent you are prepared to perform well
on exams, and where you might need additional efforts and/or help.
       Please let me know immediately if you have any problem that is preventing
you from performing satisfactorily in this class. Any student with a documented
disability who requires academic accommodations should contact Services for
Students with Disabilities (SSD) at http://ddcetest.info/disability/contact-us/.
Exams and Grading
       There will be three mid-term exams and a comprehensive final exam (dates
are provided below). Final grades will be based on the three highest exam scores;
if you are satisfied with your scores on the mid-term exams, you need not take the
final exam.
       Weights used to calculate final grades
       quizzes                                       10%
       mid-term exams                                30% X 3, or 25% X 2
       final exam (optional)                         40%
       The “quizzes” score is based solely on your taking the quizzes. The score is
not affected by whether or not you get the right answers. Everyone begins the
course with an “A” for this 10%; the quizzes grade will decline only if you miss
any of the quizzes.
       The final exam score is included in the grade computation only if doing so
raises your grade. If so, the final exam is weighted 40%, and the two highest mid-
term scores are weighted 25% each.
       Exams are based on class lectures. Familiarity with Mishkin's coverage of
the material is required to understand the lectures and to perform well on exams.
Exam questions involve graphs, algebra, and economic logic (cause & effect).
Grades on each exam are curved up to a class average of 70%.
       Quizzes and exams will be returned in class. Thereafter, such documents
will be in my office for you to collect at your convenience (and are stored for

know your grade. I do not post grades nor discuss grades via phone or email.
Final course grades become available on line when and as the Registrar posts them.
