____________________________________________________________________________________________
This upper-division lecture course allows students to gain a deeper understanding of civil rights movements by placing
them in the context of US society from World War II to the 1970s. By the end of the semester, students will have
learned how to construct their own
arguments about this history about based on
the original documents.
The Black civil rights movement forms the
spine of the course, but it addresses related
struggles by Asian Americans, Native
Americans, and, especially, Latinos, and
devotes attention to matters of gender and
class, along with race. This year marks the
65th anniversary of passage of Brown v. Board
of Education, for example, but few know its
connection to cases involving Mexican
Americans. Nearly six decades after the
Montgomery Bus Boycott, why do most
people still associate Rosa Parks with being
too tired to give up her seat and Dr. King with
planning and leading the boycott? Closer to home, UT established Black and Mexican American studies departments in
2010 and 2014, but how many realize that 50 years ago, Black and Chicano students demanded the creation of such
departments?
IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE more complex perspectives than the well-known civil rights narrative, this course is
organized around the following critical vantage points. Be sure to take note as they arise in class or in readings.
Comparative. The Black Freedom Movement forms the backbone of the course, but we also examine movements
among Asian Americans, Native Americans and, especially, Mexican Americans.
Relational. We consider how social justice movements among these different groups intersected with and influenced
each other, rather than imagining them as isolated from one another.
Complex. This course concentrates not only on desegregation and voting rights campaigns, but subjects frequently left
out of historical civil rights narratives.
Historical Context. The course positions civil rights struggles alongside broader historical developments like the Cold
War, urbanization, economic transformation, and changes in mass media.
Local/National. Instead of concentrating solely on federal policy, national organizations, and famous leaders, we also
study local struggles and local people.
Race and Rights, Gender and Class. Throughout, we look not only at what people did, but the historical elaboration of
ideologies that branded people and concepts in powerful ways.
OVERALL COURSE STRUCTURE AND EVALUATION
We will cover lots of material in this course, but I don’t expect you to memorize every detail. Pay most attention to
key themes and the cases that best illustrate them. Students in the course have varying levels of historical knowledge
and writing skills, so improvement factors into my grading. To do well, ask for help when you need it, but also get
actively engaged in the course! You’ll have chances to share thoughts, raise questions, and work on small group
projects. We’ll also look at films and photos to “see” history differently.

CLASS POLICIES
NAMES AND GENDER IDENTITIES: If you prefer a name or pronoun not on the roster, let me know asap.
ATTENDANCE: To be clear, this course requires you in class with readings completed, and not coming in late or leaving
early. You are permitted 3 unexcused absences, but after that you lose 2 points for each additional one. Excused
absences cover documented medical and mental health problems, personal or family emergencies, official university
responsibilities, and religious holidays. At my discretion, multiple late arrivals and/or early departures may result in an
additional unexcused absence.
          SIGNING IN: Before class begins or after it ends, check in at the front of the room.
          IF YOU FORGET, you may bring in your notes to prove you were in class.
          If you miss over 2 consecutive class days, please discuss with me as soon as possible.
TECHNOLOGY IN THE CLASSROOM: No phones may be out in class and the sound should be turned off. You may use a
laptop to take notes, but you will lose that privilege if you use it for other activities during lectures. Really.
EXTRA CREDIT: You can raise your final grade by 1-2 points by attending 1 approved event and uploading to Canvas a
350-word (or longer) typed, double-spaced paper of 350 words or more about your strongest impressions. Plan to stay
for the entire event. I will announce events as they arise, but suggestions are welcome. EXTRA CREDIT PAPERS ARE
DUE WITHIN 1 WEEK OF THE EVENT.
MAKING UP WORK:
ASSIGNMENTS: You are responsible for all written assignments, even if you miss class the day they are due. For an
excused absence, submit them by the day after you return; for an unexcused absence, submit at the regular time. If
you are experiencing a longer-term problem and fall behind, please speak with me!
GROUP WORK: If you miss an in-class project, you will need to make it up another way. Talk to me …
EXAMS: Full credit for excused absences, a 10-point deduction for unexcused absences if the exam is taken on or


before the next history department make-up time. After that, a loss of 10 more points for each additional day. History
Department make-up exams occur every Friday, 2-4:45. Contact me to schedule.
SHORT ASSIGNMENTS FOR SUBMISSION GRADES are aimed at understanding complicated material, or exploring
materials that historians regularly work with. There are no “correct answers” (though there may be wrong ones).
ESSAY EXAMS take place after each unit, on Canvas. I will circulate the subject about a week in advance, and HOLD
OPTIONAL STUDY SESSIONS to discuss how to approach it. My exams involve real-life projects historians take on. The
actual prompt explaining exactly what you’ll be writing will appear on the exam. Exams have set lengths (75 minutes
actual class time + extra 15 minutes to map out your essay = 90 minutes or 1 ½ hours), and must be taken during the
regular class time.
There is a detailed rubric on Canvas, but this one shows how I weight different aspects. NO BLUE BOOKS.
ESSAY EXAM RUBRIC FOR EXAMS*
Develops historical argument throughout essay              25 pts
Uses varied evidence, according to prompt                  20 pts

Quality of Conclusion                                      5 pts
*Note: I’m not grading you on how good a writer you are, but how well you develop your own historical argument
based on “evidence” from the unit (i.e., readings, lectures, documents, films)
COLLABORATIVE WORK:
GROUP DISCUSSIONS: You’ll have the opportunity to discuss documents, readings, or a big question with your
colleagues. Come to class prepared, having completed reading assignments.
GRADED GROUP PROJECTS: You will be responsible for your own part of the projects, in collaboration with all group
members. I will give one grade to the whole group, but you will be evaluating each other’s participation, which could
affect an individual’s grade. All your names must appear on what you submit to me, for credit. It serves as a signature
stating that you have participated fully in your group’s project.
CANVAS WILL BE USED for announcements, assignment details, grading rubrics, readings, lecture outlines, extra credit
opportunities, tips on note-taking, exams, and writing, and more. Most material will be on PAGES. On the home page,
click on PAGES. Then, VIEW ALL PAGES. You can then choose the one you are looking for. WARNING: if you access
documents through FILES, you may not be finding the most recent version.
COMMUNICATION:
Email vs. Canvas: For a timely response, email me at lbgreen@austin.utexas.edu, not Canvas, even if I send a message
to the whole class. I check email a few times a day, but Canvas much less often.
Use a professional form of address in emails: Prof. Green, Dr. Green, or some equivalent. I’ve received too many
emails that begin with “HEY”!
I may not see emails sent outside of regular business hours until the next day.
WHEN TO COME TO OFFICE HOURS: You want to talk more about subjects in class or connections to today. You want
to discuss an upcoming assignment. You want to improve your grade. You need advice about note-taking, reading
effectively, or other such issue. You have concerns about the course and want to share them to improve the class. You
are facing difficulties outside class that are preventing regular attendance or your best performance. (You are never
required to give me details in the last case.) Or any other reason.
          Keep in mind if you talk to me about sexual assault or suicidal thoughts, I must inform a counselor.
          Also keep in mind for the future that I am not able to write letters of recommendation for students in a lecture


          class unless I get to know them through office hours.
LECTURE POWERPOINTS will be posted on Canvas after (not before) lectures. They outline the main points of the
lecture and major topics of discussion, and include photographs and other images.
SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS are provided, upon request, for qualified students. Contact Dean of Students office at
471-6259 or ssd@uts.cc.utexas.edu if you need accommodations but are not certified. Submit your letter about
approved accommodations early in the semester. Talk to me if you your letter is not available.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: The University of Texas adheres strictly to guidelines regarding academic integrity, including
cheating and plagiarism. These guidelines extend to all material found on the Internet, as well as to all print material.
Penalties for violations may include loss of credit for the course and a report to the Student Judicial Services. Please
familiarize yourself with the very informative links on this website:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php. NOTE: The History Department has tailored its guidelines
for history courses. https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/history/about/academic-integrity.php
FLAGS FOR THIS COURSE:
Cultural Diversity in the United States courses increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American
cultural experience. Your grade comes from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one
U.S. cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalization.
Ethics and Leadership courses are designed to equip you with skills for making ethical decisions in your adult and
professional life. Assignments involve historical situations involving conflicts over ethics in real-life situations.
LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT: This course may be used to fulfill three hours of the U.S. history component of the
university core curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by the Texas Higher Education
Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking skills, personal responsibility, and social responsibility.
CHECK OUT NOT EVEN PAST, the UT History Department’s renowned interactive website. It features columns by
professors and graduate students about their research, book reviews, film reviews, op-eds, and stories about archival,
visual, and aural documents that illuminate intriguing corners of the past.
