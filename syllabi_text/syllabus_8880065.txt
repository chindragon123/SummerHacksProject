COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course will introduce students to the anthropological study of Christianity where we will focus in particular on the
linguistic and semiotic forms of Christian practice: the ways in which Christian missionaries and Christian
communities participate in traditions of textual circulation in which people are reading, translating, studying, arguing
with, resisting, or praying from the Bible and other sacred Christian textual forms. More broadly, we will examine the
varied ways in which many seemingly secular modes of reading, talking, or thinking about signs and meaning have
strong roots in Christian and especially Protestant histories. We will look at the complex modes of global circulation
of Christianity, from colonial missionization to contemporary televangelism. We will read ethnographic monographs
and articles about communities in North America, Melanesia, West Africa, Southern Africa, and Europe. As an
Independent Inquiry course, students will conduct an ethnographic research project over the course of the semester
examining Christian modes of communication at a particular local site.
Students will learn about linguistic anthropological theories of communication and semiotics (the way signs have
meaning and are used), about the spread of Christianity under European colonialism, and about the influence of
Christian models of communication in contemporary secular U.S. contexts. Students will gain experience with
anthropological methods of research and analysis. Class participation is largely through discussion of assigned
reading materials. Student research will include an ethnographic assignment that will develop student skills of
participant observation of social groups, interviews, and ethnographic writing.
ASSIGNMENTS
READING: Prior to most class sessions you will need to read the articles or books that I have listed on the syllabus.
     For each reading assignment I will give you guiding questions to help prepare you for a productive in-class
     discussion. You do not need to turn in answers to these questions, but you do need to think through them as you
     do the reading.
QUIZZES: At eight points during the semester there will be a 10-minute in-class quiz for which you have to answer
     one of the reading questions from the previous session’s readings. You will always have a choice between two
     different questions. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped. [30]
PARTICIPATION AND ABSENCES: Come to class prepared to discuss the readings for the day and take notes on
     the discussion. In order to get full participation points, students need to participate – talk – regularly during class
     discussions. Going over the reading questions I provide will prepare you for discussion and for the quizzes. You


      can miss one class without penalty. Each absence beyond 1 results in a point taken off your participation grade.
      You lose the entire 10 points for participation if you miss five classes total. [10]
POST-FILM REFLECTIONS: We will watch 2 documentaries during the semester. A 1-page reflection on each film
      guided by a topic/question I provide is due 3 days after the screening (Oct 21, Nov 18, 5pm, Canvas). [10]
ETHNOGRAPPHIC RESEARCH PROJECT: At some point during the semester you need to attend 2-3 (related)
      events relevant in some way to the course and develop an ethnographic analysis of them. These could be
      church services, worship music concerts, Hell Houses, Quaker meetings, or meetings of atheist associations,
      among other possibilities. You will use the course readings to develop a research question about this site/these
      events. You will also need to interview 1-2 people who are connected to this event/site. All of the elements below
      are mandatory parts of the project.
      •   Sep 13 and Oct 16: In-class writing exercises to help you begin to write and think ethnographically. You will
          turn in the writing that you do in class. [10]
      •   Between Oct 9 and Oct 25: Meet with me in office hours to discuss which events to attend, which aspects of
          the event you will focus on, what questions you will bring to your analysis, and what makes the site/event
          interesting to you. Bring a one paragraph description of your proposed event, the questions you will ask
          about it, and potential connections to class readings. [5]
      •   Nov 27, Nov 29, Dec 4: End-of-semester class presentations. During the final sessions of the class we will
          have a chance to present to the class on their projects in a multi-media context. [15]
      •   Dec 13: Turn in final ethnographic papers. Roughly 12-15 pages. Papers will use written sources from class
          readings to help frame the research question/problem and provide a theoretical framework. Students will find
          their own background materials on the site/events to give basic social/historical context. The main portion of
          the paper will be an analysis of the events and interviews that you will have attended or conducted during
          the semester. You will come to a conclusion that responds to your research question with a generalization of
          some sort. You will also note what further research would be needed for a more in-depth analysis of this
          issue and provide a critical evaluation of the evidence that you gathered. More information on the final paper
          will be distributed later in the semester. [20]
INDEPENDENT INQUIRY FLAG
This course carries an Independent Inquiry flag. II courses are designed to help students develop their critical thinking
and research skills using different disciplinary research methods. Anthropology uses qualitative research methods to
try to understand the cultural knowledge and experiences people bring to everyday interactions. Anthropological
research methods include participant observation, interviewing, textual analysis, and spatial analysis, among others.
These methods – generally bundled together as ‘the ethnographic method’ – can be used in a number of different
professional contexts outside of anthropology where close examination of how groups of people are responding to an
event, problem, or object is a central issue (international development, market research, consulting, etc.). The
objectives for this course and your research project include:
      •   Students will identify a creative, focused, and manageable research question or topic for inquiry.
      •   Students will identify and synthesize existing knowledge and research relevant to their inquiry topic.
      •   Students will draw from one or more disciplinary perspectives to design a methodology for answering their
          research question or pursuing their inquiry.
      •   Students will gather, evaluate, synthesize, or create relevant evidence, knowledge, or other elements to
          reveal insights about their topic.
      •   Students will present a conclusion or creative work that logically follows from the inquiry findings.
      •   Students will critique their own inquiry process and the processes of others when possible, demonstrate that
          they understand the limitations of their conclusions or results, and identify directions for future inquiry.
COURSE MATERIALS
READINGS: Articles are available through Canvas, either as PDFs or links to journal websites. There is one book for
the course. It is available as an ebook through the library (link on Canvas) and is on reserve at PCL. The book is
available for purchase at many online stores for $15 or less.

For the quizzes, the film responses, the final project presentations, and the final papers, your writing (or your
presentation script) should demonstrate familiarity with the reading and course themes. Responses that not only
answer a quiz question or film prompt but provide further links to other readings, or to other questions, themes, or
issues in the course will receive the highest point values. Final project elements (presentation and paper) should
connect your own ethnographic material to thematic and theoretical issues discussed in class and in the readings,
demonstrating your understanding of key concepts and ability to use them in the analysis of novel ethnographic
material.
Example rubric for quizzes:
           Demonstrates excellent understanding of the reading and its relationship to the overall course themes and
           issues: A
           Demonstrates solid familiarity with the reading, answering the question satisfactorily: B/B+
           Slight familiarity with the reading, but one or more elements of the answer incorrect: C
           No familiarity with the reading demonstrated (or no assignment turned in): F
Late work & missed quizzes
Late work will be marked down 1/3 of a grade for each day late (e.g., from an A- to a B+). Sometimes things happen
that are out of your control. Once during the semester you can turn in something 2 days late or make up a missed
quiz.
Absences
You can miss one class without penalty. After that, 1 point will be taken off your 10-point attendance/participation
grade for each absence. If you miss 5 classes you lose all attendance/participation points. The only absences that will
be considered excused are for religious holidays or extenuating circumstances due to an emergency.
Names and Personal Pronoun Preference
I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name different than what appears on the roster, and by the
gender pronouns you use.
University Policies
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The
University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.”
Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you
have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to
academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic
Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:

Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline, which
typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in
college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:

University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn differently. If
there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as
possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. There are
also a range of resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are circumstances that
make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information that you need to share with me,
or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed
to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me
as early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact
Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone).

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual
assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT
Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When
sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
                1.   Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
                2.   Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
                     become involved in a Title IX investigation.
                3.   Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters,”
which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible
Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one.
Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether
they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without making an
                                                                7


    official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and
    resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
    The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security,
    512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
    Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire
    alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
•   Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest
    exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
•   Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
•   In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless
    given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or
    Fire Prevention Services office.
•   Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at:

    Guns
    Pursuant to SB11 (http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/pdf/SB00011F.pdf) and UT- Austin Campus Carry
    Policy (https://campuscarry.utexas.edu/; https://www.policies.utexas.edu/ policies/campus-concealed-carry), persons
    with a current legally valid Concealed Carry License may carry a concealed legal handgun on or about their person in
    this class. Please take note of several provisions:
    1. All legal provisions associated with concealed carry on campus must be followed without fail at all times. In
    addition to SB11 and UT-Austin Campus Carry policy, please review at least the 84 pages of applicable law curated
    by TX DPS (http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/InternetForms/Forms/CHL-16.pdf).
    Please take special note of two of the many legal provisions:
             a. Holstering requirements: “A license holder who carries a handgun on campus must carry it in a holster that
             completely covers the trigger and entire trigger guard area. The holster must have sufficient tension or grip on
             the handgun to retain it in the holster even when subjected to unexpected jostling” (UT-Austin HOP 8-1060,
             VII-A-2).
             b. “On or about your person means a person licensed to carry a handgun must carry a handgun in a manner
             that the handgun is close enough to the license holder that he or she can reach it without materially changing
             position” at all times (UT-Austin HOP 8-1060, IV).
    2. A license holder may not carry a partially or wholly visible handgun on campus premises or on any university
    driveway, street, sidewalk or walkway, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking area. (SB11, Section 4 and Texas
    Penal Code, Section 46.035(a-1)). Violation is a Class A misdemeanor or a third degree felony.
    If any legal requirement is violated at any moment, the person who witnesses the violation should leave the
    classroom and call 911 immediately without waiting to ask me for permission. Police will respond. This will disrupt the
    class and may create a dangerous situation for all of us. Violations may result in criminal penalties and sanction by
    the university.
                                                                   8
