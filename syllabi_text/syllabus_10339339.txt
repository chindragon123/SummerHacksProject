Text:            Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings, 13th Edition,
                 By Grondzik, Kwok, Wiley & Sons, New York, 2019
Objective
The intent of this course is to learn to integrate environmental control systems into the
form making process of architectural design. This course is intended to be one of a
series of building science courses which describe the function of building in filtering the
environment about their occupants.            Environmental Controls I considered the
fundamentals of Lighting, Electrical Systems and Acoustics. Environmental Controls II
considers the application of the thermal environment, the issues of water systems and
the application of the fire code as well as other technical problems encountered in
building design. We will focus on how the various human sensory systems are
supported by related building; mechanical, building and environmental controls sub-
systems.
In Environmental Controls II, application sections are divided into four parts: Fire
Protection; Vertical Transportation; Heating, Venting, and Air Conditioning; and
Plumbing. These sections will be organized in the following way:
        1. Required fire protection and fire exits.
        2. Review of elevator and escalator specifications.
        3. Sizing heating, venting and air conditioning systems.
        4. Servicing the water needs of plumbing.
Goals
The goal of this course is to develop a means by which designers can create energy-
efficient buildings. These means shall include both: (1) to understand the forms and
components of a building that provide efficiency and comfort; (2) processes for use in
design that will encourage the selection of the proper physical responses and facilitate
the investigation of the likely performance of these decisions. Successful completion of
this course should give the student the ability to:
        1. Determine building environmental controls needs for fostering comfort and
           performance requirements.
        2. To suggest building strategies to satisfy these needs.
        3. To synthesize building solutions and environmental control schemes that
           promote the design of efficient buildings.
        4. To analytically and physically evaluate the performance of their environmental
           control decisions.
