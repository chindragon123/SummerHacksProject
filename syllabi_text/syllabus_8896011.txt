Course Description and Objectives
The Black Power movement was a distinct period in African American life from the
late 1960s and early 1970s that emphasized racial pride, the creation of black
political and cultural institutions, self-reliance, and group unity. The expression of
black power ideology ranged from the desire to create an all-black nation-state to
the promotion of black economic power. This course will look at the major
organizations, key figures, and ideologies of the black power movement.
This course may be used to fulfill three hours of the U.S. history component of the
university core curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives
established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board: communication
skills, critical thinking skills, personal responsibility, and social responsibility.
