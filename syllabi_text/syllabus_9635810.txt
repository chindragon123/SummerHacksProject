Course Description
The course is designed as an overview of the field of social demography. It is designed to help
students understand the larger factors shaping population size, composition and density.
Through the semester, we will explore key concepts, theories and basic measurements that are
essential to study population dynamics. The topics that will be covered in the course are:
Mortality, morbidity, fertility, migration, urbanization, age and sex structures and the social
implications of demographic changes. Through this class students will also learn how to read
and interpret graphs, data and demographic phenomena.
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of the material and assignments to cover non-U.S. cultural groups, past or
present.
Course Goals
By the end of this course students will be able to identify trends in human populations,
compare causes and consequences of demographic changes and will be able to identify and
classify demographic anomalies by recognizing main demographic measurements. In addition,
students will be able to describe demographic trends by being able to read and interpret graphs
and data.

Homework assignments- The goal of these assignments is to improve the understating of class
material through the actual practice of methods, techniques, concepts and measurements
learned in class. Homework will be posted a week before its due date. Homework assignments
must be submitted by the end of the day it is due (11:59 PM).
Weekly quizzes- will be based on class lectures and readings. Each quiz will include:
          1) 2 multiple choice questions (10% each=20%)
          2) 4 short answer questions (20% each=80%)
Bonus assignments
Group projects- Up to 2 students can work together on the bonus assignments.
     • The first assignment will be a presentation proposal on an interesting demographic case
          study. This can be about a unique population, an interesting trend, a demographic
          anomaly or anything else that you find interesting (1-2 paragraphs).
     • For the second, students with the most persuasive proposals (not necessarily the best
          written ones) will be given the opportunity to present their case study in class (10
          minutes).
Pop quizzes (readings)-Each pop quiz will include 3 multiple choice questions on class readings.
The goal of these quizzes is to benefit those who read and prepare for class.
Data assignment- The goal of this assignment is to improve the student’s data skills. The
students are expected to clean, graph and analyze quantitative data.
                                                               2
