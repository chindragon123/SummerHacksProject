COURSE DESCRIPTION
This seminar style course critically explores the historical practice of deportation in the United
States both past and present, looking at how our ideas of human rights, freedom, and belonging
intersect with racial and national ideologies. We will study the social, cultural, and political
histories of banishment in the United States by working through a rich archive which includes:
critical theory, autobiographical accounts, feminist artwork, poems and protests written from the
cells of U.S. immigration enforcement, and even satire, drawing important connections between
the political geographies, experiences, and responses of Indigenous Americans, Black dissidents,
and Mexican deportees. This careful study of removal will help us to reflect on the contemporary
moment of global mass migrations at a time when humans are increasingly managed through
preventative policing, detention, and deportation, and finally, we will reflect on the creation of
“un-deportable” subjects, the people who still remain detained in U.S. military facilities in
Guantánamo Bay.

CLASSROOM CONDUCT, POLICIES, AND LOGISTICS
Course Website: Please visit Canvas frequently to access weekly readings, important course
materials and course instructions.
Office Hours: Make use of office hours early on in the semester. You can come one-on-one, in
pairs or small groups. If you need to book a time outside of normal office hours, please send an e-
mail to me.
                                                                                                     2


Email: Please reduce e-mail traffic and do not rely on e-mail for last minute questions. There is
always time reserved at the end of the seminar to address questions or clarifications that are of
general interest to the entire class. More specific questions and issues should be addressed during
office hours.
Electronics Policy: Unless you make arrangements with SSD, please refrain from using laptops
during the seminar. You are expected to contribute to a classroom atmosphere that is productive
and cordial. Turn off cell phones before class, do not hold private conversations during class, and
use your common sense to avoid conduct that might distract other students. I address
controversial topics in this course, and it is imperative that we treat each other with respect.
Lectures: I do not post or distribute lecture slides or notes and I only share these during the
designated classroom instruction time. For reasons of fairness and consistency, I adhere to this
policy. If you miss class you should borrow notes from a classmate. If I need to cancel a lecture
for any reason, whether personal illness or hazardous weather, I will notify you via Canvas as
soon as possible.
Late Work: Deadlines are firm. Late assignments will drop a letter grade for the first day they
are late and a one-third letter grade for each additional day that they are late. A perfect
assignment turned in one day late would receive a B+, and two days after the deadline it would
receive a B. Extensions are granted only with advanced notice and usually only in cases of
documented illness or emergency.
Grades:
A = 94-100 / A- = 90-93 / B+ = 87-89 / B = 84-86 / B- = 80-83 / C+ = 77-79 / C = 74-76 / C- =
70-73 / D+ =67-69 / D = 64-66 / D-= 60-63 / F= 59 and below. Final course grade averages .5
and above will be rounded up. Thus a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 79.5 through 83.4. The
University does not recognize the grade of A+.
Recordings: Students are not permitted to record any portion of the lecture unless prior
permission has been granted.

          entering the building.
     • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing
          during the first week of class.
     • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
          Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
          Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire
          Prevention Services office.
