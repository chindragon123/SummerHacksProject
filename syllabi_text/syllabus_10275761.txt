"This course may be used to fulfill three hours of the U.S. history component of the university core
curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by the Texas Higher Education
Coordinating Board: communication skills critical thinking skills, personal responsibility, and social
responsibility." Also, see page 11 for Independent Inquiry and Writing flags information.
COURSE DESCRIPTION
Within the construct of African American Business history, race, American capitalism, contemporary American popular
culture and global capitalism, this course will focus on an important aspect in the contemporary political economy of
black Americans. Specifically, the commodification (sale) of black culture provides the conceptual frame for an
examination of the phenomenon of both the superstar black athlete as an entrepreneur and the Hip Hop Superstar as
an entrepreneur in post-Civil Rights America. The emphasis in this course, then, is to critically examine and analyze
the impact of a multiplicity of societal, cultural and economic factors in the post-modern information age, propelled by
new technologies in the New Economy of Global Capitalism. Also, consideration will be given to the new diversity as
it impacts on the political economy of African Americans and American capitalism.
Yet, during the “Golden Age” of black business in the early 20th century, there were examples of African Americans
participating in the development of enterprises that paralleled mainstream white business activity in Industrial America
such as the first African American car manufacturing company, C.R. Patterson & Sons. The Ohio-based company was
founded by ex-slave in 1865 and manufactured carriages. In 1916, the founder’s son Frederick Douglass Patterson,
built his first car, the Patterson-Greenfield below...
                                                             1


Early advertisements showed the Patterson Car company’s marketing brand announced: “If it’s a Patterson, it’s a good
one.” Also the company said their cars be more efficient than the Model T. The cars cost about $850 each while a
Model T cost $620.and reached speeds up to 50 miles per hour, while a Model T cost $620 and averaged 20 miles
per hour. The Patterson Company could not compete with Ford’s assembly-line production and eventually stopped
production of the Patterson-Greenfield car. In the 1920s, the Patterson Company became a subcontractor
manufacturing busses for Ford.
See Juliet E. K. Walker, The History of Black Business in America: Capitalism, Race, Entrepreneurship ((New York/London:
Macmillan/Prentice Hall International, 1998; 2nd Printing, Macmillan, 1999), 203, 239. 262
By the 1930s, most black business sales were limited to black consumers. In the Civil Rights era, black hair care
manufacturers expanded into million dollar enterprises. Beginning with the post-Civil Rights and Black Power eras, the
only black businesses that profited from multi-million dollars sales in American’s mainstream consumer market were
those enterprises that commodified (sold) black cultural expressions, primarily in music, sports and cable TV media
enterprises. Ironically, with few exceptions most of the profits derived from the sale of black culture go to white corporate
America.
PURPOSE OF COURSE
Proceeding from an interdisciplinary perspective, the course considers the super-rich hip hop entrepreneurs, superstar
black athletes and the cable media billionaire moguls well as their emergence as cultural icons, contrasted with the
comparatively overall poor performance of Black Business not only within the intersection of race, gender, class, but
also within the context of transnationalism in the globalization sale of African American Culture in post-Civil Rights
America. But who profits? Indeed, also, why and how has the criminal element in the black community used modern
business methods to succeed such as exemplified by the movie “American Gangster,“ which starred Denzel
Washington.
Most important, the major question is why business receipts for African Americans, who comprise almost thirteen
percent of this nation's population, amounted in 2007 to only .5%, that is, less than one (1) percent of the nation's total
business receipts? In addition, why is it that among the various occupational categories in which blacks participate in
the nation's economy, especially as businesspeople that black entertainers and sports figures are the highest paid?
What does this say about race, class, gender and hegemonic masculinities in America at the turn of the new century?
Within the context of superstar black athlete as entrepreneurs, class discussion and student research papers will
explore the business activities of superstar black athletes, such as Magic Johnson, contrasted, as an example, with
that of the business activities of a Michael Jordan. Also, the course will consider the rise of superstar black athlete
entrepreneurs as an expansion of African American business activities within the context of the expansion of global
capitalism. Are there factors beyond race that explain the economic success of a Don King or George Foreman, Mike
Tyson, and Muhammad Ali, as contrasted with their predecessors such as Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson in the
world of boxing? Does the expansion of global capitalism transcend race when considering the economic success of
Tiger Woods and the Williams sisters? Does the increasing success of superstar Black athletes suggest a “declining
significance of race” or has the expansion of global capitalism superseded race? Also, for consideration, if Blacks
gained control of all aspects of a Sports Industry, basketball and football, as examples, would there be a decline in
white consumer support of these industries? In addition, what factors contribute to the limitations of Black Athletes in
the Sports Industry beyond the playing fields such as sports wearing apparel manufacturing, team ownership, as well
as top management positions in various aspects of the sports industry? Is there a glass ceiling for Black women in the
                                                                       2


Sports Industry or does gender limit the degree of success for all women in the Sports Industry? Particularly, the
course will consider student interpretation of the impact of the forces of race, class and the commodification of black
cultural expressions as factors, e.g., the phenomenal athletic abilities of these Black athletes, that have contributed to
their successes on the playing fields, courts, links, tracks,
Within the context of Hip Hop entrepreneurship, foremost, what are the enterprises that have been generated by
the Hip Hop Industry? Who are moguls, the entrepreneurs, in the Hip Hop Industry whose business activities reflect
risk-taking and innovation? Can these entrepreneurs be viewed within the tradition of the Schumpeterian tradition of
creative capitalist, where entrepreneurial motivation extends beyond the desire for the accumulation of profits, but
rather is motivated by non-economic forces: “the will to conquer, the impulse to fight, to prove oneself superior to
others, to succeed for the sake, not of the fruits of success but of success itself.” What market factors precipitated the
growth of the Hip Hop Industry? What historic factors in post-Civil Rights America precipitated the growth of the Hip
Hop Industry? What are the economic implications for Black America as a result of the Hip Hop Industry? In what
ways, economically, has Black America profited or not profited from the Hip Hop Industry?
Within the scope of the post-Civil Rights era history of black business, has the commodification of black culture
been the most profitable avenue to wealth for black entrepreneurs? Why? Also, how do the profits in the Hip Hop
Industry compare with profits in other American industries, as well as those industries that distinguish the expansion of
in global capitalism? Why has the commodification of black culture been the most viable business activity for blacks in
the mainstream of American business life? In the overall economic life of Black America, who profits from Hip Hop?
And, how do they profit, financially? Or, has the Hip Hop culture marked a turning point whereby black labor and black
culture are now benefiting the progenitors? Then, too, in what ways and in what financial amounts or financial benefits
have hip hop profits trickled down to the black community?
Within comparative context of People of Color and White Corporate American Entrepreneurship,
From slavery to freedom, the economic value of the labor of African Americans has benefited White America. Does it
continue to do so? Or, has the Hip Hop culture marked a turning point whereby black labor and black culture are now
benefiting the progenitors? Or, do we find that the in the instance of Hip Hop, i.e., the commodification of black culture
continues to benefit White America? In the overall economic life of Black America, who profits from Hip Hop? Who
profits from the labor of superstar sports athletes? And, how do they profit, financially? Finally, who provides a model
for the economic advancement of African Americans in the 21st century? Bob Johnson, Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry,
Dave Bing, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Russell Simmons, Fifty Cent, Diddy-Sean Combs, Beyoncé’, J-Zay, Tiger
Woods, the Williams Sisters? Or, Nigerian-born Houston-based Kase Lawal, the second African American with
business receipts of more than $1 billion. Then, more recently, the Austin, Texas based Robert F. Smith, CEO and
founder of private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, who with net worth of $2.5 billion, ranked No. 268
on Forbes' list of wealthiest Americans, joining Oprah Winfrey and Michael Jordan in being the only three
African American billionaires. .
Why not more Black American entrepreneurs, such as Reginald Lewis, the first black American entrepreneur with
sales above $1 billion? Also, there are black-owned companies such as World Wide Technology Inc., St. Louis-
based IT products and services (branch in Austin), $5 billion sales in 2012; CAMAC International Corp., a Houston-
based crude oil, gas exploration, and production and trading company, $1.6 billion sales, established by a Nigerian
immigrant, Kasen Lawal ; or Bridgewater Interiors L.L.C. Detroit-based Automotive parts supplier, revenues, $1,186,
billion? Why not an African American Bill Gates, Michael Dell, Ray Kroc, Sam Walton, Warren Buffett or Steve Jobs
                                                              3


Apple founder, Amazon's chief Jeff Bezos and a Mark Elliot Zuckerberg and/or Facebook co-founder or
Google’s cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin? Why not an African American Jerry Yang, Vinod Khosla?
Then, too, who are their American counterparts among other people of color: Africans, Latinos, Asians (Japanese,
Koreans, Chinese) and those people of color globally who participate in the mainstream global capitalist economy?
Who are their American counterparts among white people, including Middle Eastern and South Asian peoples.
And, how does Black American Entrepreneurship compare with White American Entrepreneurship, also within the
context of American and Global Capitalism?

Mid-Term Take-Home Exam 30%
The exam will be based on your assessment of the history of black business from Reconstruction
to the 21st century. The independent economic self-help business activities of African Americans
are usually ignored in both black and white content history books. WHY? Most important,
considering the abysmal state of African American business, your exam should proceed from the
perspective of Carter G. Woodson’s statement that: “Those who fail to understand the past live to repeat
if.” The point is: would knowledge that African Americans have a virtual four century participation
in the nation’s business encourage more black business participation?

1. brief overview/summary of the book
2. your assessment of the significance of the book’s content as it relates to race, black business and the

Whatever the topic of your research paper, it must include field research, that is, you must identify and interview
someone in that business field so you can get a realistic appraisal/perspective. For example, if you wanted to write
about business success of Beyonce—perhaps you could interview her mother, a co-partner in House of Dereon fashion
line in Houston. The point is select a topic that will allow you to get some kind of first-hand knowledge of black
participation in that business area. Then, there is Houston-based George Foreman involved in several entrepreneurial
activities. What this means is that the documentation for your research paper must include three kinds of
sources: primary, secondary and oral sources
Students are required to see me during my office hours during both the conceptualization and writing phases of your

As Frederick Douglass said in 1857:
“If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and deprecate
agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without
thunder and lightning. ….
  People might not get all they work for in this world, but they must certainly work for all they get."

 The course is designed so that each student will get an A grade, but only if one attends all classes (university regulations
 state a student who is absent more than three times must fail the course) and, studies diligently and consistently.
 And, of course, A students are those who earn average A grades on all assignments.

 To implement this policy and reinforce building evacuation procedures, each faculty member shall provide the following information and
 instructions to students:
 Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm
 activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you
 may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
 Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation,
 follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
 Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
                                                                           11

Background on Campus Carry Laws in Texas
In 2015, the Texas Legislature approved the "campus carry" law, Senate Bill 11. The law provides that License to
Carry (LTC) permit holders may carry a concealed handgun throughout university campuses, starting Aug. 1, 2016.
The law gives public universities some discretion to regulate campus carry.
                                                           12


The University of Texas at Austin and President Gregory L. Fenves take issues surrounding guns on campus very
seriously and have worked to create policies that conform to the new law, protect the rights of citizens and ensure
the safety and security of the entire campus.
S.B. 11 provides that, after consulting with students, staffers and faculty members about "the nature of the student
population, specific safety considerations and the uniqueness of the campus environment," the university may enact
reasonable rules and regulations regarding the carrying of concealed handguns by license holders on campus.
The law stipulates, however, that these rules and regulations may not either "generally prohibit" or "have the effect
of generally prohibiting" license holders from carrying concealed handguns on campus.
Classroom
         Can I ban the carry of concealed handguns in my classroom?
         No. Faculty members cannot ban the concealed carry of handguns in their classrooms. Excluding handguns
         from classrooms would have had the effect of generally prohibiting student license holders from carrying
         their handguns, and thus would violate S.B. 11. Language in the law specifically forbids any policies that
         would generally prohibit campus carry or have the effect of generally prohibiting campus carry. That is
         why the concealed carry of handguns in classrooms is allowed.
General Information
         What do I do if I see a handgun in my classroom or on campus? If you see a gun, call 911.
         Campus carry requires that handguns remain concealed at all times with no exceptions, and if a handgun is
         visible, however briefly, it may be a violation of university policy and law. Notify law enforcement via 911
         and UTPD will arrive and assess the situation. Persons who violate these laws and policies are subject to
         penalties and fines in addition to disciplinary action imposed by the university.
         If your class is in a location where you cell phone does not get reception, identify the nearest location you
         can make a call at the beginning of the semester so you know where to go, if needed. If you have a TA or
         AI, have them leave and find the best place to call 911.
         Do faculty have a right to know if students are carrying a gun in class?
         No. Even if a faculty member were to ask, the LTC holder is not required to respond. Under Texas law,
         only law enforcement can verify whether a LTC holder is carrying and has a license to carry.

Research is at the core of our discipline and a key skill for History majors. Our undergraduates
engage in research in many forms from lower division courses through to graduation. Students
are able to gather evidence from a wide range of online databases, materials in campus libraries
and the extraordinary collection of original materials from all time periods and regions held in
                                                            13


our campus research centers like the Harry Ransom Center, the Briscoe Center for American
History, the Benson Latin American Collection and the LBJ Presidential Library. Read about
some of the many ways in which our undergraduates engage in research as a fundamental
element of the training in our major.
As part of their work in Prof. Juliet E. K. Walker’s HIS350 seminar, "History of Black Entrepreneurship in
the United States,” students develop content for the Undergraduate Journal of Black Business History.
The journal is an interdisciplinary forum for undergraduate students to share work on black
entrepreneurship, published under the auspices of the UT Austin Center for Black Business History,
Entrepreneurship and Technology, founded and directed by Prof. Walker, who notes it is a form of
entrepreneurship in its own right, offering students a rare opportunity to produce and publish their own
work while expanding the literature on black business history. POSSIBLY YOUR A PAPER WITH
ADDITONAL EDITING CAN BE PUBLISHED IN THE BELOW JOURNAL
