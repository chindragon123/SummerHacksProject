Catalog Description An applied course focused on the technical aspects of game content creation.
Prerequisite(s)     Game Art Pipeline or demonstrable experience working with game assets.
Course materials    A computer capable of running Unity and Unreal engine. A 3 button mouse.
Objectives &        This course challenges students to find solutions to common technical problems which occur during
Assessment          game development. A role playing format will be used to simulate studio conditions. The instructor will
                    play the part of Technical Lead and the students will serve as Technical Artists. Assignments in the form
                    of technical challenges will be revealed throughout the semester. Students will research options, devise
                    solutions and present their work using industry standards. In general, students will work individually,
                    though small teams may be formed for some assignments.

                    By the end of the course, students should be able to:
                    1) Prototype simple interactions.
                    2) Create custom shaders.
                    3) Automate asset creation and modification.
                    4) Determine in-game content budgets and optimize performance.
                    5) Troubleshoot rendering problems and recommend best practices.
                    6) Port assets between different engines.
Grading             This course is project based. There will be no exams. Assignments are equally weighted toward 90% of
                    the final class grade. The remaining 10% of the final grade is based on professionalism (see
                    Professionalism below).
                    No late work will be accepted. No incompletes will be given. If you feel you will not be able to complete
                    all work on time, you should ask the instructor for a grade of Q or drop before the deadline for doing so
                    passes.
                    Grading breakdown:
                    Each assignment will be graded according the following rubric:
                    Clarity of solution: 40 points      Quality of solution: 40 points       Quality of presentation: 20 points
                    Final grades will be determined using the following grade distribution. Please note: to ensure fairness,
                    all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will be inclusive of
                    all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not recognize the grade of A+.
                       A = 94-100           B+ = 87-89            C+ = 77-79            D+ = 67-69          F = 0-60
                       A- = 90-93           B = 84-86             C = 74-76             D = 64-66
                                            B- = 80-83            C- = 70-73            D- = 60-63
Professionalism     Professionalism is expected of all students and includes attending class during scheduled meeting times,
                    communicating clearly, respecting peers, and taking the class seriously. ​Rolling into class 15 minutes
                    late with a starbucks...while texting...on a skateboard...with earbuds blasting Kpop is NOT professional
                    conduct​. However, if you catch the flu, get a flat tire, or otherwise cannot attend class, please contact


                       BOTH the instructor and TA, and attach any class work as needed. Please note 3 unexcused absences
                       will lower your course grade by one letter.
UT Electronic Mail     Electronic mail (e-mail) is a mechanism for official University and instructor communication to students.
Notification Policy    Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with
                       University- and course-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be
                       time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week.
                       It is the responsibility of every student to keep the University and instructor informed of changes in his
                       or her official e-mail address (do so at https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/bio/address_change.WBX).
                       Consequently, e-mail returned to the University with "User Unknown" is not an acceptable excuse for
                       missed communication. Similarly, undeliverable messages returned because of a full inbox or use of a
                       spam filter will be considered delivered without further action required of the University or instructor.
                       (see ​http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy​)
Use of Class Materials The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, and homework
                       assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the class materials is a
                       violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.
                       Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may
                       be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could
                       result in further disciplinary action. This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to
                       websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students.
                       (from ​https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/coursematerials/Sample+Use+Statement+for+Syllabus​)
Religious Holidays     Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code states that a student shall be excused from attending
                       classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day,
                       including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be
                       penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment
                       from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy
                       requires students to notify each of their instructors at least fourteen days prior to the date they will be
                       absent from scheduled classes to observe a religious holy day.
                       (from ​http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/1555_001.pdf​)
Classroom Etiquette    Please observe the following rules during class as a courtesy to fellow students and the instructor.
                       1) ​Be on time at the beginning of class. ​If you must come in late at the beginning of class, please enter
                       the room and seat yourself as quietly and unobtrusively as possible.
                       2) ​Turn off your cell phone’s notification sounds upon entering the classroom​. If you forget to do so, and
                       your phone rings, chirps, or vibrates loudly during class, turn it off immediately and discreetly.
                       3)​ Food is not allowed in class. Drinks in closed containers are permitted but must be kept on the floor or
                       out of sight when not in use.
Academic               The University's ​Honor Code​ states that “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide
Integrity              by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” You are expected to maintain
                       absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in scholastic work undertaken at the
                       University. At a minimum, you should complete any assignments, exams, and other scholastic
                       endeavors with the utmost honesty, which requires you to:
                       ● acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts;
                       ● complete your assignments independently unless expressly authorized to seek or obtain assistance in
                           preparing them;
                       ● follow instructions for assignments and exams, and observe the standards of your academic
                           discipline; and
                       ● avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another student.
                       (adapted from ​http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php​)
Academic Dishonesty In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines academic dishonesty
                        as including ​any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved academic advantage​, such as:
                       ● Cheating
                       ● Plagiarism
                       ● Unauthorized Collaboration / Collusion
                       ● Falsifying Academic Records
                       ● Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain an extended
                           deadline for an assignment, or even gain an unearned financial benefit)
                       ● M​ultiple submissions​ (submitting the same assignment for two courses without authorization)
                       ● Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity
                       (adapted from ​http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php​)


                        Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
                         including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
                        (from ​http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_faculty_syllabus.php​)
Plagiarism              “Plagiarism” includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining
                         by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source, including words, ideas,
                         illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting that material as
                         one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program course requirement
                         (from Sec. 11-402,
                         http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-conduct​).
Copyright and           Understanding the basic principles of copyright and fair use is of critical importance to designers. Many
Fair Use                of the uses we will make of texts, images, and videos this semester will be covered by the doctrine of
                        fair use. However, as creators, you need to be aware of your own and other copyright holders’ legal
                        rights, and to properly identify and license your own and others’ works. We will discuss these issues
                        during the semester as needed, but when you have questions about whether or when you can
                        appropriate someone else’s work, a useful resource is Georgia K. Harper’s Copyright Crash Course,

Campus Carry            As permitted by Texas state law, the concealed carry of handguns by permit holders is generally allowed
                        in outdoor areas, as well as buildings and spaces that are accessible to the public. Permit holders are
                        allowed to carry in classrooms. It is the responsibility of concealed-carry license holders to carry their
                        handguns on or about their person at all times while on campus. “About” the person means that a
                        license holder may carry a holstered handgun in a backpack or handbag, but the backpack or handbag
                        must be close enough that the license holder can grasp it without materially changing position. The
                        holster must completely cover the trigger area and have enough tension to keep the gun in place if
                        jostled. A license holder may not carry a partially or wholly visible handgun on campus premises or on
                        any university driveway, street, sidewalk or walkway, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking area.
                        The open carry of handguns is not permitted on campus. Anyone who sees an openly carried gun on
                        campus should immediately call 911. (from ​https://campuscarry.utexas.edu/students​)
