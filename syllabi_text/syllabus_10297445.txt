INTRODUCTION
This course introduces students to the historical, theoretical, and social question of liberation in
the African diaspora from the period of slavery up to the current era. As such, we will take up
three major themes: slavery, marronage, and freedom; Pan-Africanism and anticolonialism;
Black Power and national liberation. We will examine how African peoples conceptualized
freedom and liberation in these periods, the major organizations and intellectuals who framed
them, and how popular activity developed and informed all three (ideas, organizations, and
intellectuals). Some of the questions we will take up include: how did enslaved Africans
conceptualize freedom? Did their ideas and activities merely extend western notions of liberty
and freedom, or develop distinct conceptions of freedom, rights, and humanity? Why in the early
Twentieth Century did African peoples around the world, who had little interactions with one
another, pursue pan-Africanism as a political philosophy? What limitations have class,
nationality, gender, and sexuality posed to such movements? Did national liberation struggles
from the 1950s through the 1970s in Africa and the Caribbean bring about fundamental changes
to those societies, or merely replicate colonialism’s oppressive regimes? What connections existed
between national liberation movements in Africa and the Caribbean, and Civil Rights and Black
Power in the United States and England? How does #BlackLivesMatter fit within this history?
Alongside these concerns, we will consider what constitutes a diaspora, and what makes Africans
and peoples of African descent around the world an African diaspora. Is the African diaspora a
racial or geographical designation? Are those people of African descent in the Caribbean and
Latin America who identify as something other than “black” part of the African diaspora? What
role does national location and citizenship play in how we think about the diaspora? How has the
migration/movement of peoples across regional and national boundaries contributed to a sense
of diasporic belongings?
LEARNING GOALS
While this course covers several key themes, it still has a loose chronological structure which
students are expected to learn. Rather than rote memorization, students will gain a sense of the
historical processes of change over time, and a broad methodology for assessing how events and
experiences influence the choices people make, what they believe is possible, and how these
inform human activity today. There are two broad learning goals in this course.
1) Conceptually, we examine different approaches to understanding and analyzing:
        — how individuals and groups are shaped by the past and shape the contemporary world
        — how people interact with and change society and social institutions
        — the role of large-scale political, economic, and ideological forces in human history
                                                   1


         — whether black people’s experiences in one location explains diasporic histories
         elsewhere
2) Practically, students will develop and/or sharpen skills essential to their academic and
professional growth. These include:
         — how to read and engage a variety of sources, documents, and literatures (newspaper
         accounts, memoirs, novels, scholarly works)
         — develop arguments based on analyzing such source materials
         — write in a way that effectively communicates your ideas
ATTENDANCE
To this end, students are expected to complete the assigned readings and arrive to class prepared
to engage lectures and to participate in discussions. Because attendance is essential, your
“Participation” grade also involves your presence in class. On your fourth absence, your
“Participation” grade automatically become an “F”, effectively lowering your overall grade by
one full letter.
CLASSROOM POLICIES
Laptops are not permitted for any reason in this course, unless there are legitimate, documented
reasons why one would need a laptop to take notes. Cell phones are not permitted. If you are
found using a cell phone for any reason, you will be asked to leave the class. Academic Integrity
Students are advised to familiarize themselves with the University of Texas’ policies on academic

plagiarism in this course will result in an automatic “F” for the assignment; the final disposition of
a penalty will follow the University’s guidelines. Please follow the links below for more

FLAGS: GLOBAL CULTURES
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and
histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.

    Your grade will be determined based of this scale. For example, if you receive a “B” on the Essay
    Assignment, the corresponding numerical score would be 85. As 20% of your grade, this will
    translate into (85 x .20=) 17. Adding all your grades will give you a final that corresponds to a
    letter grade (83 translates into a B-). An “F” grade ranges in value between 35-0; the failure to
    submit an assignment will result in “0” points.
