                       PLEASE READ THIS SYLLABUS CAREFULLY,
                           AS IT IS YOUR CONTRACT WITH ME.
General Info
       Regardless of your major, art history can be a valuable component of your studies at UT,
exposing you to the ways other human beings throughout time have interacted with, and
responded to, the world around them. Our course especially focuses on how art and visual
culture can help us connect to people outside of our culture(s) and time periods. Be aware
that we likely will discuss some potentially controversial subjects, including politics,
spirituality, sexuality, gender, etc.
       There is no assigned textbook for this course. For most lectures, you will access Canvas
to read a textbook chapter, excerpts from Khan Academy, or news articles. Please read the
assigned pages before the associated lecture so that you have an appropriate introduction to
the cultures that we discuss.
       Lectures are an important component of this course, as I will present material and
information that is not widely published. As I will reiterate in class: the readings provide the
data, and the lectures will provide interpretation. If you do not attend lecture consistently, you
will not do well in this course.
       Descriptions of the assignments, study materials, and major grades will be posted on
Canvas. You are responsible for keeping track of your own attendance, checking Canvas for
announcements and grades, and reporting any errors to the instructor. Any grading issues
need to be resolved by the last day of class, December 5th.
       This course carries the VAPA flag. VAPA (Visual Arts and Performing Arts) courses
provide introductions to the study and discussion of visual arts of all kinds, including
architecture, paintings, video, and dance. You will be expected to become familiar with the
visual qualities of art produced in a variety of time periods and geographic regions, and to
discuss not only the facts of their production (when/where) but also their messages.
       This class also carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices,
beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.

Classroom conduct
   • This is a no-laptops and no-cellphone classroom. If you need a laptop to take notes,
      please alert me via email or in person.
   • I reserve the right to ask you to leave if you disrupt the rest of the class’s ability to
      learn.
   • You should feel free to interpret ideas and express your thoughts without feeling
      embarrassed or fearing retribution. Please be open to listening to others’ views and
      compose your comments/questions in the most respectful language possible.
   • Audio recording lectures for personal use is allowed! But large-scale distribution (i.e.
      posting on Youtube, sharing via Dropbox folders, etc.) and monetization of recorded
      lectures violates copyright law. In addition, refrain from selling your notes of my
      lectures. Share them for free!
Communication and Email Policy
   • Please be aware that it may take up to 24 hours for me to return emails, and I only
      answer emails that use respectful language. Treat this class as you would a job.
   • Check that your email address is up-to-date in Canvas. You are responsible for checking
      your email regularly. You can find instructions for updating your e-mail address at:
         o http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php
Student and Professor Responsibilities
   • I am available to meet during office hours (see first page) and by appointment should
      you have a scheduling conflict with that time.
   • I have listed the assignments and exams for this course below so that you have an idea
      of when certain assignments are due.
   • You are responsible for tracking your absences and finding notes for any missed
      classes.
   • You are responsible for tracking your grades, which will be available on the
      assignments I grade online or hand back to you in person.
   • Your success in this course will be proportional to your “ownership” of the material.
      That entails not only studying the class material, but also asking questions for
      clarification if you have a problem understanding something.

*Attendance Policy
   • There will be an attendance sheet to sign for each lecture. It is your responsibility to
     sign the sheet upon arrival.
   • I take up the attendance sheet within 10 minutes of class starting. If you arrive after I
     collect the sign-in sheet, you may be counted as absent.
   • You automatically have four excused absences from class, with no need to email me or
     send me notes of any sort. If you miss more than four classes, I will deduct two points
     from your final grade for each additional absence.
   • Why is attendance important? Exams will be based on lectures and class discussions
     and writing assignments will be explained during class time.
Exceptions to Late Attendance/Assignment Policy:
   • Religious holidays: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at
     least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. You will be
     given an opportunity to complete missed work.
   • Department of Intercollegiate Athletics travel days are approved and do not take up
     your excused absences. HOWEVER, you must still inform me of your impending
     absences through the proper paperwork. You are still responsible for any assignments
     due. If travel days fall on any quizzes or tests in the course calendar of this syllabus,
     please notify me so arrangements can be made in advance.
   • If you have an illness, injury, personal or family emergency, your absence can be
     excused with notification from the Student Emergency Services in the Office of the Dean
     of Students:
