The Global Flag:
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and
histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
The Writing Flag:
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly
during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your
instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or
more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag
classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication,
Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating
Board.
Course Description
This lecture course offers both a broad overview and a chronological series of in-depth and
contextualized studies in the history of major garden cultures and designed landscapes of the
Western and Eastern worlds. In asking 'What is a garden or a designed landscape?' in each of
several specific historical cultures and societies, we witness the formation of certain forms
(morphologies) and typologies (repeated types) that were foundational for the whole subsequent


Prof. Mirka Beneš         UTexas School of Architecture: LAR 388K           Fall 2019 p. 2
history of landscape architecture. The course introduces the student to methodological approaches
to the formal, social, and cultural history of gardens and landscapes, as well as to relevant
theoretical frameworks for interpreting these designs and for conceptualizing landscapes,
architecture, and urban projects in studio design. Above all, it offers students a concept and an
experience useful for the design process: rehearsing the synthetic act of design by studying
historical examples helps the student think through the synthetic process of her or his own
designs.
The course is intended for and open to graduate and upper-level undergraduate students,
including MLA, M.Arch, B.Arch., Urban Studies, B.A., B.S., and M.A., Ph.D. students, etc.
Unique course numbers are created for each category of student. There are no prerequisites for
this course.
We cover key examples of design in landscape architecture across the large arc of time from
Mediterranean and Roman antiquity to about 1700 in England, when industrialization and
modernization in the West first affected urban and rural cultures. Our study thus witnesses the
gradual emergence by 1700 of key categories of modernity and a new notion of the public and of
public landscapes, as opposed to private ownership.
The societies and cultures covered in the course fall within three broad groupings:
1.) ancient Italy and Rome, where certain key typologies and forms were developed that became
          foundations for later gardens, both Western and Islamic.
2.) European and Islamic nations during the medieval and early modern periods (700 AD to ca.
          1700), e.g. states in Italy, France, England, as well as Islamic Spain, Ottoman Turkey,
          Safavid Persia, Mughal India, all cultures in which one finds parallel developments of
          formal gardens.
3.) England, 1600-1700, where a new conception of landscape design was born, the pastoralist
          "landscape garden," the source of so many important design traditions in the European
          and Anglo-American worlds, and still current today as a significant design language.
Although full coverage of the great traditions of garden design would include much more on
China and Japan, these cultures are incorporated into the course on a rotating basis, as the
instructor gains knowlege of them and as guest lecturers can contribute specialized studies.
The course also stresses a methodological approach which I call one of "comparative cultures."
The Islamic empires and garden cultures bear fruitful comparison with the western nation states,
such as Italy, France, and England, where formal gardens and parks also developed during the
Renaissance and Baroque periods, the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. It is not a coincidence that
during these centuries both Italy and Persia (Iran) were each called "the garden of the world."
Considering "globalizations" and global contacts worldwide as major phenomena in past
centuries, for example in the medieval period, the course covers a majority of the significant
morphological and typological developments in the history of landscape architecture. Often
paradigmatic or foundational in terms of conceptual frameworks, these achievements constitute a
set of design languages and a body of knowledge that continue to be of critical use for modern
designers today.
Gardens and landscape architecture are considered here as complex, ambiguous forms developing
on the borderlines between extant, native landscapes and the spheres of culture and practice. They
are also considered as part of territorial organizations having to do with the political and
economic relations between cities and countrysides. Particular attention is given to activities that
manifest and sustain cultural attitudes to landscape, such as written documents (e.g. private
letters, published guidebooks) and visual representation in landscape paintings, prints and
drawings, and maps/cartography.

Goals and Objectives of the Course:
On a broad level, the course encourages students to situate designed sites and their
conceptualization in historical context, and to recognize their multivalent character and the
fundamental social and interdisciplinary nature of their production, which engages variously with
the spheres of art, architecture, urbanism and planning, ecological and geographical systems,
among others. On a theoretical and methodological level, the course readings encourage an
evaluation of the new thinking about landscape and landscape architecture that has occurred in
professional and academic circles particularly during the last few decades, a period characterized
by interdisciplinary thinking in both professional practice and academic research, which brings
together landscape architecture and other disciplines--geography, history, sociology, art,
architecture, and science.
Through the study of history and theories, this course intends to guide the student in structuring
the range of conceptual categories and contexts, which are specific to the designing of works of
landscape architecture. The key underlying question is: how does one conceptualize the design
of a work of landscape architecture? what are the relevant issues and contexts at hand? Four
frameworks are engaged to structure the course material:
         1. Historical and Theoretical Frameworks: Categories of Reference.
         2. The Formation of Landscape Architecture as a Discipline and as a Profession.
         3. The Inscription of Meanings in Landscape Architecture: Theoretical-Cultural
                 Interpretation
         4. The Relevance of History for the Contemporary Field of Design.
Lectures, Discussion, and Discussion Sections:
Handouts:        Handouts with sites and dates will be distributed to accompany lectures, starting
                 with Lecture 2.
Discussions:     Discussion takes place in the classroom, and students are encouraged to ask
                 questions. Some sessions are devoted to reviewing previously seen material.
Sections:        Discussion Sections (one meeting of 45 min four times during the semester, or as
                 needed, for discussion-preparation of assignments) will be scheduled for
                 undergraduate students. The T.A. will organize these sections. Graduate
                 students should signal to the T.A. if they wish to attend sections.
Field Trips:     If the size of the class enrollment allows for it, some lectures (field trips on
                 campus) will have a seminar format making use of the university's rich resources
                 in rare book rooms, museums, and archives, among them the Harry Ransom
                 Center (rare books and maps); Special Collections in the Architecture & Planning
                 Library; the Prints & Drawings Study Room of the Blanton Art Museum (also its
                 landscape paintings and contemporary art collections); the Map Collection in
                 Perry-Castaneda Library. Such field trips vary from year to year.

A = excellent work that displays conceptual rigor, original research, and insights and ideas that
                           tend to go beyond those presented by the readings or by the instructor in
                           class; excellent writing and superb presentation of the project in terms of
                           Bibliography, Notes, Images. The assignment or essay has a rigorously
                           supported argument. Readings are strongly engaged in the assignment,


Prof. Mirka Beneš       UTexas School of Architecture: LAR 388K             Fall 2019 p. 5
                          and the student takes a position with respect to them, successfully
                          critiquing or building on them.
B = good work that displays thorough understanding of the material and successful completion of
                          the assignment, very good writing, diligent research, fine presentation of
                          the project in terms of Bibliography, Notes, Images. The assignment or
                          essay has an argument that is clear to the reader. Readings are very well
                          engaged in the assignment.
C = satisfactory work that meets the minimum requirements of the assignment, displays no
                          further pursuit of ideas presented in class and in readings, displays
                          limitations in skills, writing, conceptualization, and presentation of
                          project. The argument of the essay or assignment is not clearly presented.
                          Readings are minimally brought into the assignment.
D = poor work that does not meet the minimum requirements of the assignment and does not
                          meet the level of skills required to complete the assignment in terms of
                          conceptualization, writing, and presentation. No attempt to structure an
                          argument is made. Readings are not well understood and are not even
                          minimally brought into the assignment.
F = unacceptable, failing work that includes incomplete assignment or major parts of it,
                          unacceptable delays in turning in the work, unsuccessful performance
                          overall.
