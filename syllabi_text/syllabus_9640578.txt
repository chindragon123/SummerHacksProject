   Intro to Adv Creativity

We do not want things to stay the same.
We like new. We push to come up with new inventions. New products. New ideas.
New music. New art. When something has been done before we call it out. When a
friend posts a link from last week we make fun of them. New is good. Unique is good.
How do we get to new and unique? We get creative. And good advertising is nothing if
not creative.
We’ll address creative advertising in this class, but more importantly we’ll seek to
understand creativity in general and how it doesn’t like to be pigeonholed. This isn’t a
read-and-regurgitate class. You’re going to be involved in an ongoing conversation.
You’re going to DO as well as study. Want to know something? Ask. We’ll figure it out
together. You’ll get a lot out of this class if you put yourself into it.
For those of you thinking about becoming advertising creatives, this is step one…and
it’s a doozy.

things to do.
Think smart. Think weird. Invent. Explore. Share. You’ll attend two lectures a week and submit lab
assignments online. Online video-viewing and readings will be on Canvas. Expect to be graded on
thought-provoking (and fun…no, really) individual and group projects, an idea journal, and in-class
exercises. In addition, be prepared to live the creative life you’re studying...starting now​.
things to don’t.
Cheat - you’ll be caught or worse you won’t.
one second late is a week late.
Don’t turn in late assignments. NO EXCEPTIONS. No really. Late = an automatic “0”. Make
arrangements with your teaching assistant to turn in assignments EARLY if you know you won’t make it
to class. Emergency issues should be handled through Student Emergency Services who will, in turn,
contact me.
there is no makeup test, only Zuul.
Unless you have accommodations from the University and have worked out said accommodations with
me AHEAD OF TIME, there is no extra credit work, makeup tests, or other special considerations.
have an opinion. just make sure you’re right.
You have two days (48 hours) from the date a grade is announced/returned to contest it. No grade
changes will be made at any point after this period. Not 2 business days. No time off for holidays. This is
one place where creativity doesn’t work. Keep in mind, that I reserve the right to adjust your grade in
either direction if you contest it. You’re asking me to take another look. Sometimes I don’t like what I see
the second time. Choose your battles wisely.
i’ll say it. you’ll do it anyway. you’ll regret it in the end.
Don’t be late. Don’t leave early. Mind your interneting in class. Don't let it distract you too much.

the gifts of grading
I curve and I round up final grades. I’ve even eliminated “-” grades to help boost your GPA. Why?
Because I’m a nice guy. That’s all the help you get. There are no extra points given because you’re “SO
CLOSE” to an A, or to passing, or to the Dean. So, don’t ask. It’s truly a despicable thing to do. No,
really. Emails that begin, “I know you said but…” and will not receive a response.
final letter grades are calculated as follows:
A        89.5 to 100
B+       86.5 to 89.5
B        79.5 to 86.4
C+       76.5 to 79.4
C        69.5 to 76.4
D+       66.5 to 69.4
D        59.5 to 66.4
F        0 to 59.4
projects and homework
Project guideline sheets will be posted to Canvas prior to the discussion of each project. Homework
assignments will be posted per the syllabus and will be due according each assignment’s details.
