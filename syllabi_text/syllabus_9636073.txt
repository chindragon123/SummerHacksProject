    ADAPTATION: faithful & faithless adaptation, appropriation, transmediation, translation, recreation, regeneration, extension,
 relocation, reincarnation, re-presentation, recontextualization, reinterpretation, intermediality, remediation, transnationalization,
                                                                  etc., etc...
Description: In this course, we will be examining a series of literature to film adaptations, ones that boldly flout “proper” adaptation
theory and, what some argue are outdated notions of fidelity to the original source text. “Slant” adaptations boldly exhibit what Julie
Grossman calls “elasTEXTity,” an inventive exploration of apparent or submerged aspects of the literary source text; she argues that
these exploratory adaptations often “are born of new concerns, new desires to express human themes in a different medium…
reflecting new cultural priorities” (Grossman, “‘It’s Alive! Alive!’: Hideous Progeny”). New digital and electronic technologies and
media expand the notions of the text, originality, and appropriation, as well. Our source materials include a canonical literary classic
(Wuthering Heights), a philosophical essay, short stories, a European theatrical and cinematic classic (Bergman's Scenes...), and some
inventive, interpretive, far from faithful novel-to-film adaptations.
The literature and film pairings that we will be analyzing in class are case studies; the required critical and theoretical readings are
designed to give us some shared analytical foundations for the course. In the spirit of Independent Inquiry, students are free to work
on literature-to-film adaptations beyond the class’s required and assigned materials.
Required Adaptations: Please note that some (not all) of the required films are available via U.T.’s Kanopy Streaming Service
and most are in the UT library collection at the Fine Arts Library. If a film is not available via Kanopy, you will have to screen it via
Amazon Prime, Netflix, MUBI, or DVD rentals. You are responsible for viewing the film by the date on which we will be analyzing and
discussing it; failure to do so is equivalent to being absent.
