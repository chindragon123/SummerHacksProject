Coastal Communities: Life along the Water in Early America
Neil Kamil / GAR 2.146 / Kamil@austin.utexas.edu / 512-232-6110
Office Hours F 1-3 (and by appointment)
         Most of America’s earliest settlements were coastal communities. Indeed, in
human terms, bodies of water: oceans, lakes, rivers, bays, sounds, tidal pools, ponds, and
streams helped define both the extent and limits of local, regional, and ultimately global
history and culture. Water simultaneously connected and separated through the
movements of highly mobile populations, which communicated through exploration, war,
commerce, migration, and travel along routes sometimes millennia old during a time
when travel by boat was far simpler than overland travel. Hence, while not overlooking
inland zones (river valleys in particular), American history can also be understood within
the broad, transoceanic web of human geography called Atlantic history and culture. The
purpose of this course is to explore the social and cultural history of American coastal
communities from an interactive perspective. Ultimately, then, we are concerned with
understanding ways to think, read and write about water and water-mediated culture as
fundamental modes of contact and communication in the pre-industrial world.
         This course meets substantial writing requirements. Students will read widely
from a multidisciplinary list. One full-length film will be shown. Attendance is
mandatory. Students must contribute regularly to class discussion and turn in brief (2-
page maximum) weekly writing assignments analyzing the reading for that week. These
readings should not be considered standard book reviews; rather, they take the form of
focused essays about problems, issues, and especially questions that the student wants to
ask in the seminar, so they are intended to help facilitate discussion. A 5-7-page final
paper will propose an article to be included in a (fictitious) collection of essays about the
major themes to emerge from this course. Please don’t hesitate to come talk with me as
soon as possible about your final project. We will meet individually in my office towards
the middle of the semester to exchange ideas. Grades: weekly papers (50%); discussion
(30%); final essay (20%). Please be aware that the assignment of grades has always been,
and remains, up to the discretion of the instructor. Students with disabilities may request
appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community
Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259.
         History 350R is on the US Core Course List and may be used to fulfill three
hours of the U.S. history component of the university core curriculum and addresses the
following four core objectives established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating
Board: communication skills, critical thinking skills, personal responsibility, and social
responsibility. This course carries both Independent Inquiry and Writing Flags. Please
