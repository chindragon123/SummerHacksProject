Course Description
This lecture course surveys the political, social, economic, and intellectual history
of the Western world from the later Middle Ages to the beginnings of the
Industrial Revolution. In doing so, the course examines why the transition to
modernity took place in the westernmost part of the Eurasian landmass. How
and why, between the late fifteenth and early nineteenth century, did the crisis of
Western Christendom eventually lead to the emergence of modern society? In
exploring these questions, the course places early-modern Europe and its
overseas expansion in the context of long-term, global history.
Global Cultures Flag
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed
to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You
should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from
assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S.
cultural group, past or present.
Academic Conduct

University of Texas at Austin. The standards and regulations for academic
