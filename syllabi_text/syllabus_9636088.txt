                                   Welcome to UT’s Department of Germanic Studies
     My name is Hannes Mandel, and together with your instructor, I would like to welcome you to our German
  Language Program. We are excited that you have chosen to study German at UT and are looking forward to
  helping you become fluent in both the language and the culture.
     Most likely, you already have had some exposure to a foreign language in high school. This is great, and it will
  help you with some of the challenges that German has in store. Learning a foreign language at the college level,
  however, may be somewhat different from what you have experienced in high school. Our program here at UT
  uses a so-called “functional-communicative approach” that aims to teach you how to use the language as a
  problem-solving tool in a variety of “real life” situations. What this means is that rather than spending most
  class-time on teacher-centered drills, or fill-in-the-blanks activities, we focus on actual, meaningful (group and
  partner) communication in the target language. Like learning to ride a bike, learning a language takes a lot of
  practice, and research of the past several decades has consistently shown the superior effectiveness of such
  communicative approaches in language teaching.
     It does come with one catch, though. In order to be able to practice communicating in class, you must make
  sure to study vocabulary and grammar extensively at home. Our textbook Sag mal comes with an online
  learning platform that greatly supports you in this effort, giving you corrective feedback in real time and the
  opportunity to reach out to your instructor right where you run into a difficulty. I urge you to take your
  homework and class preparation most seriously, as both your success and your peers’ success (as well as the
  fun to be had in class) heavily depend on it.
     Lastly, should you have any questions, concerns, or feedback about the course at any time, both your
  instructor and I very much appreciate you reaching out to us. We are committed to making your language
  learning journey as joyful, exciting, and rewarding as possible! I wish you all the best for the upcoming semester
  and your future as a speaker of German.
                                                                       Dr. Hannes Mandel, Language Program Director
About the Course
German 506 is a first semester German course and assumes no prior knowledge of German. If you do
have prior knowledge of German, we strongly urge you to take a credit by examination test with Testing
& Evaluation Services (TES), or to sign up for a placement interview with the Language Program Director.
(No “easy A” is worth the amount of time, tuition, and opportunity lost!)
As mentioned above, the functional-communicative approach focuses on the application of German in
meaningful contexts in a variety of real-life situations and across spoken and written genres. It goes
hand in hand with the concept of a “flipped classroom”: Unlike in a traditional classroom setting where
you are taught in class and then review or apply what you have learned as part of your homework, the
flipped classroom requires you to prepare for each class ahead of time, in order to then apply what you
have learned in the classroom. Therefore, it is crucial that you:
                                                             1


✅    start a studying routine and always stay on top of the homework,
✅    regularly review vocabulary (using flash cards, see advice below),
✅    ask questions as you have them,
✅    engage actively in the classroom, in pair as well as group activities, and
✅    most importantly: commit to communicating in German as much as possible during class time.
The structure for a lesson will look like this:
1. The homework assigned online has you study the new material on your own, ahead of time.
    (Readings and video materials are typically an exception to this.) Read the textbook attentively first,
    then proceed to the activities and/or online flashcards provided by your instructor.
2. Having done these comparatively simple activities online, you should be well prepared for the class.
    In the beginning of the lesson, your instructor will briefly go over the new material. This is the time to
    ask any questions you may have.
3. After a short refresher activity or two, the class time will focus on “the hard stuff”: applying the new
    “theoretical” knowledge in practice, i.e. in meaningful communication with your class mates and
    instructor.
You should be prepared to study two hours for each class period in order to keep up with the pace of
the class. Students who are not able to make this commitment over the entire span of the semester
should not be taking this course.

Assessment
Your progress in the class will be assessed during the semester across the following categories:
        Participation:             10%              Quizzes:                       10%
        Online Homework:           15%              Short Video Project:           10%
        3 Writing Tasks:           15%              Oral Exam:                     15%
        4 Chapter Tests:           25%
Class Participation and Preparation (10%)
Daily attendance and active participation in class are necessary and expected components to your
language learning experience and will be assessed weekly. You are allowed up to 4 absences for
illnesses, doctor’s visits, family matters, job interviews, etc. Beginning with the 5th absence, your course
grade will drop dramatically (a 1% deduction off of your final grade per day missed). Family
emergencies that can be substantiated or serious illnesses verified by a doctor’s note may be treated as
exceptions at the discretion of your instructor. The following criteria are used to determine your
participation grade:
10 always well-prepared, is attentive and volunteers often; always tries to use German with classmates
      and instructor; makes the most of each activity; shows real resourcefulness and imagination in using
                                                        2


     the language; responds to and engages classmates in a respectful manner; remains critical and
     open-minded toward target and native culture.
8    usually well-prepared; is attentive and volunteers occasionally; tries to use German with classmates
     and instructor; makes the most of each activity; completes exercises with some imagination and
     resourcefulness; makes some effort to engage fellow students; shows some development of cultural
     sensitivity.
5    occasionally prepared and attentive; typically waits to be called upon; occasionally needs to be
     reminded to use German with instructor and classmates; responds and completes exercises with
     minimal imagination; does not engage classmates beyond the minimum.
3    is unprepared; makes little effort to participate or complete exercises; rarely tries to use German
     with instructor or classmates.
0    makes no contribution to class whatsoever; is not on task.
Lastly, make sure to be on time. ‘On time’ does not mean being in the classroom by class time, but
sitting in your chair with course materials and writing utensil ready to go. Every two times you arrive
late to class will count as one full day absence.
Online Homework (15%)
Daily homework is key to your language development. Most of the homework is assigned online through
Sag mal’s accompanying “Supersite” at www.vhlcentral.com. The exercises target reading, listening,
writing and speaking abilities. On the Supersite, you get immediate feedback on exercises. Since you can
do these online exercises repeatedly throughout the semester, they also serve as excellent study tools
for quizzes and tests. All homework must be done by the due date indicated by your instructor.
Homework turned in late will be penalized with -5% for every day late.
Writing Tasks (15%)
Three writing tasks over the course of the semester give you the opportunity to build your writing
abilities in creative ways. Here, the focus is not only on being able to use certain linguistic forms
correctly, but also on developing writing that shows an ability to create a cohesive text and an
awareness of audience within an identifiable genre. Your texts will be assessed according to your ability
to address task requirements, engage with content material, and use appropriately complex and
accurate language. Writing tasks are due on the date indicated on the syllabus. For each calendar day
that a paper is submitted late, the grade for the paper will be reduced by 10%. For the second and
third writing tasks, you will have the option to revise your assignment, based on the feedback provided
by your instructor. The degree of improvement in your grade is in proportion to the effort you put into
your revisions. An exemplary revision may receive up to two half-grade points, while a weak revision
may not improve a grade. You may not seek additional help from outside sources for your first draft
(i.e., more fluent speakers, online translation services, etc.). Doing so is considered plagiarism and will
result in severe academic sanctions.
4 Written Chapter Tests (25%)
Each of the four tests covers material from one chapter. However, since language learning is cumulative,
note that each exam inherently covers all previously learned material. The exams test your knowledge
of and ability to use German language forms (grammar and vocabulary) introduced in the chapters.
Listening and reading comprehension, as well as writing abilities will also be assessed. If you arrive late
for a test, you must still finish the test by the end of the class period. If you miss a test without having
obtained permission from the instructor in advance, you will not receive any credit for the test.
                                                        3


Documented medical or family emergencies, religious holidays, and military service that can be
substantiated to the satisfaction of the instructor will be treated as exceptions.
Quizzes (10%)
To ensure regular studying from the textbook and other instructional materials, there will be four short
in-class writing assignments scheduled across the four chapters targeting key vocabulary and grammar.
Please note that no make-ups will be given for missed quizzes. Also, please be aware your instructor
may give “pop” quizzes in class or assign take-home quizzes to be done outside of class. These quizzes
will count towards your overall quiz grade.
Short Video Project (10%)
The semester will culminate in a Filmfest made up of commercials for German products, produced in
small teams and about 3–4 minutes long. Through this collaborative project you will have the chance to
practice your German in fun and creative ways.
Oral Exam (15%)
The oral exam is designed to assess speaking abilities developed over the course of the semester.
Together with a partner, you will prepare and act out a short role-play related to a chapter topic, and
engage in a brief conversation with your instructor. The exam will be administered during the last week
of classes.
Grading Scale
The following grading scale will be used to determine your final course grade:
      A     93–100%            B      83–86.9%           C     73–76.9%          D     63–66.9%
      A-    90–92.9%           B-     80–82.9%           C-    70–72.9%          D-    60–62.9%
      B+    87–89.9%           C+     77–79.9%           D+    67–69.9%          F     00–59.9%
Please note: There are no incompletes given in German 506. A grade of C or better is required to enroll
in German 507 (i.e., a C- is not a passing grade).
Studying Vocabulary
It is essential for your success in GER 506 that you study vocabulary regularly and thoroughly. We
recommend flashcards. Under https://quizlet.com/hmandel you will find all the vocabulary exactly as in
the textbook, ready for you to study online, on your computer or on your phone. Studying vocabulary
from the textbook is not a good idea!
A few tips: Always study vocabulary both ways: Begin with German > English, then switch to English >
German. Make sure to study genders and plurals along with the nouns, and conjugations with irregular
verbs. Come up with as many mnemonic devices as possible. Pay attention to spellings and practice
pronunciations as you go along, whether silently or aloud. Study the vocabulary items in a different
order each time, and gradually sort out the ones you have mastered. We will address some of these
strategies during the first few days of class, but make sure to seek advice at any time, if you feel your
studying of vocabulary is ineffective.
Opportunities to Speak German
UT and the wider Austin community offers a number of opportunities to practice your German
informally and get to know others interested in the language and culture:
                                                      4


1. Stammtisch*: German Social Hour. Speak German with other undergraduates and graduate students
    from UT, once a week, in a low-pressure and fun environment! Schedule TBA.
2. German Film Series*: Contemporary movies shown in Burdine Hall. Schedule TBA.
3. German Club*: This is a fun and active group for learners of German at all levels of proficiency. Check
    out their Facebook site at https://www.facebook.com/groups/222912318303159.
4. Es klingt wie Deutsch: UT’s student-run German language radio show!
    https://www.facebook.com/Es-Klingt-Wie-Deutsch-214889598551642. The program welcomes the
    participation or even just attendance of speakers of German from all levels of proficiency.
5. Austin German Meetup Group: monthly conversation group: www.meetup.com/austin-german.
*Only during Fall and Spring semester.
Placement Exams
If you are new to UT and have taken German before, or if you have acquired some German in any other
context, we strongly urge you to either take the credit by examination test offered by UT’s Testing &
Evaluation Services (TES, https://testingservices.utexas.edu) or to sign up for a placement interview with
the German Language Program Director, Dr. Hannes Mandel.
Errors and Mistakes
Errors and mistakes are inevitable, in fact, they are crucial for your learning. Your instructor fosters an
atmosphere where mistakes will be treated respectfully. Language learning requires risk-taking, and it is
important for you to feel safe and relaxed, so that you can speak up in front of the class without any
anxiety, even if you are not certain whether your contribution is 100% correct. Please do not hesitate to
contact your instructor if there is anything in the classroom that prevents you from participating fully.
Questions? Concerns? Comments?
We value your feedback. If you enjoy your class, let your instructor know and tell your friends. If there
are any aspects of the class that you do not feel comfortable with, make sure to reach out to your
instructor. If you are not comfortable with approaching your instructor, you are always welcome to
contact the Language Program Director, Dr. Mandel (hmandel@austin.utexas.edu).
Upper-Division German, Majoring and Minoring
It would be a shame if your studies of German would end with the completion of the lower division
program! For information on upper division courses, as well as on majoring or minoring in German,
please go to https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/germanic/undergraduate/Advising.php and reach out to our
Undergraduate Advisor, Dr. Kirkland Fulk.
Study Abroad in Germany
The Department of Germanic Studies offers a number of study abroad opportunities including an
immensely popular summer program (the German and European Studies Summer Program in Würzburg)
that is designed specifically for UT language students like you. We offer two language options: GER 612
(for students who completed GER 506 and 507), and GER 330C, an upper-division Composition and
Conversation course for students who have successfully completed GER 612.
In addition, you can enroll in courses in literature, art history, economics, and politics in Germany,
taught in English. Up to 9 UT credits can be earned. The program also offers a rich cultural excursion
program that includes a 5-day trip to Berlin. Throughout the 10-week program, students are
accompanied by a UT Austin faculty member. For more information, please see our website
(https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/germanic/undergraduate/abroad/Wuerzburg.php), or contact the
program coordinator, Dr. Peter Hess (phess@austin.utexas.edu).

Academic Integrity
Please keep in mind that language learning is a long-term process and necessarily involves making
mistakes. Your instructor is there to help you along the way, but ultimately the effort must come from
you to make the experience worthwhile.
                                       University of Texas Honor Code
      The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
   individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these
        values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
1. Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code. Any work
    submitted by a student in this course for academic credit has to be the student’s own individual
    work, unless the instructor explicitly allows collaboration.
2. You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture
    and the sections with other students. You can give “consulting” help to or receive “consulting” help
    from such students.
3. Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who
    gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for
    violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary
    action.
4. Talking is not permitted during examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or
    collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during examinations will result in failure of the
    exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.
5. The use of online translation services (such as Google Translate and others) is not permissible
    under any circumstance! Unlike dictionaries, such services only provide one (very approximate)
    translation, rather than allowing you to choose among various meanings to find the appropriate word
    or phrase you need. Their results are inaccurate, unreliable, and easy to identify. Besides an F on your
    submission, you will face serious academic consequences.
Students who do not comply with University rules on scholastic integrity are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies are strictly
enforced. For more information, visit http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct.
Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of
Diversity and Community Engagement’s Services for Students with Disabilities. For more information,
see http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability. Academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity
and Community Engagement’s Services for Students with Disabilities are effective immediately
after receiving all proper documents, not in retrospect.
Accommodations for Religious Holidays
By UT Austin policy, students must notify their instructor of pending absence at least fourteen days prior
to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
                                                        6


Use of Email for Official Correspondence to Students
All students should become familiar with the University’s official email student notification policy. It is
the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in their email address.
Students are expected to check email on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with
University-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is
recommended that email be checked daily, but at a minimum twice per week. The complete text of this
policy and instructions for updating your email address are available at:
https://cio.utexas.edu/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy.
The class will use the course management site Canvas, accessible to each enrolled student through their
UT Direct account. Email reminders and updates will be sent through this site.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone in the UT community, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line
to discuss your concerns with professional counselors. This service is provided through a partnership
among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the
Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-
232-5050 or visit www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Counseling and Mental Health Center
College life can be overwhelming. If you ever feel distressed, the Counseling & Mental Health Center
(CMHC) provides counseling, psychiatric consultation, and prevention services that facilitate your
academic and life goals, and enhance your personal growth and well-being: http://cmhc.utexas.edu.
Title IX and Sexual Harassment
The University of Texas at Austin is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is free from
discriminatory conduct based on gender. As required by Title IX, the University encourages any student
or non-student who thinks that he or she has been subjected to sex discrimination, sexual harassment
(including sexual violence) or sexual misconduct by another student, member of the faculty or staff, or
campus visitor or contractor, to immediately report the incident to any of the persons or offices listed
below.
Institutional Title IX Coordinator                 Deputy Title IX Coordinator for Students
University Compliance Services                     Student Emergency Services

                                                   512-471-5017
Students may also report incidents of sex discrimination, sexual harassment (including sexual violence)
or sexual misconduct to any university Responsible Employee, who is then required to promptly notify
any of the above Title IX coordinators of the reported incident. Complaints or allegations of student-on-
student sex discrimination, sexual harassment (including sexual violence) or sexual misconduct will be
handled by the Office of the Dean of Students. Cases of sexual violence may also be reported to the
University of Texas Police Department, the City of Austin Police Department and other local law
enforcement authorities. The Title IX Coordinators can assist individuals with contacting these law
enforcement agencies. More information under https://titleix.utexas.edu.
Gender Neutral Pronouns
Please do not hesitate to let your instructor know the pronouns you prefer to go by. As you may know,
grammatical gender plays a significant role in the German language. While no standards for gender
neutral pronouns have been established in contemporary German yet, some ideas and suggestions exist.
                                                      7


We will be happy to inform you to the best of our ability, and strive to create an inclusive and
welcoming classroom for everyone.
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when
an alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please note the following policies regarding
evacuation:
• Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the
    nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
• Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform their instructor in writing during the first
    week of class.
• In the event of an evacuation, follow your instructor’s instructions.
Do not re-enter a building unless you are given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT
Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
SB11
According to SB11 (“Campus Carry”), individuals who hold a required license are eligible to carry a
concealed handgun in this classroom. UT Austin is obliged to follow SB11 to the letter and is not at
liberty to enact policies or provisions that violate it. Any changes to the law must come through the
state legislative process. Instructors may not impose a ban on concealed handguns in their classrooms. If
you consider exercising this right, please consult the relevant policies in the Handbook of Operating
Procedures (https://www.policies.utexas.edu/policies/campus-concealed-carry). The open carry of
handguns is not permitted anywhere on campus, including this classroom. Anyone who sees an openly
carried handgun anywhere on campus should immediately call 911.
