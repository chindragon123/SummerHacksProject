Bienvenue!
Welcome to French 611C hybrid, the second-semester French course offered at the University of
Texas. This course offers the best of both worlds, by combining the new and up to date Français
interactif online content delivered via Canvas with two face to face sessions per week during which


time you are interacting in French with your classmates, your instructor, and the course materials. All
of the course materials you need are embedded within Canvas. There is no book for this course.
In addition to working independently through the online activities in Canvas, we will also be meeting
on Tuesdays and Thursdays all semester, either in Zoom or on campus. You should expect a
substantial amount of work and preparation outside of class, similiar to what you experienced in FR
601C, but with an additional 3 hours (minimum) to account for the removal of three in-class sessions
per week. For summer, this will be even more intense since we have to cover the same amount of
content in less time.You are expected to come to class prepared and ready to engage in interactive
activities. This course follows the dates of the regular University of Texas semester.
In FR 611C, we use our first-year French curriculum, Français interactif, a unique beginning French
program developed at the University of Texas. Français interactif helps you explore the French
language and culture by following the lives of real UT students who participated in the UT Summer
Program in Lyon, France. The UT students will introduce you to their French host families, their
French university, and their lives in France.
In addition to following the exploits of these UT students, you will also watch videos of native French
speakers as well as scenes of day-to-day interactions (e.g., vendors in the market, waiters at a café,
children getting ready to go to school, etc.) These video-based materials give Français interactif an
authenticity and immediacy lacking in most commercially produced textbooks. Authentic materials
from many other sources have also been incorporated into this hybrid course.
The goal of this course is to continue to develop your listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in
French. You will learn useful vocabulary, grammatical structures, and cultural information, all naturally
embedded in the videos and online activities.
Prerequisite
FR 601C (or equivalent) with grade of C or above.
If you opted to take FR 601C pass/fail in Spring 2020 and did not receive a C or higher, you will likely
struggle in FR 611C. If at any time you feel you are not understanding the content, reach out to your
instructor for help right away. Be aware of the drop dates and know your options.
Attendance and Preparation
Daily preparation, regular attendance, and active in-class participation are essential to your success
in learning French. This includes being ON TIME for class. In between our "Seances", you will need
to spend a great deal of time going through each assigned lesson.


For this 6 hours class, we are only in class together for 3 hours per week (fall/spring semester), so
you are expected to participate in all class sessions. Participation grades are recorded for each face
to face session. When you are not present, you will receive a zero. Your instructor will explain how
you will be self-assessing your in-class participation in the "Note de participation".
For students with special needs presenting documentation at the beginning of the semester from the
SSD, approved provisions and accommodations will be made. Be sure to schedule an appointment
to discuss your needs with your instructor early on to avoid any misunderstandings. Also, please
keep in mind that accommodations are not retroactive, so it is important to present proper
documentation as soon as it is available.
Canvas Assignments
Regular and persistent preparation, as well as active participation in class, are essential to your
success in learning French. While many of the at-home asynchronous activities do not count towards
your grade, you are expected to work through them thoughtfully, paying close attention to the details.
You will need to spend a great deal of time studying and repeating the vocabulary to help you learn
and internalize it. The Tex's French Grammar is meant to be read thoroughly before you move on to
the activities. Bref, you cannot rush through the lessons just to get them done, and expect to learn
French successfully.
Any activity that is not auto-corrected in Canvas and needs to be graded by the instructor, will count
as a homework grade. With each submission, you will be able to see your answers and the correct
answers. When you submit paragraphs, audio and video recordings, and certain other types of
“open-ended” responses, your instructor must grade these individually, so the feedback will not be
instantaneous.
Keep track of all assignment due dates indicated on the course syllabus. Once a due date and time
passes (always 11:59 pm), the online activities remain open, but will be automatically marked LATE
by Canvas. No late submissions will be allowed. You will receive a zero for all late
submissions. You must submit all activities in sequential order to be allowed to progress through the
course.
The next set of activities in Canvas will open after each in-class session or "Séance". So after each
Séance, the lessons leading up to the subsequent Séance will go live. As I mentioned above, you
must work through the materials progressively as they appear. In other words, you cannot move on to
Leçon 5 until you have completed Leçon 4, and so on. The course has been set up so that Canvas
will block you from doing this, or from skipping over activities.

You must receive a grade of a C or higher (73% or higher) in order to continue on to FR 317C,
the next course in the sequence. A grade of a C- is not sufficient to continue on to FR 317C.
No extra credit will be offered in FR 611C under any circumstances.
Technical Requirements
     Reliable internet connection
     A computer or tablet with microphone and webcam (always do a sound check before and after
     submitting your recorded activities)
     Canvas is designed to be compatible with Google Chrome, so if you are using a web browser
     other than Chrome, you might not have full functionality in Canvas, and Canvas will act very
     glitchy. Bottom line, use Chrome as your browser for Canvas.

Canvas and Tech Problems
If you ever have a problem with a Canvas assignment, such as an answer that you know is correct,
and Canvas is showing that it is not, please email your instructor immediately so it can be fixed. For
all technical issues, first, make sure you are using Google Chrome. If you are and the problem
persists, contact Canvas Support. You can access this 24/7/365 support through the HELP menu in
the lower-left corner of the orange Canvas interface:


If your personal computer is having issues (camera or mic not working, videos not uploading, etc.), it
is your responsibility to borrow a computer to complete your assignments or to have your tech issues
addressed by a professional immediately. This will not be a valid excuse to not complete an
assignment, so it is a good idea to not wait until the last minute to complete assignments, particularly
when submitting media files.
Additional Information
Lower-Division French. For additional information on lower-division French courses, please contact
Dr. Nancy Guilloteau, Lower-Division French Coordinator, at nguilloteauut@gmail.com
(mailto:nguilloteauut@gmail.com) .
Academic Integrity. Academic dishonesty on any graded assignment will result in a zero. Academic
dishonesty includes any kind of cheating. In language classes, this includes the use of online
translators. Be aware that such behavior can have far-reaching consequences, and can result in
suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information, visit
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis.php
(https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php)
In order to receive full credit on assignments in FR 611C, you are expected to use only the
vocabulary and structures that have been learned in 601C and this course to date. Producing perfect,
native-like paragraphs and other work with the aid of unauthorized technological or personal
assistance will result in a grade of zero. Use of Google translate or other aids is considered
scholastic dishonesty and will result in a zero and possible further action.
Special Needs. The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of
the Dean of Students at 471-6259 or 471-4641, or go to http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd
(https://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/)


For students with special needs presenting documentation at the beginning of the semester from the
SSD, provisions and accommodations will be made. Please keep in mind that accommodations are
not retroactive, so it is important to present proper documentation as soon as it is available.
Code of conduct. The dean may initiate disciplinary proceedings under subchapter 11-300 against a
student who conducts himself or herself in a manner that impedes, interferes with, or disrupts any
University teaching, research, administrative, disciplinary, public service, learning, or other authorized
activity. For more information and a complete list of Student Standards of Conduct, please consult
http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi08-09/app/gi08.appc03.html#subchapter-11-300-initiation-of-
disciplinary-proceedings.
All students are expected to assist in maintaining a classroom environment that is conducive to
learning. Inappropriate behavior (frequent tardiness, offensive or insensitive remarks, talking out of
turn, sleeping, overt inattentiveness, harassment or bullying of the instructor or other students, etc.)
shall result, minimally, in a recorded absence and/or a request to leave class. Repeated inappropriate
or disruptive behavior will be reported to the Dean of Students and can very quickly escalate into a
judicial matter.
