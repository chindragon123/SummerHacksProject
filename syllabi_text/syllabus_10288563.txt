COURSE DESCRIPTION
The goals of this course are threefold. First, this class analyzes the connections between
academic and community-driven solutions to some of today’s most intractable social problems,
particularly those structured by race, gender and class inequality. What role do students
(especially those in Black Studies) play in relation to such problems? Second, to serve as an
introduction to social movement theory. How have grassroots movements carried-out their
visions and strategies for liberation over the past half-century? Third, to provide AFR majors the
opportunity to work collaboratively with Austin organizations and agencies that are addressing
social justice or pressing issues discussed throughout the semester.
Flags:
    §   Ethics: This course carries the Ethics flag. Ethics courses are designed to equip you with skills that are
        necessary for making ethical decisions in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a
        substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments involving ethical issues and the process of
        applying ethical reasoning to real-life situations.
    §   Cultural Diversity: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. The purpose of
        the Cultural Diversity in the United States Flag is for students to explore in depth the shared practices and
        beliefs of one or more underrepresented cultural groups subject to persistent marginalization. In addition
        to learning about these diverse groups in relation to their specific contexts, students should engage in an
        active process of critical reflection. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to
        come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one underrepresented
        cultural group in the U.S.
    §   Independent Inquiry: This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are
        designed to engage you in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing you with the
        opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related to your major. You
        should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from the independent investigation
        and presentation of your own work.
                                                                                                                     1

Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the
date of observance of a religious holy day in writing. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only
allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop .
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
      “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the
      University and uphold academic integrity.”
This means that work you produce on assignments, tests and exams is all your own work, unless it is
assigned as group work.
Always cite your sources. If you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in a
previous class), you must make that clear, otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to
academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course.
You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty Policy which can be found at the
