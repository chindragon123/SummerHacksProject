Required Text & Readings:
Aitchison, Jean (2012). Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon (4th edition)
         New York: Wiley Publishers.
+ Articles in Canvas, per topic


                                   GRADING POLICIES
1. A total of 400 points may be accrued throughout the semester. Attendance is mandatory and
the attendance policy detailed below will be enforced. Individual letter grades per exam or
assignment will NOT be recorded, only points earned are recorded.
GRADING SCALE:
       A (94-100%)          376-400 AND at least 90% attendance record
       A- (90-93.5%)        360-375 AND at least 90% attendance record
       B+ (87.5-89.5%)      350-359 AND at least 85% attendance record
       B (84-87%)           336-349 AND at least 80% attendance record
       B- (80-83.5%)        320-335 AND at least 80% attendance record
       C+ (77.5-79.5%)      310-319 AND at least 80% attendance record
       C (74-77%)           296-309 AND at least 75% attendance record
       C- (70-73.5%)        280-295 AND at least 75% attendance record
       D+ (67.5-69.5%)      270-279 AND at least 75% attendance record
       D (64-67%)           256-269 AND at least 70% attendance record
       D- (60-63.5%)        240-255 AND at least 70% attendance record
       F     (0-59.5%)      0-239 AND/OR less than 60% attendance


2. ALL ASSIGNMENTS MUST BE COMPLETED FOR A FINAL GRADE TO BE ISSUED.
(Having earned enough points for a C does not mean a student is exempt from the written
assignment, quizzes, or any exam.)
3. Assignments are considered late if they are not turned in BOTH during class (paper copy)
and into Canvas/TurnItIn (electronic copy) on the day on which they are due. NO
ASSIGNMENTS will be accepted by email. Grades are final; questions and appeals must be
made within 2 class periods.
3. For those taking the class on the Credit/No Credit or Pass/Fail option: If you are officially registered for the course
on a Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit basis, you may opt out of one major requirement (1 Exam OR 1 written assignment)
AS LONG as you meet the following requirements: (a) at least 70% of possible points for the remaining assignments
(TOTAL – missed exam/assignment), (b) attendance of at least 75% for EACH Exam section (i.e., 75% before Exam I;
75% between Exam I and II, and 75% between Exam II and III).
Lap Top/Computer/Cell Phone Policy: Attendance means both physical and psychological
attendance. Lap tops may be used ONLY to take notes. Students who will be using lap tops for
note-taking MUST first earn a license to do so. A license can be earned by reading research
about the potential educational hazards of lap-top use in the classroom, and taking a short quiz on
the information.
         Anyone caught using technology in a distracting way, or for any other reason than taking
notes, will have attendance negated for that day; a second offense will result in the student not
being allowed to use a lap top in class.


Email/Communication Policies:
1. Please use the Canvas email system to contact the professor. Put PSY 337 or the class name
(“Psych of Lang”) in the title of all emails to the teaching assistant (or use Canvas system to
contact TA).
2. ALL attendance issues must be dealt with IN PERSON with Dr. Reeves—either after class or
during office hours.
3. Please check syllabus or assignment papers to make sure the answers to your questions have
not already been addressed. Exam- and assignment-related questions are best asked during
class announcements. For all other queries, please permit up to 48 hours response time for all
emails; urgent matters should be discussed in person with the professor or TA.
Instructions for Quizzes: Quizzes on the required readings will be available through the
Canvas system. The required chapter/s and/or articles must be read before taking each quiz,
and each quiz completed by a deadline. The deadline for each quiz will be posted in
Announcements, and you will typically have 1 hour to complete each quiz. Top 10 quiz grades
will be counted (there will be at least 12 quizzes available).
*It is highly recommended that you save answers as you go. Students who are kicked out of a
quiz may make up ONE quiz by paper and pencil, as long as the paper-version of the quiz is
completed by the quiz deadline. Thus, it behooves students to take the quizzes early in order
to have an extra day or two to take a quiz if you are closed out of one. Simply show up to the
instructor’s or the TA’s office hours after you are closed out of a quiz.

EXAM III: Saturday, July 13th, 7 p.m.


Class Expectations:
        1. Mandatory Attendance: attendance will be taken regularly. Much academic benefit is
gained from participating in a community of learners. Less than 70% documented attendance
may result in failure of the class.
        2. Stay up to date: Read the relevant textbook chapters after we have begun coverage of
that topic in class. Lecture outlines will be provided in Canvas, but are NOT intended as a
substitution for class attendance or the textbook.
        Experts advise that students spend 2-3 hours studying out-of-class, per hour of in-class
time, in order to earn a passing grade. This means students should spend an additional 6-9
hours studying Psychology of Language EACH week of class (not including the time spent in
class).
        3. Update your email address in the UT system, as important class-related messages
will be sent out regularly. The instructor and TAs cannot be responsible for missed messages due
to full mailboxes, etc.
        4. Please keep instructor apprised of any extenuating circumstances before they interfere
with your work. I am sympathetic if I know you’re trying to fulfill your responsibilities.
        5. University of Texas Honor Code: The core values of The University of Texas at
Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility.
Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty,
trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
        No Plagiarism in Any Form: Students are expected to turn in their own work. Plagiarism
or scholastic dishonesty in any form will result in disciplinary penalties, including possible failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University (Section 3.22, Chapter IV, Rules and Regulations
of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System; www.utesystem.edu/bor/tocrrr.htm).
Plagiarism includes all of the following:
        a. Copying an answer from a classmate or other source during an exam.
        b. Borrowing or copying part of another person’s paper during out-of-class
        assignments.
        c. Citing an author’s or researchers’ IDEAS, paper organization, exact wording, or
        graphs/figures without giving that person proper credit through an APA-style citation or
        footnote.
        d. Borrowing from, or using outright, papers obtained on-line or through other
        sources which I myself have not written or supplied the background research.
