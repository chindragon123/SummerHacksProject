Course Description
This course focuses on the analysis of variance and includes one-way, factorial, and repeated measures designs
along with the analysis of covariance.
The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the principles underlying commonly used
experimental design and analysis approaches. Specifically, students will learn to select an appropriate experimental
design given a research question of interest, develop a conceptual understanding of the experimental design and
analysis model, develop a working knowledge of how to analyze data arising from commonly used experimental
designs, and be able to properly interpret and communicate analysis results.
Prerequisite
This course requires the use of several intermediate level mathematical/statistical skills and understanding. The
prerequisite for the course is EDP 380C 2-Fundamental Statistics. The instructor may approve equivalent graduate
level courses.
Canvas: https://utexas.instructure.com
Announcements, course handouts, assignments, and grades will be posted on the course Canvas site.
Required Materials
• Textbook
    Readings for this class have been aligned with Stevens (2007) though you are encouraged to use a variety of
    resources to support your mastery of the topics covered in this course.
    Stevens, J. P. (2007) Intermediate statistics: A modern approach (3rd ed.) New York: Lawrence Erlbaum
    Associates.
• Calculator
    During exams, classmates may not share calculators nor may a calculator on an electronic device be utilized.
• SPSS
    There are different versions of SPSS available and they might look somewhat different from the version
    demonstrated in class and the screenshots in the course handouts. As these versions change, please be flexible
    about the location of the relevant SPSS functions.
    Access to SPSS:
        o Computer lab on campus (MEZ 2.104)
        o CoE Desktop (https://desktop.edb.utexas.edu)
        o Purchase a license through the UT Campus Computer Store, UT Software Distribution and Sales,
             OnTheHub, etc.
                                                                                                                   1


Optional Materials
• Lecture handouts
      Lecture handouts will be made available on Canvas. Students are encouraged to have these available during
      class to simplify note-taking.
Classroom Expectations
Do not text, surf the Internet, check Facebook, email, etc. during class time as this distracts both you and the
students seated around you. Please turn off your cell phone ringers when in class.
Class Attendance
Students are responsible for all material presented in lectures. It is expected that students will attend lectures,
however, attendance will not be taken. If a student misses a class, regardless of the reason, the student is
responsible for obtaining both the course material that was missed as well as any class announcements from their
classmates.
Graded Assignments/Evaluations
This course is designed with the hope that students recognize the need to become actively involved with the
material to improve their mastery of it. There are many and frequent assignments but they are designed to provide
you with the practice necessary to become fluent in this subject area. The only way to master these techniques (as
is the case with most mathematical topics or techniques) is to use them. Thus, each of the assignments is designed
to provide you with the opportunity to apply these techniques. There will be three types of assessments. Each type
is listed below with a brief description.
1. Homework (100 points total). Watching the instructor perform and interpret analyses can result in the illusion
      of understanding. Only by running analyses yourself can you ensure your mastery of the material.
      Computational and interpretation practice will be provided in the form of homework.
2. Labs (100 points total). Labs are designed to enhance your SPSS competence. Labs are completed during the lab
      time. The highest scoring lab will replace the score of the lowest scoring lab (in other words, the highest lab
      score will be double counted and the lowest lab scoring lab will go away).
3. Exams (2 @ 150 points each). There will be two in-class exams. Each exam will consist of conceptual,
      computational, and application questions. Students must bring a calculator to the exams.
Grading Scale
Final grades will be assigned based on the percentage of accumulated points.
    Overall Course Percent     Grade         Overall Course Percent    Grade        Overall Course Percent     Grade
    93% - 100%                 A             80% - 82%                 B-           67% - 69%                  D+
    90% - 92%                  A-            77% - 79%                 C+           63% - 66%                  D
    87% - 89%                  B+            73% - 76%                 C            60% - 62%                  D-
    83% - 86%                  B             70% - 72%                 C-           below 60%                  F
Regrade Policy
If you think there may be an error in grading or grade input in Canvas, you should bring it to the instructor or TA’s
attention. Be prepared to discuss what problems you see with the grading. There is a one-week window (up to the
last class day of the session) from the time the grade is posted to make the instructor or TA aware of a grading or
input error. After that, the grade is final.
                                                                                                                      2


Late Policy
Late assignments (homework and labs) are not accepted.
Missed exams may not be made up unless arrangements have been made prior to the class exam administration
and the reason for missing the exam falls into one of the following categories:
• a UT-sponsored activity → provide the appropriate documentation to the instructor before the exam
• an emergency or illness → contact Student Emergency Services
     (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/). They will provide the appropriate resources as well as inform
     all of your instructors as to what day(s) you have been excused.
• religious holy day → contact the instructor at least 14 days prior to the absence
If the instructor is not contacted about the event prior to the exam, a grade of 0 will be recorded for the missed
exam.
Assignment Deadlines
All of your work must be submitted before the deadline. For example, if an assignment is due at 9:00pm and you
submit your work at exactly 9:00pm, it will not be accepted (even if it is one second after the deadline).
Suggestions:
• Start your work early
• Plan to turn in your work at least an hour before the deadline so that you can manage issues that may arise
Canvas Submissions
Assignments will be submitted via Canvas. It is your responsibility to ensure that your submissions are fully
uploaded to Canvas by the deadline.
If you experience a Canvas issue and cannot upload an assignment through the system before the deadline, contact
Canvas directly for technical help and email the assignment as well as a screenshot of the Canvas error to the
instructor or TA prior to the deadline. If this is done, the assignment will not be considered late. Emailing to state
you are experiencing a problem, without including the assignment as an attachment, will still count as a missed
assignment and will not be accepted.
                                                                                                                       3


                                                     University Policy
Scholastic Dishonesty Policy
You are encouraged to study together often. However, there are times when you need to demonstrate your own
ability to work and solve problems. Students who violate these expectations can expect to receive a failing grade,
be referred to the appropriate university officials, and may receive a maximum penalty of suspension or even
expulsion from the University. For more information on scholastic dishonesty, students may review the Student
Judicial Services website: http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/.
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, falsifying academic
records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty also
includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading information to receive a postponement or an extension
on a test or other class assignment, and submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses
without the prior permission of faculty members.
Use of Class Materials
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams and homework assignments are copyright
protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the class materials is a violation of federal law and may result in
disciplinary actions being taken against the student. Additionally, the sharing of class materials in any form,
including the assignments you submitted, without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation
of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary
action. This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those
materials with other current or future students.
Students with Disabilities
The University of Texas provides, on request, appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with
disabilities. At the beginning of the semester, students who need special accommodations should notify the
instructor by presenting a letter prepared by the Service for Students with Disabilities (SSD) Office. For more
information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities at (512) 471-6259 [voice], (866) 329-3986 [video phone],
via e-mail at ssd@austin.utexas.edu, or visit: http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/.
Religious Holy Days
Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. It is the policy of The University of
Texas at Austin that you must give your instructors sufficient notification (at least 14 days) prior to the classes
scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a religious holy day.
CMHC
CMHC Crisis Line is a confidential service of CMHC that offers an opportunity for UT Austin students to talk with
trained counselors about urgent concerns. A counselor is available every day of the year, including holidays. You
can call when you want, at your convenience. Telephone counselors will spend time addressing your immediate
concerns. CMHC 24/7 Crisis Line: (512) 471-CALL (2255).
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to
discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a partnership
among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee
Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call (512) 232-5050 or visit
