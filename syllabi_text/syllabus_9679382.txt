Course Objectives & Philosophy: Organic chemistry is the study of life. They either form the basis of,
    or are important constituents of, many products including plastics, drugs, petrochemicals, food,
    explosive material, and paints. After taking OChem I and II students would be able to understand
    the basic functionality of organic molecules and devise sound synthetic routes of constructing
    complex organic molecules from smaller fragments. In addition to basic analysis of organic
    molecule (strain and stability, stereochemistry etc.) 70% of OChem-I was about learning reactions
    that interconverts functional groups into one another for example: How to convert an alkene to an
    alkane? How to convert an alcohol into a haloalkane etc. While majority of OChem-II (~90%) is
    about learning carbon-carbon bond forming reactions that allows the construction of bigger complex
    organic molecules from smaller fragment. This requires a higher level of analytical thinking. You
    would be challenged to look at the whole picture instead of a single reaction. This exercise would
    condition your mind so that you can apply this new way of thinking to complex problems that you
    would face in your upper division classes.
Prerequisites: Chemistry courses CH 320M or CH 328M with a grade of at least C-
Website: Materials for the course are available at http://canvas.utexas.edu
Texts: Organic Chemistry (William H. Brown, Brent L. Iverson, Eric Anslyn, Christopher S. Foote), 8th
    Edition, ISBN: 978-1305580350. Student Study Guide and Solutions Manual for the above
    textbook, ISBN: 978-1305864504.
Homework: There will be two kinds of homework assigned in this class.
Homework I. This is graded HW will be uploaded on Canvas weekly and collected in the class. Give it
    to TAs by the beginning of the class when it is due. Late HW will not be graded. You will receive a
    grade of 0, 0.5, or 1 on each assignment. A 1 means that you have accurately completed ~80% of the
    HW, a 0.5 means that accurately complete ~30% of the HW and 0 means you did not turn it in or
    did not complete ~30% of your HW. The tally of these 1, 0.5 and 0 will add up as % of your total
    grade. If your HW grade is not correctly listed on canvas you must be diligent and alert your TA's
    immediately and they would fix the error, after three days changes to HW grades would not be
    made.
Homework II. This HW would not be collected or graded. Second type of homework will involve book
    problems that are assigned, but not collected. These are extremely important, as the only way to
    master organic chemistry is to work many, many problems over the course of the semester. You will
    note when taking the exam that most of the exam problems are directly out of the tougher homework
    problems both from weekly and the book problems. You would notice that exam problems are
    formatted or closely resemble your weekly homework problem.

Add/drop period: Last day of the official add/drop period is July 16.
Electronics: Because audible electronic devices interrupt lectures and discussion, you may be asked to
     leave the lecture hall or exam room if you bring to class noisy cellular phones, pagers, timers, etc.
     You may bring a calculator to the exams. Your calculator must be a hand-held, non-programmable
     device that cannot communicate by wireless transmissions.
Requirements and Grading:
The raw scores earned on each of the exams in this course will be converted to Standard T-Scores. The
                                                             ùíô‚àíùëø
Standard T-Score is computed as follows:               T = [( ùíî )‚Ä¢10] + 80,    where:
x = your raw test score
                                     ùë•ùëñ
X = the class mean score = ‚àëùëÅ   ùëñ=1 ùëÅ
N = the number of test scores
                           ‚àëùëÅ           2
                             ùëñ=1(ùë•ùëñ ‚àíùëã) ¬Ω
s = standard deviation = [     (ùëÅ‚àí1)
                                          ]
Using Standard T-Scores allows an effective averaging of grades without introducing a bias in favor of
tests with the greatest standard deviations. Since it is based on a normal (Gaussian) distribution, it
generally represents the fairest way of grading. (Nearly all national exams such as the SAT, MCAT, and
GRE use a similar form of Standard T-Scores).
Your final course grade will be calculated as 30% of your best midterm T-score, 30% of your second
best midterm T-score and 40% of your final exam T-score. There will be two midterms during the
semester, so this means that your lowest midterm exam T-score will be dropped OR you will be able to
miss one midterm for any reason with no penalty. Your lowest midterm exam score can also be replaced
by your Final Exam score (if you scored higher on your Final Exam).
*Students who cannot take one midterms due to medical, religious or personal reasons would be able to
use this option.
*Missing two midterms or the final exam without a documented, valid excuse will result in a failing
grade.
         Midterm Exam #1:              30%
         Midterm Exam #2:              30%
         Final Exam:                   40%
The following conversion table will be used to calculated final course grades:
              Score                 Grade                         Score           Grade

     83.0000 ‚â§ T < 87.0000             B                 63.0000 ‚â§ T < 67.0000      D
     80.0000 ‚â§ T < 83.0000            B-                 60.0000 ‚â§T < 63.0000       D-
     77.0000 ‚â§T < 80.0000             C+                      T ‚â§ 60.0000            F


    NOTE: WE DO NOT ROUND SCORES. AN 89.92 IS ENTERED AS 89.92, NOT 90.00. When
    the instructor makes the final grades in the class, there will also be no rounding of grades. Missing a
    grade cut off by any fraction of an amount is a miss!
    In general, using T-scores increases everyone's grades compared to using absolute percentages.
    Nevertheless, we will keep track of your percentage scores on every test. If the percentage scores are
    ever higher than your T-score, we will use the percentage score for your course grade calculation.
    Thus, if everyone does extremely well in this course, no grade will be lowered by using a curving
    system!
    Two midterm exams will be given during the course of the semester. They will be held on Tuesday
    in class from 8:30-10:30 am.
    You will be responsible for all material covered up to the Friday lecture the week before each
    midterm. The pace of the class can vary, so do not be concerned of we are not on the same schedule
    as described below under ‚Äúschedule‚Äù. The bottom line is that you are only responsible for the
    material covered in the previous Friday lecture.

Regrades: Exams that have been written in pencil or erasable ink will not be regraded. If you believe
    your exam was graded incorrectly, describe your complaint on a separate sheet of paper, attach it to
    the front of your exam, and give it to me. All problems on the exam will be regraded. You can
    request a regrade up to one week after that exam has been returned. Complaints about the final exam
    grading must be presented within one day of the return of the final exam. Therefore, if you
    anticipate a complaint, you must be diligent in following the progress of the graders. To guard
    against altered exams being submitted for a regrade, we routinely copy a large number of exams
    following grading but prior to handing them back.

Academic Integrity: Exams and homework will be considered your own original work, prepared
    without unauthorized assistance. Violations of this policy can result in a recorded score of 0 for that
    assignment, a reduced or failing grade for the course, and additional disciplinary action administered
    by the Office of the Dean of Students. If you have questions about this policy, please ask me before
    submitting your work or consult the Student Judicial Services website. The use of electronic devices
    capable of transmitting information is prohibited during exams.
    Common violations of the academic integrity policy are plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, and
    submission of a modified exam for regrading. Please make sure you understand when it is
    acceptable to work together with a classmate and how to present your answers in your own words
    and figures. Do not alter any exams that you will submit for regrading.
Letters of Recommendation: I will only write letters of recommendation for exceptional students with
    whom I have regularly interacted.
University of Texas Honor Code: The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning,
    discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the
    university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
    toward peers and community. Any violation of the above Honor Code that occurs during an exam or
    in the regarding process will result in a 0 being assigned for that exam and the student involved will
    be formally reported to the Dean of Students, where they will be subject to additional penalties or
    actions. The exam with the 0 will be automatically counted in the final grade calculation at the end
    of the semester.
Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students: Email is recognized as an official mode of
    university correspondence; therefore, you are responsible for reading your email for university and


    course-related information and announcements. You are responsible to keep the university informed
    about changes to your e-mail address. You should check your e-mail regularly and frequently‚ÄîI
    recommend daily, but at minimum twice a week‚Äîto stay current with university-related
    communications, some of which may be time-critical. You can find UT Austin‚Äôs policies and
    instructions for updating your e-mail address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
Documented Disability Statement: If you require special accommodations, you must obtain a letter
    that documents your disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Division
    of Diversity and Community Engagement (471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf
    or hard of hearing). Present the letter to me at the beginning of the semester so we can discuss the
    accommodations you need. No later than five business days before an exam, you should remind me
    of any testing accommodations you will need. For more information, visit
    http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.
Religious Holidays: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence for an exam at
    least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss an exam
    in order to observe a holy day, I will give you an opportunity to take a make-up exam.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): If you are worried about someone who is acting differently,
    you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another
    individual‚Äôs behavior. This service is provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean
    of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program
    (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit
    http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Emergency Evacuation Policy: Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to
    evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please
    be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
    ‚Ä¢ Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the
         nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
    ‚Ä¢ If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
    ‚Ä¢ In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
    ‚Ä¢ Do not re-enter a building unless you are given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the
         UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
