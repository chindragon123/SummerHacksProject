Course Description:
This upper-level undergraduate writing course deals with the anthropological analysis of
queer gender and sexuality. Its aim is to critically evaluate formative concepts and theories
that have been subject to recent debates within Anthropology, Gender Studies, and Queer
Theory. Through the reading of a variety of ethnographies from Asia and the Americas, we
will partly explore how terms like “women” and “men,” “femininity” and “masculinity,” as
well as “homosexuality,” “heterosexuality,” “bisexuality,” and “transsexuality” structure
people’s experiences, but also how local terminologies inform sexual identity formations
around the globe. In this vein, the course focuses on local-level social and cultural processes
that challenge a wide range of heteronormativities within a regional and global framework.
The basic theme of the material for this course concerns the extent to which both realities
and the ways in which they are perceived are socio-cultural constructs that are subject to
constant change.
        This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write
regularly during the session and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve
your writing. You will also have the opportunity to go to the University Writing Center, and
you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Because students fulfill
three hours of their Core Communication requirement with a Writing Flag course, courses
flagged for writing address the following new “core objectives”: Critical Thinking Skills: to
include creative thinking, innovation, inquiry, and analysis, evaluation and synthesis of
information. Communication Skills: to include effective development, interpretation and
expression of ideas through written, oral and visual communication. Teamwork: to include
the ability to consider different points of view and to work effectively with others to support
a shared purpose or goal. Personal Responsibility: to include the ability to connect choices,
actions and consequences to ethical decision-making.
                                                                                             1

Course Requirements for Registered Students:
The class relies on the intellectual commitment and active participation of all students. It
will be run primarily as general discussions with some lectures based on the assigned
reading. In order for the course to be effective, all students must have the reading
assignments completed and ready for in-depth discussion before each class. Regular
attendance is required. Mere attendance in class, however, does not constitute
participation. You must come to class having carefully read all materials and be prepared to
discuss, question, and argue about issues raised in the readings. It will be beneficial for you
to take excepts/notes on any material that you find enlightening, controversial, or
objectionable. You should also take notes in class on themes, key terms, and debates we
discuss. These note-taking strategies will be crucial when you write your response papers. In
short:
                                                                                              2


     -   Attend all classes.
     -   Do all assigned readings (while taking excerpts/notes!) by the date indicated on the
         syllabus and participate actively in class.
     -   Regular two 10-minute presentations (by two students, based on turn-taking) on the
         assigned readings. The presentations are intended to launch the general seminar
         discussions. These presentations can be brief summaries of the materials read and
         should end with one or two questions the presenters want the class to engage with
         during the session.
     -   Three Take-Home Exams to be handed in during class on Tuesday, September 25th,
         Tuesday, October 23rd, and Tuesday, November 13th [the assignment should be
         exactly 3 full pages of text (double-spaced/12 points/Times Roman)], plus one cover
         page indicating your name and the prompt question. The prompt will be posted on
         Canvas the Thursday before it is due and it will cover a theoretical question based on
         the assigned readings.
         THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP EXAMS!
     -   One Three-page paper based on a joint/group project that is based on observation
         and deals with a topic focusing on queer life on and around the UT Austin campus to
         be handed in during the final week of the semester. The Project will be first
         discussed with and approved by the instructor. Groups will be constituted by an
         average of three individuals. There is one joint paper for each group and every
         member of the group will receive the same grade.
     -   10-minute presentations on the respective final group project during the last week
         of the semester. Every group member needs to present on one aspect of the joint
         project.
The three take-home exams are designed to develop critical reading, analytical, and writing
skills. Evaluation criteria include: critical and integrative analysis of texts, clarity of thought,
ability to synthesize readings and class discussions into your own argument, and ability to
formulate a theoretical grounding for it. A visit to the University Writing Center in The
Perry-Castaneda Library, 101 E 21st St #2.330 is highly encouraged! Students who consult
with the Writing Center and have the instructor officially notified by email will earn
additional 2 points on their respective papers.
 The Student Honor Code states: “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall
          abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.”
PLAGIARISM/CHEATING:
Anyone plagiarizing and/or cheating will first be given an “F” (Fail) and a report will be
forwarded to the appropriate university authorities.

Notice regarding academic dishonesty (e.g. Plagiarism)
    • Honor Code or statement of ethics.
              o University of Texas Honor Code: Each member of the university is expected

According to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, to “plagiarize” means
    • to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own.
    • to use (another's production) without crediting the source.
    • to commit literary theft.
    • to present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source.
In other words, plagiarism is an act of fraud. It involves both stealing someone else's work
and lying about it afterward.
All of the following are considered plagiarism:
    •    turning in someone else's work as your own.
    •    copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit.
    •    failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
    •    giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation.
    •    changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit.
    •    copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your
         work, whether you give credit or not (see our section on "fair use" rules).
Most cases of plagiarism can be avoided, however, by citing sources. Simply acknowledging
that certain material has been borrowed, and providing your readers with the information
necessary to find that source, is usually enough to prevent plagiarism.
