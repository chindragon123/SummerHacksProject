IV.        Critical Thinking Exercises
A critical component to connecting our course materials to our daily clinical practice is sharing our own
experiences as well as learning from the experiences of others. A significant portion of this course is comprised of
writing your thoughts, yet in your future profession, you will also be required to vocally articulate your
perspective. Thus, almost every week of the semester you will either be required to develop a video blog related to
a critical thinking exercise that has been assigned to you for that particular week or you will be required to listen to
and respond to questions related to someone else’s video blog. Please refer to canvas for specific content and
formatting instructions as well as the related rubric for the completion and analysis of these video blogs.
V.         Experiential Learning Labs
The exam format for this course is authentic as opposed to traditional. You will be provided authentic clinical
scenarios and required to respond in a manner that displays higher order, analytical, and synthetic thinking.
Completion of exams in this format will strengthen your understanding of the breadth and depth of the research


                                                                                                                       3
that exists to date. Navigating these Experiential Learning Labs will also advance your ability to translate theory to
practice.

Please make an appointment with me as soon as possible if you need course adaptations or accommodations

VII.      Students with Disabilities
Please notify your instructor of any modification/adaptation you may require to accommodate a disability-related
need. You will be requested to provide documentation to the Dean of Student's Office in order that the most
appropriate accommodations can be determined. Specialized services are available on campus through Services

http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/
VII.    Religious Holy Days Observance Policy
The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student from attending
classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including
travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized for that
absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the student is
excused within a reasonable time after the absence.


                                                                                                                       4
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious
holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be
made to complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence. For more information on this policy
go to:
http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi03-04/ch4/ch4g.html#attendance
VIII.   Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, falsifying
academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic
dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading information to receive a postponement
or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same written assignment for
two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these
guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and
readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty
are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. For information regarding this policy go to:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php.
IX.    Students Privacy and Web-based Class Sites
Web-based, password-protected class sites are available for all accredited courses taught at The University.
Syllabi, handouts, assignments and other resources are types of information that may be available within these
sites. Site activities could include exchanging e-mail, engaging in class discussions and chats, and exchanging files.
In addition, class e-mail rosters will be a component of the sites. Students who do not want their names included
in these electronic class rosters must restrict their directory information in the Office of the Registrar, Main
Building, Room 1. For information on restricting directory information got to:
