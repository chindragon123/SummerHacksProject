 INTRODUCTION
Health care is an exciting and evolving field in which government policies play a vital role. The
course is designed for undergraduate students who seek an understanding of how to apply basic
microeconomic tools to the study of health and medical care issues. This course will examine the
special features of medical care as a commodity, the demand for health and medical care services,
the economic explanations for the behavior of medical care providers, the functioning of insurance
markets, federal health insurance programs, and regulation. Finally, this course will examine ideas
for health care reform. Empirical results, current issues, and policy applications will be discussed
throughout the course.
Prerequisites: Intermediate Microeconomics (420K) is an essential prerequisite for this course.
If it’s been a while since you took intermediate microeconomics, the textbook provides a review in
Chapter 2. Chapter 3 reviews statistical tools for health economics.
 COURSE MATERRIALS
Required Reading: The Economics of Health and Health Care, Folland, Goodman and Stano, 8th
Edition (Taylor & Francis, 2017)
Additional Reading: Additional required and optional readings from sources other than the
textbook will be posted on the course website (see below).
The course outline gives the chapters and articles that correspond to the lectures. For better
understanding of the course material the assigned reading must be finished before the class period.
Website: Course material will be on the university’s Canvas system. In particular, homework
assignments will not be handed out in class; they will be posted on Canvas for students to download.
This class will also use the Grades feature on Canvas so that students can keep track of their scores
on assignments and exams.
POLICY ON STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon receipt appropriate academic adjustments for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
Students—Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259.
                                                  1


SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY POLICY
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
EVALUATION AND GRADING
 Tests. There will be two exams and a comprehensive final exam. If you have an emergency that
prevents you from taking an exam, I need to be notified by e-mail or phone no later than the day of
the exam. There will be no make-up exams for the midterms. Should dire circumstances (e.g.
illness) prevent you from taking a test, its weight will be added to your final exam.
Problem Sets. Three problem sets will count towards your final grade. All assignments may be
obtained at the class web page. Collaboration among students in working out problem sets is
encouraged, but you must write up your own homework. Questions very similar to the problem
sets will appear on the exams. It behooves you to make sure that you understand and can present
the solutions to problems on your own in spite of working on the material with one another.
Turning in identical problem sets will result in a zero for both parties. Problem Sets are due at the
beginning of class on their due date. Problem sets WILL NOT be accepted late. This is an absolute
policy. Please do not ask for extensions. Answer keys will be posted after the due date.
Policy Paper. You will be required to complete a policy paper that applies economic methodology
to investigate the economics of a health care issue. Theoretical, empirical, or critical review papers
are acceptable. Pure literature reviews (i.e., a type of book report) are unacceptable; you must
display some original thinking. The paper should be no longer than 5 pages, and will be due on
July 11. More details will be discussed in class on June 28.
Grading Policy: A letter grade will be assigned based on your weighted course average score and
your performance relative to the rest of the class. Letter grades include A, A-, B+, ... , D, D-, F.
