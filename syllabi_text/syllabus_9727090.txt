                                    REQUIRED TEXTBOOKS:
        How Humans Evolved by Boyd and Silk; W.W. Norton & Co., 2018; 8th Edition.
                                     COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Biological anthropology (also called physical or evolutionary anthropology) is the study of the
behavior, ecology, and evolution of primates, including humans. As a scientific discipline,
research in biological anthropology is (1) empirical and (2) grounded in the scientific method.
ANT 301 is intended to provide an introduction to the field of biological anthropology and an
overview of its sub-disciplines. ANT 301 is also designed to provide the necessary foundational
knowledge needed for all upper division courses in biological anthropology. The first 2 weeks of
class focus on living primate diversity. The remaining lectures focus on three main topics: 1)
primate behavior and ecology, 2) micro- and macroevolution, and 3) primate and human
evolution. Labs focus on the collection and analysis of quantitative data, and provide an
opportunity to explore key concepts, osteological material, and fossil material discussed in
lectures. Please be advised that you will be required to take measurements directly from human
skeletal material for some labs.
This course may be used to fulfill the natural science and technology (Part II) component of the
university core curriculum. Courses meeting this requirement are designed to give students an
appreciation of the current state of knowledge in two or more areas of natural science and
technology, and to help students understand the methods, approaches, and theories that scientists
use to answer questions about the natural world. To meet these core objectives, students taking
ANT 301 are expected to gain a detailed understanding of biological evolution and adaptation
(considered foundational knowledge in all life sciences). Students are also introduced to a range
of scientific concepts and methods that are central to biological anthropology and related
scientific disciplines (e.g., biology, geology, and paleontology).
                                      ON-LINE MATERIALS:
All lab documents will be made available online through Canvas at: http://canvas.utexas.edu
You are required to download and print out your lab documents and bring them to class.
NOTE: Students arriving without appropriate materials will not receive credit for lab.
Power Point files used in class and lab lectures will NOT be made available on-line.
                                                LABS:
You may go to any TA’s office hours to ask questions, but you must attend the lab section
for which you are enrolled. If you have an excused absence from lab due to sickness or other
legitimate reasons, you must provide your TA with appropriate documentation (e.g., doctor’s
note) and make arrangements to attend another lab section that week. To schedule an alternate
                                                                                                  2


time, you must contact both your TA and the instructor of the lab section that you wish to attend
in advance. Students abusing this privilege will have the option revoked and will receive a score
of zero for any missed lab.
Please note that documentation of an excused lab absence will NOT be accepted if provided
more than 7 days after the missed lab.
                                              GRADING:
There will be three general exams covering lectures and reading assignments. All general exam
questions will be objective format (e.g., true/false, matching, fill-in-the-blank, and short answer).
All exams will be non-cumulative. THERE IS NO FINAL EXAM.
There will also be two lab practical exams in which you will be required to identify or describe
objects (bones, fossils, stone tools, etc.). Any students arriving after a lab exam has begun will
be penalized one letter grade (e.g., 10 points off the exam). Any student arriving 10 minutes or
more after a lab exam has begun will receive a grade of zero for the exam.
DO NOT MISS AN EXAM. Make-up exams will be given ONLY when medical or family
emergencies can be documented. If you miss an exam due to an emergency, you must contact
your professor ASAP and provide documentation within 5 days of the exam. FYI: If you are sick
on an exam day, don’t ask the Student Health employee who schedules your appointment for a
note – get one from the physician, PA, or nurse practitioner who sees you.
Exam scores will not be curved during the term. If you have any questions about your grade on
any exam, Prof. Kirk will be happy to recheck your whole exam if it was completed in indelible
ink. Please write out a short statement explaining your specific concerns (e.g., incorrect addition
of the number of wrong answers on a page, why you think that a question was graded incorrectly
and what you think the correct answer should have been, etc.). Then give your (1) written
explanation & request for a re-grade and (2) your original exam to Prof. Kirk. You have 1 week
after the exams have been returned to you to notify Prof. Kirk of any errors or disagreements.
After that, grades are final.
Your grade for the semester will be based on the following four components:
                        Exam 1 ------------------------- 25%
                        Exam 2 ------------------------- 25%
                        Exam 3 ------------------------- 25%
                        Cumulative Lab Score -------     25%
Your cumulative lab score will be calculated based on the formula:
                        Lab Midterm ------------------- 25%
                        Lab Final (non-cumulative)-- 25%
                        Lab Exercises ------------------ 50%
                                                                                                    3


                                         Final Grade Ranges:
A 93-100; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76; C- 70-72; D+ 67-69;
D 63-66; D- 60-62; F 0-59
                                   OTHER GRADING POLICIES:
- All grades for the semester are final and non-negotiable. Students will not be provided with any
opportunities for bonus work to increase their final grade.
- Documentation of excused absences from an exam will not be considered more than 1 week
after the date of the exam.
                                       CHEATING POLICY:
During exams, students will not be permitted to wear hats or use electronic devices of any kind.
Ear buds and headphones must be removed. Please silence cell phones before an exam begins. If
your cell phone rings during an exam, do not remove it from your pocket, backpack, or purse. All
exams must be completed using a pen with indelible ink, or you will forfeit the opportunity to
request a re-grade of your exam. BE ADVISED that on exam days, students will only be
allowed to take a pen to their seat. All backpacks, book bags, purses, drinks, food, jackets, etc.
must be left at the front of the auditorium. If you're worried that someone might take your bag by
mistake, don't bring it to class.
Without exception, any student found cheating on an exam or lab assignment will receive a grade
of zero for the exam or lab assignment and will be referred to the Office of Student Judicial
Services for disciplinary action. Note that any attempt to alter a graded, returned exam in order to
improve the score will be considered cheating and will result in a grade of zero for the exam.
Please note that sharing information about an exam with a student who has not yet taken the
exam will be considered cheating, regardless of the means by which the information is shared
(e.g., verbally, on a web page, via email, via text message, etc.). For example, a student with a
Monday lab who shares information about a lab exam with students in a Thursday lab by posting
lab questions on a group text is cheating – both the student sharing the information and student(s)
using the information will receive 0% credit for the exam. Students who observe cheating via
electronic media or other means are encouraged to inform the professor or their TA.
                                SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS:
If you require special accommodations for exams (e.g., a reduced-distraction environment or
extra time), you must contact your instructor and teaching assistant at least 7 days IN
ADVANCE of the exam in order to discuss the necessary arrangements. There will be no
                                                                                                   4


exceptions to this rule. Proof of qualification for accommodations from the UT Services for
Students with Disabilities (SSD) office must be provided. Each time a student wishes to use an
approved accommodation for an exam, it is the student’s responsibility to notify and make
arrangements with his/her TA.
A student is free not to use an approved accommodation. However, if a student opts out of an
accommodation for one exam and then decides to use it for another exam, it is the responsibility
of the student to make advance arrangements with his/her TA.
                                ELECTRONIC DEVICES POLICY:
Cell Phones – The “Alamo Drafthouse Policy”: Please keep cell phones dark, silent, and out of
sight for the entire class period. Research conducted here at UT shows that having a visible
cell phone is a major distractor in class, even if the phone is face down or turned off. As a result,
in addition to not having your cell phone sitting in your lap or on your tabletop, you are
encouraged not to even have it in your pocket and to instead turn it off and place it in your
backpack or purse. If Dr. Kirk sees a cell phone, he will ask you to put it away, so please don’t
disrupt class by having one out. If a student has to be asked to put a cell phone away more than
once, s/he will be asked to leave the classroom.
Computers: Feel free to take notes on a computer. However, no one is allowed to make audio or
video recordings of lectures under any circumstances. Similarly, no one is allowed to photograph
the Power Point slides during lecture. Please inform your professor or TA if you see anyone
photographing or making audio or video recordings of the lecture so that we may eject him/her
from the lecture hall. Please note also that students who use their computers for anything other
than taking notes will be asked to turn their computer off.
                                         OTHER POLICIES:
Please do not sleep, talk, or text in class. Students engaging in disruptive behavior of any kind
will be asked to leave the auditorium.
GUNS AND “CONCEALED CARRY” AT UT: While I cannot ban licensed concealed
handguns from my classroom, I can exercise my first amendment right to let you know that I
would strongly prefer that you NOT bring them into my classroom. I CAN legally ban licensed
concealed handguns from my faculty office. Thus, this (and my reading of this statement aloud
in class) is my official notification that you may not bring any concealed guns into my faculty
office.
[Note that by state law, long guns such as rifles are prohibited in university buildings and open
carry of handguns is prohibited across campus.]
                                                                                                    5
