What is a “global city”? Journalists and social scientists alike argue that the global city is a recent invention of
the 1990s, brought into being by new technologies, the end of the Cold War, and new immigration legislation.
Characterized by transnational residents, dramatic socioeconomic stratification, economic connections between
international marketplaces, and high levels of tourism and real estate speculation, the global city is, according
to these commentators, a radically new form of urbanism. In this course, we will complicate this narrative by
taking a longer view of the global city. In addition, we will seek to examine how placing global cities at the
center of our analysis changes our understanding of both urban history and the history of U.S. global power.
Our readings in this course seek to understand the relationships between the local and the global from the mid-
nineteenth century through the present. To examine these relationships, we will concentrate on four distinct
but overlapping questions: How have the structure and culture of work in the United States been influenced by
transnational developments, including war, immigration, and the relocation of jobs? How have cities served as
centralized sites for the movement of money, and how can we read these business functions in the landscape?
How has U.S. global power been represented culturally in urban space? And what politics are made possible
or foreclosed by transnational movements of people, money, and ideas? We will be paying careful attention to
how these relationships have shifted over time.

Course Format
This is a discussion seminar, and we will spend most of our time discussing the assigned readings. Occasionally, I will
give brief lectures to provide a historical overview and place the readings into context. However, the emphasis in each
class session will be on discussion of both the assigned reading and primary materials that we will examine together in
class. Because of this format, it is essential that you complete all of the assigned reading each week. If you have
concerns about keeping up with the reading, please get in touch with me immediately.
The aim of this course is help you to think historically and analytically. We will work to figure out what we are able to
know about the past; which sources can help us to get at that knowledge; and what the limits and silences of various
types of sources might be. At the same time, we will consider how the authors we read construct arguments, and we will
critically evaluate the persuasiveness of these arguments. Ultimately, you will be working out the tensions inherent in
thinking through how the past can—and should—matter in the present.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this course, students will:
      1. have a deeper knowledge of the history of the history of U.S. global power and urban history, and how the
           emergence of global cities have influenced and been influenced by broader social and cultural forces.
      2. be able to understand and articulate the ideas and perspectives of historical actors.
      3. have a greater understanding of how historians construct arguments based on historical research.
      4. be able to evaluate primary source evidence in relation to secondary sources.
      5. be able to construct an original argument from an evaluation of primary source evidence.
Flags
This course carries the Independent Inquiry Flag. Independent Inquiry courses are designed to engage you in the
process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing you with the opportunity for independent investigation of a
question, problem, or project related to your major. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to
come from the independent investigation and presentation of your own work.
This course also carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with writing in
an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing
projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity
to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core
Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established
by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
Attendance and Participation
You are expected to attend every class and to come prepared. Class sessions will primarily involve discussion of the
assigned texts, and if you are absent or unprepared, you will not be participating fully in the course and it will adversely
affect your grade. You are expected to be an active participant in the class, which means meaningfully contributing to
classroom discussions. If you have concerns about classroom participation, please come discuss it with me – we may be
able to make modified arrangements if speaking up in class is challenging for you.
You must bring the readings with you to class each day (book or course packet).
                                                                                                                             2


If you are going to be absent, you must notify me by email, in advance if possible. If you need to miss class for medical
or religious reasons, your absence will be excused as long as you notify me. By UT-Austin policy, you must notify me
of a pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a
class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
If you have three unexcused absences, your grade will be lowered by a half of a letter grade for each subsequent
absence. Please note that excessive tardiness will also affect your grade.
Laptops may be used for notetaking only. Please do not have your cell phone out during class. (If you are expecting an
emergency call or otherwise need to have your phone available during class, please let me know.)
Students adding the course after the first meeting must make up missed assignments. Please contact me immediately in
person or via email to make up missed work.
I prefer to communicate by email. I will be communicating to the class via email throughout the semester, and I will be
using only your UT email address unless you instruct me otherwise. Please make sure that your UT email address is
working and that your mailbox has space. You must check your UT email daily. You are responsible for all
communications sent via email.

Your attendance and class participation grade depends on your coming to class prepared and participating in discussion.
We may also do occasional in-class journaling and reading response exercises that will count toward this part of your
grade.
We will discuss your two short papers (the primary source analysis and the synthesis essay) in class. Your final research
paper will be a 10-12 paper on a topic relevant to the history of energy and capitalism. We will discuss how to choose a
topic more thoroughly in class. You must use at least two primary sources, two secondary sources (not from the course
syllabus), and two in-class readings to write this paper. You will present your research to the class during the last week
of the term.
All papers should be submitted electronically via the class Canvas site.
                                                                                                                           3


You need to secure an excuse from me at least 3 days before the due date if you have a legitimate reason to turn in
work late. Unexcused late work will lose 1/3 of a letter grade per day late and will receive a failing grade after 5 days.
No extensions will be granted for more than 3 days beyond the original due date except in the most extreme
circumstances.
Lateness policy for the Final Research Paper: Your research paper is due on May 15 by NOON. Unless you have
prior authorization from me to turn it in late, for each hour that your exam is late, you will be deducted 1/2 a grade.
Grading Guidelines
We will discuss writing expectations clearly and thoroughly in class before the first assignment is due. In general, you
should strive for the following in your essays:
      • Your essay should not simply summarize the material but analyze it.
      • You should have a clear and debatable argument.
      • You should clearly use evidence from your sources.
      • You should demonstrate critical thinking in your writing.
      • Your communication should be clear and grammatically correct.
      • You must follow Chicago style for citations of your sources.
