Course Description
In the US, music is often viewed as a form of passive entertainment. However, scholars have found that
music also effects how we think about the world around us and communicates values about ourselves and
others. This course will investigate the ways in which music has been used to bring communities together on
the one hand, and as markers of difference and exclusion on the other. We will focus on two central
questions: 1) how do people use, respond to music to signify their own belonging; how do people use music
to mark themselves or others as different?; 2) does music reflect the experience of same or difference, or
does music create senses of belonging and difference?
        Together we will explore how has been used to bring together or separate people by generation, race,
gender, place and nation state, ethnicity and disability. We will do this through readings, listening sessions,
films and other experiences using case studies from communities in the US and abroad. You will also
interrogate course concepts through debates, group discussions, individual writing, and your own on-going
research project. We will also learn how people use music in their lives by exploring various methodologies
for learning about music: interrogating scholarly research; observing and participating in music events;
                                                        1


engaged and critical listening; examining materials of music (instruments, programs, commercial media
presentations, playbills and other historical documents, notation); conducting interviews.
        This course will involve readings, listening, film and video viewings, through which we can analyze
how music signifies belonging and difference. The larger goal of the course is to explore how music
functions not simply as simply entertainment or as an expression of emotion, but as a vehicle for creating a
sense of self, community and other. We will examine and discuss musical sound, but the course does not
require musical analysis. We will also interpret and analyze music as a symbolic field with references to
other non-music realms, such as visual symbols, language, political ideology, and other referents.
        This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience
with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester,
complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your
writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and to read and discuss your
peers' work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written
work.
Seminar activities will include:
1) Responsible discussions Throughout the session, you will participate in in-class discussions and debates
on course concepts and materials. You will be expected to use evidence, citations, proofs, music, sound and
images to support your claims. You are encouraged to discuss your own case study topic in light of the
course issue at hand as well as any of the readings, listening and viewing examples.
2) Participate Each student must participate in 10 Canvas discussions (2 pts each) to get 20 points towards
your final grade. Your post must be up on the Canvas discussion site by 11 am before the class AND you
must be present in the class meeting to get full credit. You may provide support for or argue against the
questions posted, but you must provide evidence and cite the source of your evidence. Note: whatever
position you take, you MUST do the following to receive credit:
        1) address the question asked;
        2) provide evidence from the class readings, listening or viewing materials;
        3) do not repeat information from your classmates’ posts
3) Critical evaluation of a variety of sources in class discussions, lectures and written assignments:
        Written materials
        In class lecture-demonstration
        Ethnographic interview
        Study of music-related archival materials
        Written and documented case-studies
        Engaged listening and viewing of music and music-related materials such as film.
4) Synthesis: testing a claim about music through case study in your research project and writing
assignments. You will also use information from case studies to modify your initial claim.
5) Writing skills: You will have opportunities to improve your writing through peer editing, writing
proposals and drafts, and revisions through re-writing. This is intended to guide the steps for your research
project, and more broadly to work on university-level writing skills.
I have also set up a discussion forum (“coffeeshop”) for sharing information related to course content.

Required reading; listening; viewing:
There are no required books for the course, but required and alternative readings will be posted online
through Canvas. You MUST plan to bring readings and/or notes from your readings to class in order to refer
to the materials. Listening examples will be streamed through Canvas. We will also view several films in
class that demonstrate issues of musical belonging and difference, as well as explore various websites and
online videos. These movies will also be put on reserve for additional viewing, or for required viewing when
we are not able to finish viewing in class. I may change or tweak the materials according to course needs, so
please pay attention to the assignments sheets. If there are significant changes or many small changes, I will
revise the syllabus accordingly. As typical of university seminar requirements, you are expected to prepare
your readings and assignments for class.
Attendance Policy: As this is a summer course in a seminar format, it is essential that you come to class
prepared and ready to engage with the questions, the instructor and your classmates. Missing a class means
you have missed a significant amount of material and ideas beyond the assigned readings or listening.
Minus 1 point for every unexcused day, late or missed.

Academic Guidelines and Resources
Accessibility: This course requires significant reading, writing, and discussion. Students who have
disabilities, permanent or temporary, that affect their ability to participate in class or outside work, should
meet with the teaching team as soon as possible to discuss accommodations that will make possible your full
participation. We strongly recommend that you obtain specific accommodation requests through UT Services
for Students with Disabilities (http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability) at (512) 471-6259, VP: 1-512-410-6644 or
email <sssd@austin.utexas.edu>. We recognize that not all disabilities are documented with SSD and are
committed to accommodating disabilities (whether documented or not), provided we can do so in a way that
ensures equitable grading for all students in the class. Meeting face-to-face is strongly encouraged so that we
can take the necessary time to work out logistical details related to specific requests.
Non-Discrimination: Title IX, a segment of the Education Amendments of 1972, makes it clear that
violence, harassment, or discrimination based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the
same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected
categories such as race, national origin, etc. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you
can find the appropriate resources at https://www.utexas.edu/student-affairs/policies/title-ix
                                                          3


Academic Integrity: Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty (including cheating on
tests, plagiarism on written assignments, etc.) are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility
of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. You will spend time in your sections learning
on how to properly cite the sources you use in your research essays, so that you will be equipped to avoid
unintentional plagiarism. All suspected cases of cheating and plagiarism are to be reported to Student
Judicial Services. If you have any question about what constitutes academic misconduct please visit the
University of Texas Student Judicial Services website:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/academicintegrity.html
Religious Holy Days: By UT Austin policy, you must notify the teaching team of your pending absence at
least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an
examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Writing Center: As this is a writing-intensive course, the teaching team strongly encourages you to consult
the University Writing Center (UWC) - PCL 2.330, 471-6222 (uwc.utexas.edu). Your instructors may
recommend that you use this resource if they note writing issues. The fastest way to schedule a CSC
appointment is to register for a UWC account at uwc.utexas.edu/appointments, and/or call the UWC Front

facilitate students' academic and life goals and enhance their personal growth and well-being. The CMHC
crisis line is available 24/7/365 at 512-471-2255.
Emergency Evacuation Policy: Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling
outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the
nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation
shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the
instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin
Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
CLASS POLICIES
Assignments are due to Canvas by the beginning of class time. Late work (non-approved extension) will
be graded down. Make-up assignments and/or extensions of deadlines must be discussed with the
instructor and would be arranged only under exceptional and documented circumstances. You will be able to
re-submit revised assignments to canvas which will be re-graded if you show improvement and attention to
instructor’s comments. All revisions must be submitted no later than 1 week after you receive your graded
work.
Discussion protocols
You are expected to behave as a professional scholar. This includes showing respect to the instructor, guest
lecturers and classmates during discussions and disagreements. In my experience, courses that explore issues
of music and identity often have a transformative impact on individual students and their awareness of
identity in their own lives. To respect and support this goal, it is important that the classroom is treated as an
open and safe forum that welcomes diverse perspectives. All participants in this course must respect the
affiliations and identities of all participants on any basis, including, but not limited to, race, color, ethnicity,
national origin, religion, gender identity, disability, or sexual orientation. As we will be reading, listening to,
and witnessing a variety of viewpoints on the relationship between music and identity, there are four guiding
                                                               4


tenets that are crucial for providing a safe environment. Three of these (generosity, provisionality and
community were proposed by anthropologist Tom Boellstrof; communication was added by Prof. Seeman.
Generosity
All readings selected for the syllabus are insightful and theoretically innovative. Critiquing aspects of the
readings is fine, but if you find yourself rejecting an argument in toto, this indicates your reading is
insufficiently generous. Look for ways that the readings can be useful to you. In other words, try on the
concepts and perspectives, walk around in them, and see the world around you through them, put them in
dialogue with other ideas. Your critique will be stronger for having a firm grasp of the ideas first.
        Generosity with readings also means tolerance for new or different ideas. By listening with an open
mind to ideas or opinions that may seem foreign to you, or contradict your values, you may find your own
perceptions have been enlarged, or, contrarily, that your previous values seems more pertinent. But for either
to happen, it is necessary to first give yourself the space to consider different viewpoints.
Provisionality
You are allowed (indeed, encouraged) to think out loud, say something and then take it back, and generally
speak in a provisional manner, knowing that those around you will be patient, supportive, and slow to take
offense. I do not expect you to arrive at class having full mastery of every possible permutation of the subject
under discussion.
Community
Some individuals are quite comfortable speaking at length: I encourage this, but I reserve the right to ask
persons to wrap up their comments, or to solicit comments from persons who have not yet participated in any
particular course meeting. Some of the topics we will be discussing may be both politically and personally
sensitive, so I ask for your good will and awareness of the feelings of others. When you are facilitating a
discussion session, please be aware of giving everyone equal opportunities to participate.
Communication
Finally, if there are aspect of the course, assignments, discussions, audio or visual materials that cause
concern or confusion, please contact me by email and/or during office hours.
Laptop/phone policy:
You may open up your laptop or other device for specific pre-arranged class exercises and note-taking
ONLY. I have found that use of such equipment often leads to engaging in activities not related to class such
as email, facebook, cruising the internet highway, work for another class. If you are observed engaged in
such activity, you will be asked to leave the classroom to take care of your other business and counted as
absent (-1 point each time). This policy is meant to ensure your participation and maximum learning
experience.

What and where is the orient? What are the characteristics of “oriental”? According to whom, at what time,
and where? How is orientalism a form of colonialism? According to Klein, how did US middle class
understand “Asia” and “the East”? How was this understanding related to consumerism and consumption?
How can “The King and I” be understood as a story about US-“Asian” relations, and middle class beliefs
about itself?
