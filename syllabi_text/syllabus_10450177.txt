                          FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE
I.     STANDARDIZED COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course is based on the following assumptions: 1) membership in a population-at-
risk group (e.g., people of color, women, gay and lesbian persons) significantly
influences an individual’s life experiences, world view, and increases risk factors for
exposure to discrimination, economic deprivation, and oppression; 2) professional social
work ethics and values demand culturally competent practice; 3) it is necessary for
students to learn to apply social justice approaches to influence assessment, planning,
access to resources, intervention, and research; and 4) professionals and programs
have strategies to critically analyze distributive justice, human and civil rights, and
global interconnections of oppression. There is an emphasis in this course on the
impact of discrimination and oppression by individuals and society on people of
culturally diverse backgrounds and orientations.
II.    STANDARDIZED COURSE OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
    1. Critique and apply social justice approaches to influence assessment, planning,
       access of resources, intervention, and research;
    2. Demonstrate familiarity with the history and heritage of population-at-risk groups,
       including women and culturally diverse populations, globally as well as those
       prevalent in the southwestern region of the United States;
    3. Understand the social construction of race and ethnicity, gender, and sexual
       orientation;
    4. Examine the personal and professional use of self in ethical, culturally
       competent, and socially just social work practices;
    5. Assess the impact of discrimination (e.g., racism, sexism, homophobia) and
       oppression on public policy, institutional structure, service delivery, and one’s
       own role in promoting social and economic justice.
                                                                                         1

IV.     TEACHING METHODS
This course is designed to provide an interactive online experience, including face-to-
face via Zoom (like a traditional class) and online instruction.
Online sessions are a blend of direct instruction, and self-paced individual tasks using
online platforms and web resources.
This course is designed to provide you with a meaningful learning environment through
use of multiple methods of instruction (e.g. discussion, lecture, and group exercises);
experiential learning (e.g. service-learning, role playing, & active learning) will be
emphasized. You are expected to complete assigned readings, watching, and activities
prior to each class period. You are expected to participate in class. Class attendance is
required and essential for successful completion of this course. This course will use an
electronic Canvas site. Canvas will be used for turning in assignments, grading, and
communication between students and instructor.
                                                                                          2

VIII. CLASS POLICIES
1. Conduct and Civility: Social work students adhere to the Student Standards for
Professional Conduct of the NASW Code of Ethics and assume responsibility for their
conduct. Scholastic honesty and integrity are to be consistent social work values. The
instructor will comply with University guidelines regarding scholastic dishonesty,
including plagiarism. Social work practitioners respect others; therefore, differences in
values, opinions, and feelings of class members and guest speakers will be respected.
                                                                                             4


Students will help create and support a learning environment that does not interfere with
the learning of fellow students. When students voice an opinion with which you do not
agree, feel free to voice opinions in a civil manner that can enhance the flow of ideas
and dialog.
2. Readings and Preparatory Assignments: Students are expected to be active and
participate in the learning process, and in an interactive framework between collegiate
students and professor. Students are also expected to complete readings and
preparatory assignments prior to class. Failure to demonstrate through discussions in
class, online, and through assignments that one has comprehended the readings will be
considered when assigning the final grade. Students are responsible for the material in
the assigned readings whether or not the material is covered in class. Professor
reserves the right to conduct quizzes should there be a pattern of students not
demonstrating that they have completed the readings and are not prepared to engage in
thoughtful discussion.
3. Class Attendance Policy: Punctuality and timeliness are important for social work
practitioners. Class attendance is expected. Attendance is defined as students’ attentive
physical presence in class for the entire class. Establishing a pattern of late arrivals and
early departures will negatively affect your grade. The instructor should be notified in
advance of any planned absence and as soon as possible in the case of an unforeseen,
serious emergency.
4. Assignments and Grades: Assignments should be turned in online on the date they
are due, barring serious, unforeseen medical illness or family emergencies. Late
assignments will be considered when assigning the final grade.
5. Writing Style: The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association
Sixth Edition (APA) is the style manual to be used by all students. The manual is
available at the library or for purchase at the UT Co-op.
6. Use of Canvas: The professor uses Canvas Web-based course
management/collective workspace. An orientation will be given the first day of class.
7. Course Modification: To ensure achievement for course objectives, the professor
reserves the right to make modifications to any part of this syllabus related to schedule
and assignment due dates. Should any modifications be made, students will be notified
in class and modifications will be posted to Canvas. Students should check their
Canvas email frequently. Note that some of the links to documents and videos on the
Internet may change. Documents, new links or alternate options will be provided.
IX.   UNIVERSITY POLICIES
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HONOR CODE. The core values of The University of
Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and
                                                                                            5


responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values
through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
DOCUMENTED DISABILITY STATEMENT. Any student who requires special
accommodations must obtain a letter that documents the disability from the Services for
Students with Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement
(471- 6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). A student
should present the letter to the professor at the beginning of the semester so that
needed accommodations can be discussed and followed. The student should remind
the professor of any testing accommodations no later than five business days before an
exam. For more information, visit: http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/.
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND CIVILITY IN THE CLASSROOM. The professor
expects students to act as professionals in class. This means students should arrive on
time for class, be prepared to participate in the class discussion, and show respect for
one another’s opinions. A course brings together a group of diverse individuals with
various backgrounds. Students are influenced and shaped by such factors as race,
ethnicity, gender, sex, physical abilities, religious and political beliefs, national origins,
and sexual orientations, among others. We expect to learn from each other in an
atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. This atmosphere includes
working intentionally to recognize and dismantle racism, sexism, heterosexism, and
ableism in the classroom. Social Work also deals with complex and controversial
issues. These issues may be challenging and uncomfortable, and it would be
impossible to offer a substantive classroom experience that did not include potentially
difficult conversations relating to challenging issues. In this environment, we will be
exposed to diverse ideas and opinions, and sometimes we will not agree with the ideas
expressed by others. Nevertheless, the professor requires that students engage one
another with civility, respect, and professionalism.
UNANTICIPATED DISTRESS. Students may experience unexpected and/or distressing
reactions to course readings, videos, conversations, and assignments. If so, students
are encouraged to inform the professor. The professor can be responsive and
supportive regarding students’ participation in course assignments and activities, but
students are responsible for communicating clearly what kind of support is desired. If
counseling is needed, students may contact a service provider of their choosing,
including the UT Counseling Center at 512-471-3515 or online
at https://cmhc.utexas.edu/.
POLICY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION. Public social
networks are not private. Even when open only to approved or invited members, users
cannot be certain that privacy will exist among the general membership of sites. If social
work students choose to participate in such forums, please assume that anything
posted can be seen, read, and critiqued. What is said, posted, linked to, commented on,
uploaded, subscribed to, etc., can be accessed and archived, posing potential harm to
professional reputations and prospective careers.
                                                                                               6


Social work students who use social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and
other forms of electronic communication (e.g. blogs) must be mindful of how their
communication may be perceived by clients, colleagues, faculty, and others. Social
work students are expected to make every effort to minimize material which could be
considered inappropriate for a professional social worker in training. Because of this,
social work students are advised to manage security settings at their most private levels
and avoid posting information/photos or using any language that could jeopardize their
professional image.
Students are asked to consider the amount of personal information posted on these
sites and are obliged to block any client access to involvement in the students’ social
networks. Client material should not be referred to in any form of electronic media,
including any information that might lead to the identification of a client or compromise
client confidentiality in any way. Additionally, students must critically evaluate any
material that is posted regarding community agencies and professional relationships, as
certain material could violate the standards set by the School of Social Work, the Texas
Code of Conduct for Social Workers, and/or the NASW Code of Ethics.
Social work students should consider that they will be representing professional social
work practice as well as The University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work
program while in the classroom, the university community, and the broader area
communities.
POLICY ON SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of
failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms
the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic
dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, the student may refer to the
Web Site of the Student Judicial Services, Office of the Dean of
Students: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.
USE OF COURSE MATERIALS. The materials used in this course, including, but not
limited to exams, quizzes, and homework assignments, are copyright protected
works. Any unauthorized duplication of the course materials is a violation of federal law
and may result in disciplinary action being taken against the student. Additionally, the
sharing of course materials without the specific, express approval of the professor may
be a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic
dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action. This sharing includes,
among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of distributing
those materials to other current or future students.
CLASSROOM CONFIDENTIALITY. Information shared in class about agencies,
clients, and personal matters is considered confidential per the NASW Code of Ethics
on educational supervision and is protected by regulations of the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) as well. As such, sharing this information with
individuals outside of the educational context is not permitted. Violations of
                                                                                            7


confidentiality could result in actions taken according to the policies and procedure for
review of academic performance located in sections 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 of the Standards
for Social Work Education.
USE OF E-MAIL FOR OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE TO STUDENTS. Email is
recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, students are
responsible for reading their email for university and course-related information and
announcements. Students are responsible for keeping the university informed about a
change of e-mail address. Students should check their e-mail regularly and frequently—
daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related
communications, some of which may be time-sensitive. Students can find UT Austin’s
policies and instructions for updating their e-mail address
at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS. By UT Austin policy, students must notify the professor of a
pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious
holy day. If the student must miss a class, examination, work assignment, or project in
order to observe a religious holy day, the professor will give the student an opportunity
to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
TITLE IX REPORTING. In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972, the University of Texas at Austin is committed to maintaining a learning
environment that is free from discriminatory conduct on the basis of sex
https://titleix.utexas.edu/. Faculty, field instructors, staff, and/or teaching assistants in
their supervisory roles are mandated reporters of incidents of sex discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual violence, stalking, dating violence, or any other forms of sexual
misconduct. Students who report such incidents will be informed of University
resources. Incidents will be reported to the University’s Title IX Coordinator. Further
information, including student resources related to Title IX, may also be found at
https://titleix.utexas.edu/.
CAMPUS CARRY POLICY. The University’s policy on concealed firearms may be
found here: https://campuscarry.utexas.edu. You also may find this information by
accessing the Quick Links menu on the School’s website.
SAFETY. As part of professional social work education, students may have
assignments that involve working in agency settings and/or the community. As such,
these assignments may present some risks. Sound choices and caution may lower risks
inherent to the profession. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of and adhere to
policies and practices related to agency and/or community safety. Students should
notify the professor regarding any safety concerns.
BEHAVIOR CONCERNS ADVICE LINE (BCAL). If students have concerns about their
behavioral health, or if they are concerned about the behavioral health of someone else,
students may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone their
concerns. This service is provided through a partnership between the Office of the Dean
                                                                                              8


of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee
Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD).

    ·      Familiarize yourself with all exit doors in the classroom and the building.
       Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when
       entering the building.
    ·      If you require assistance to evacuate, inform the professor in writing during
       the first week of class.
    ·      In the event of an evacuation, follow the professor’s instructions.
    ·      Do not re-enter a building unless you are given instructions by the Austin Fire
