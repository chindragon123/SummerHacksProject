performance of these elements using energy and mass conservation models.
2. Understand the physics behind various numerical tools used for solving different heat and
moisture transfer problems in building elements.
3. Use basic numerical methods for solving systems of linear and nonlinear equations.

Personal Problems:
If you have illness or personal problems that will affect your performance during the course of the
semester, please let me know as soon as possible. “After the fact” provides little protection unless
there are extreme circumstances. I have an answering machine and an e-mail address if you need to
get in touch with me after hours. Do not hesitate to use them.
Honor Code:
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold

Policy of Scholastic Dishonesty:
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, visit the Student Judicial
Services web site http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.

Privacy – Web Based Class Sites:
Web-based, password-protected class sites may be associated with all academic courses taught at
the University. Syllabi, handouts, assignments and other resources are types of information that
may be available within these sites. Site activities could include exchanging email, engaging in
class discussions and chats, and exchanging files. In addition, electronic class rosters will be a
component of the sites. Students who do not want their names included in these electronic class
rosters must restrict their directory information in the Office of the Registrar, Main Building, Room
1. For information on restricting directory information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi00-01/app/appc09.html.
Accommodations (Disability Statement):
The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic accommodations
for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Division of Diversity and
Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259 (voice) or 232-2937
(video phone) or http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd.
Dropping the Course:
Undergraduate Students: From the 1st through the 12th class day, an undergraduate student can drop a
course via the web and receive a refund, if eligible. From the 13th through the university’s academic drop
deadline, a student may Q drop a course with approval from the Dean, and departmental advisor.
Graduate Students: From the 1st through the 4th class day, graduate students can drop a course via
the web and receive a refund. During the 5th through 12th class day, graduate students must initiate
drops in the department that offers the course and receive a refund. After the 12th class day, no
refund is given. No class can be added after the 12th class day. From the 13th through the 20th
class day, an automatic Q is assigned with approval from the graduate advisor and the Graduate
Dean. From the 21st class day through the last class day, graduate students can drop a class with
permission from the instructor, graduate advisor, and the Graduate Dean.
Attendance Policy:
Regular attendance and participation are essential and expected. Random attendance will be taken
throughout the semester by various means and it can affect your grade up to 5% (participation
grade). "A student who is absent from a class or examination for the observance of a religious holy
day may complete the work issued within a reasonable time after the absence, if proper notice has
been given". The deadline for notification of such an absence is 14 days prior to the class absence.
Course Evaluations:
Each student will be given the opportunity to evaluate the course ant the instructor using the
standard course/instructor evaluation form at the end of semester.
Quantitative Reasoning:
This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to
equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments you
will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world
problems.
Computer Usage:
Some homework assignments and the term projects will require extensive use of computers. The
students will use the energy and moisture simulation software eQUEST, EnergyPlus, WUFI, etc.
for projects and homework assignments. The software will be installed on computers in ECJ
building, but the eQUEST and EnergyPlus software can be downloaded to personal computers for

free at: http://www.doe2.com/equest/ and http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/. Also,
basic knowledge of any programming language (Matlab, Fortran, C, etc.) is beneficial.
Final Exam:
This course will not have a final exam. The final project and the final project presentation will
replace the final exam.
Projects:
There will be two projects assigned. The midterm projects will count for 10% and final for 30% of
your final grade. Midterm project will be an individual project.
Final Project Description:
It will be a group project where students have a choice to select their project topic in the area of
building energy analysis. Each group will prepare a two page proposal to define the project
objectives, scope, methodology, and deliverables. Students are welcome to propose problems from
their current research or future career. Based on these proposals the course instructor will refine the
final project scope and deliverables for each group, so that each student will have the same final
project work load. Each group member will have the same project grade.
Due Dates Policy:
All assignments are due at the end of the day and those turned in late will count off 10% per day.
