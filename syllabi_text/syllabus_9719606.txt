Prerequisites
This course is intended for incoming graduate students in architectural history, graduate
students in the School of Architecture, and advanced undergraduates in the School of
Architecture. Graduate students from other departments may register with the instructor’s
permission.
Course Description and Format
This course will explore basic models for the writing and research of architectural history and
related fields. We will discuss the evolution of the discipline of architectural history, its
intellectual lineages, major theories of history, and the various methodological models used in
research and writing. Readings and critiques of basic texts will be supplemented with several
short writing assignments. Students will also make in-class presentations during the term. One
longer research paper (approximately 30 pages) will be due on the final day of classes.
Educational Objectives
This course will focus on developing the student’s knowledge of the fundamental problems of
the discipline; on familiarizing her or him with sources and concepts used in architectural history
and theory; on developing her or his critical thinking and writing skills; and on developing her or
his abilities to do scholarly research within the field.
Course Requirements
Class attendance is required. Students will also be required to write several short papers (30%);
participate in class and present their work (30%); and write a final paper (20-25 pages) (40%). Late
papers will not be accepted. A course reader is available at the University Coop. For this course, I
will use plus/minus grading.

• Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
• Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the
first week of class.
• In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.

Conclusion
FINAL PAPERS DUE


                                                                                                        8
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE FOUR SHORT PAPERS
General instructions: For all papers, please use the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians
format for footnote and bibliographical citations. (Refer to the style sheet of the JSAH on the
Society of Architectural Historians website—sah.org). Pay careful attention to the quality of your
writing. Remember: clarity and elegance of expression are important ingredients of any written
presentation! Please no fancy covers or folders! Use plain white paper and staple the pages
together in the upper left corner.
Assignment 1
Building description
(5 pages; plus a bibliography)
Your task is to write a description of Garrison Hall, here on the university campus. Please
consider both the exterior and interior. Use proper architectural terminology. If you are in doubt
about a term, consult one of the many dictionaries of architecture in the library’s reference
collection. Your description should be clear and well organized. In addition, please prepare a
bibliography of at least a page—a little longer if you able to do so.
Assignment 2
Description and analysis of a building's iconography
(5 pages; plus a bibliography)
Select a well-known building and describe and analyze its iconographic program. Be sure to
employ the techniques and approaches you learned from our readings. You should research what
has been written about the building previously, but make sure that your analysis is your own,
not borrowed from another scholar. You may, however, refute or confirm what has been
previously written.
Assignment 3
Book review
(5 pages)
Write a scholarly review of the assigned book. Be sure to engage the question of how biography
is or is not a useful tool in understanding the architect’s works. Evaluate the book. Is the work
successful? Why or why not?
Assignment 4 due
Article review (5 pages)
Write a scholarly article review of one of the four articles listed for this week’s reading. Be sure to
examine what the author’s argument is, her or his methodological approach, and the sources
used. You should also evaluate the quality of the article. How well did each writer answer the
historical questions she or he set out to investigate? Were these the right questions? How might
the article be improved?


                                                                                                   9
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE FINAL PAPER AND ABSTRACT
(25-30 pages plus bibliography, notes, and illustrations)
For your final paper, you are free to choose (after consultation with me!) your own topic. Your
paper may explore a particular building, urban complex, interior, landscape design, or a related
problem (for example, an architectural detail or a theoretical issue). Your work should in some
way examine the general themes of this course: the rise of architectural historiography and/or
the various concepts and problems of theory or practice in the writing of history. You may find it
useful to try to work in some of the theoretical tracts we will be reading, or you may choose to
make use of other texts. Your paper must reflect original research and an original interpretation.
It should not merely be a “report.” To best succeed, you should start early! Papers written at the
last minute always show evidence of the haste with which they were produced. Please follow the
JSAH format for footnote and bibliographical citations precisely!
For the abstract, please supply a one hundred-word summary of your thesis and findings. For
examples, please see the abstracts in JSAH. You will submit a preliminary abstract with your in-
class presentation (instructions for which will be given in class) and a final abstract submitted
with your final paper.
