The University of Texas at Austin has instituted plus/minus grading for graduate students. Department
of Accounting policy requires that a grading scale including pluses and minuses be used for all
graduate accounting classes. University policy continues to prohibit use of plus/minus grading for
undergraduate students. Department of Accounting policy requires that grades for undergraduate
students enrolled in graduate accounting classes will be determined by dropping the plus or minus (if
any) from their letter grade.
EXAMS. The two exams may consist of multiple-choice questions, short answer, and essay problems.
Exams are provided online in Canvas. While students may use their notes and the text book, no
collaboration among students is allowed. You must complete the exam alone. Prepare for the exams
as if they are not open book as you will only have 60 minutes to complete the exams. This will not be
enough time to look up more than just a few of the questions in your notes or in the textbook.
TEAM PROJECT. Students will complete a major field project this semester by working in groups of
three to four, depending on the project scope. The projects will involve actual audit work in a
government agency, company or non-profit organization and will be evaluated as follows:

                                            ACADEMIC HONESTY
Accounting Department Policy:
         The Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
         responsibility of both students and faculty with respect to scholastic dishonesty are described in
         detail in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty in the MPA Program and
         the Professional Program in Accounting. By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all
         of the faculty responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this class, you have
         agreed to observe all of the student responsibilities described in that document. If the
         application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is
         your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
         The student responsibilities embodied in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic
         Dishonesty are consistent with the GSB Honor Code and the University’s General Information
         catalog. However, you should obtain and read the department’s Policy Statement to ensure
         that you understand my responsibilities. Copies are available in CBA 2.302.
Students with Disabilities
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at
471-6259, 471-4641 TTY. If you are in need of an accommodation and have an accommodation
letter, to assure accommodations can be put in place, please visit with me and provide me with the
letter during the first two weeks of the semester.
Class Web Sites and Student Privacy
In Spring 2001, web-based, password-protected class sites became available for all accredited courses
taught at The University. Syllabi, handouts, assignments and other resources are types of information
that may be available within these sites. Site activities could include exchanging e-mail, engaging in
class discussions and chats, and exchanging files. In addition, class e-mail rosters will be a
component of the sites. Students who do not want their names included in these electronic class
rosters must restrict their directory information in the Office of the Registrar, Main Building, Room 1.
For information on restricting directory information see:
http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi05-06/app/appc09.html
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the
date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Campus Safety
Please note the following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office Campus
Safety and Security, (512) 471-5767, utexas.edu/safety/
            Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
             evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
             requires exiting and assembling outside.
            Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
             Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you use when entering the
             building.

           Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform their instructor in writing during
            the first week of class.
           In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
           Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
            Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire prevention
            Services Office.
           Behavior concerns Advice Line (BCAL): (512) 232-5050
    Further information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be
    found at: utexas.edu/emergency.
    Behavioral Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
    BCAL is a service for students, faculty, and staff of the university to discuss their concerns about
    another individual’s behavior. Trained staff members will assist the caller in exploring available
    options and strategies. They will also provide appropriate guidance and resource referrals to
    address the particular situation. Dialing (512) 232-5050 will connect you to trained staff members
    24/7/365. Calls to BCAL can be anonymous, and there is also an on-line reporting form (not
    anonymous).
    Graduate school can be stressful. Lots of help is available at the Counselling and Mental Health
    Center (CMHC). Visit their website at cmhc.utexas.edu or give them a call at (512) 471-3515.
                       Do not hesitate to ask for help – it’s the right thing to do!
