AMS 356/HIS 356K traces the development of American culture and society from the end of the
Civil War to the present. Major themes include racial conflict, pluralism, religion, urban
development, reform, modernism, government centralization, cultural radicalism, and the
rebirth of conservatism. Using a variety of sources and methods, this course explores how
different communities organized around identifiers such as race, ethnicity, national origin, class,
gender, and ideology have negotiated with and contributed to changing conceptions of
American identity.
This course follows a rough chronology of the past 150 years divided into three major sections –
1865 to the early 1920s, the early 1920s to the mid-1960s, and the mid-1960s to the present –
demonstrating great transformations in American society, culture, and everyday life, while also
showing main currents and trajectories regarding individual, communal, and national identities.
The interdisciplinary approach of this course draws upon history, geography, sociology,
literature, popular culture, and other methods of inquiry to reveal a century and a half of
political and social conflicts that complicate narratives of national consensus.
Class format: This is primarily a lecture course but I encourage questions and discussion.
Learning is collaborative!
Requirements: Regular attendance, completion of all reading assignments, three exams.
Goals/outcomes: As members of this intellectual community, you will:
1. Gain a greater understanding of people, groups, events, and ideas since 1865 and how they
have impacted American culture and society in their time and in ours.
2. Engage with a variety of types of texts and evidence to become interdisciplinary interpreters
of American history.
3. Build critical thinking and analysis skills through written expression, including constructing
thesis statements and supporting your argument with evidence from lecture and readings.
Grading:
First exam                       25%    Mon Feb 25 (in class)
Second exam                      30%    Wed Apr 8 (in class)
Final exam                       40%    Day, time, location TBA
Attendance/participation         5%     Assessed at end of the semester


Grading scale: A 93-100; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76; C- 70-72; D+
67-69; D 63-66; D- 60-62; F 0-59
Exam format: The first two exams will be closed book/notes and will contain FIVE (5)
identification questions (choice of 10) and ONE (1) essay question (choice of 2) covering
material from that particular unit. There will be a review session held before each exam. The
final exam schedule and location will be published about a month before the end of the
semester. The final exam will be closed book/notes and will contain EIGHT (8) IDs (choice of 15)
and ONE essay (choice of 2). On the final exam, the IDs will be taken from the last third of the
course but the essay will require you to integrate and synthesize material from the entire
semester to construct your analysis. On all tests, you will be expected to support your essay
answers with evidence from the assigned readings and lectures. For this reason, regular class
attendance is crucial in order to do well in the course. Do not rely on the inevitable Google doc
as a substitute for reading or attending lecture. I do not post lecture slides online.
Make-up policy: Failure to take a scheduled exam without making prior arrangements with
the teaching assistant or me will result in an automatic zero for that exam. I will allow you to
take a make-up exam only in the event of a medical or family emergency, or if you have official,
documented University of Texas at Austin business outside of campus. In both cases, you must
notify the TA or me BEFORE the scheduled exam, unless extraordinary circumstances while
traveling to the exam dictate otherwise, in which case official documentation will still be
required. All make-up exams must be taken within one week of the scheduled exam.
Post-exam protocol: If you would like the TA to review your exam after it has been graded,
please carefully review the comments and wait a minimum of 24 hours before contacting the
TA. Thereafter, make sure to address all questions about your grade within eight days after you
have received your exam back. If you do not reach an understanding with the TA, then I will be
happy to review your exam as well. Please keep your exams as they will help you as you review
for the final exam.
Required readings: All required texts will be in the course reader, available for purchase at
Jenn’s Copies (2518 Guadalupe St). I encourage each of you to be active readers and interact
with the texts by underlining, highlighting, and engaging with the texts as you see fit. Please
show up to class each day ready to discuss the assigned texts.
Attendance: Students are expected to attend class regularly and to participate as best they can
in such a sizable class. Just showing up to class is important but it is not the only factor in
determining a student’s participation. Various aspects of each student’s overall performance
will be taken into account, including attendance, extra credit (if offered), participation in class
discussion, and efforts to communicate with the professor and teaching assistant outside of
class. Attendance will be taken either by a sign-in sheet or by attendance quizzes. Missing an
excess of five class days will result in a zero participation grade. Explained absences for
religious holidays, sanctioned travel related to sports or military service, or other absences you
can plan in advance will not necessarily count against you if at least one week’s notice is given.
Unforeseen absences, such as illness or family emergency, will be excused once proper
documentation is provided, at my discretion. The attendance policy will take effect on Monday,
February 4.


Office hours: I encourage you to come to either my or the TA’s office hours during the semester
so you can get the most out of the course. This is an opportunity for you to discuss exam
expectations, aspects of the lecture material or readings, or just stop by to say hello.
Devices: I strongly suggest that you take notes by hand rather than with a computer or tablet.
Numerous scientific studies have shown that people remember lectures best when they’ve
taken handwritten notes. Laptops and tablets in class must remain silent and may not be used
for any reason other than course-related material (this should go without saying, but no phones
are to be used in class). I trust you to use technology responsibly, but failure to abide by this
policy may result in the revocation of in-class laptop/tablet privileges at my discretion.
Communication: Course-related announcements, relevant or interesting links, potential
changes to the course schedule, and other important information will be posted to the course
Canvas site (and therefore sent to you via email), so please check your email at least once per
day. All emails sent to me will be responded to within 24 hours of receipt unless unforeseen
circumstances arise.
Classroom conduct: This course is built upon discussing topics that are often controversial and
difficult. I encourage all of you to share your informed opinions, feeling, and experiences, and
to engage in conversations that invite productive and respectful disagreement. As such, we all
must maintain respect for the classroom environment and for our colleagues: no name-calling,
slurs, interrupting, or otherwise fashioning a hostile environment. Be willing to have your own
points of view challenged and be willing to respectfully challenge others. The most productive
and exciting intellectual growth emerges from engaging with diverse opinions.
Concealed handgun policy: Per official University of Texas policy, “It is the responsibility of
concealed-carry license holders to carry their handguns on or about their person at all times
while on campus. ‘About’ the person means that a license holder may carry a holstered
handgun in a backpack or handbag, but the backpack or handbag must be close enough that
the license holder can grasp it without materially changing position. The holster must
completely cover the trigger area and have enough tension to keep the gun in place if jostled. A
license holder may not carry a partially or wholly visible handgun on campus premises or on any
university driveway, street, sidewalk, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking area.” With
this in mind, consider that the simplest thing for conceal-carry license holders to do would be to
leave their handgun in a safe, secure location rather than bring it to class.
Cultural Diversity flag: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States.
Cultural Diversity courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness
of the American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your
grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one
U.S. cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalization. This course also fulfills the
history core curriculum requirement.
Students with disabilities: Any student with a documented disability who requires academic
accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259
(voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty members are not required to provide
accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.
Academic honesty: In an effort to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and integrity in the
classroom, cheating and plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. Cheating or plagiarism will


result in an automatic zero for the assignment and will be reported to the Dean of Students.
University policies regarding academic honesty are available at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php
TL;DR version: show up to class consistently, be respectful of each other, put phones away, use
laptops for class-related stuff only, don’t cheat on quizzes or exams.
