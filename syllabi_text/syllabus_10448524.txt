Congratulations on your internship! My role is to support you in getting the most out of this important
experience. To this end, I have identified key assignments to help you in this process (described in detail
on Canvas):
    1) An internship journal that documents the various experiences you’ve gained and contacts made.
        (This might just be an open Word or Google doc that you update weekly.)
    2) Two reflection surveys to formally check in with me throughout the semester.
    3) An internship contract completed at the outset to help clarify specific outcomes and duties.
        Think about deliverables that you’d like to complete and have a discussion about them with your
        supervisor before creating the contract.
    4) An internship evaluation completed (and returned to me) by your supervisor. I hope that your
        supervisor will sit down with you to discuss the evaluation—this is my recommendation.
        However, if s/he fails to do so, I will be happy to share a copy with you at the completion of the
        semester.
    5) A link to the sexual harassment educational module hosted by the University’s Dean of Students.
        This is required in order to sensitize you to this critically important issue. By making it part of our
        conversation, my hope is to remove any reluctance you may have to raise concerns of this
        nature.
    6) A link to the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center’s general questions and answers. This is a
        critical a resource you should use if/when you encounter problems.
In addition to all of the exciting and wonderful experiences students enjoy, I am sensitive to a variety of
challenges that occasionally arise to prevent you from getting as much as possible out of the experience.
Particularly, I am here to protect and help you in navigating your internship. Therefore, I want you to
feel truly comfortable in reaching out to me should you have any questions about the following (or
other concerns that may arise) issues:
    1) Lack of supervision, either through the lack of regular meetings with a supervisor or being given
        assignments without proper guidance or information.
    2) Unreasonable working requests that violate your internship contract, such as number of hours,
        travel, etc.
    3) Sexual harassment, or any uncomfortable or abusive situation.
    4) Anything that concerns you or feels wrong at a gut level.
                                                                                                               1


Course Parameters
    •  If you have difficulties on your internship, be sure to contact me as early as possible. It is
       occasionally necessary for the intern to clarify and assert the conditions of the internship with
       the host organization. I can help guide you in this process.
    •  If you need to consult with me regarding an urgent matter, feel free to call or text my cell phone.
    •  Being fired from an internship position due to performance problems or receiving a poor
       evaluation could result in a failing grade for the course. However, you will not fail the course for
       leaving an internship due to an unsafe or harassing environment. Please contact me as soon as
       possible should you be concerned about abuses of any kind.
    •  This course is web-based. All required course materials (readings, videos, etc.) are available via
       Canvas. Visit canvas.utexas.edu. Sign in to find the course.
Internship Requirements
    • No more than 25% of interns’ time should be spent doing clerical work.
    • The number of hours worked must be commensurate with the College requirements for a 3- or
       6-hr internship.
    • Intern supervisors MUST meet with and work with interns on a regular basis.
    • Intern supervisors MUST complete a contract with the intern near the beginning of the semester
       and an evaluation of the intern’s performance at the end of the semester.
Written Assignments & Surveys
    •  Internship Contract
            o This must be completed (and uploaded) no later than the twelfth class day in order to
               continue in this course.
            o Meet with your supervisor (ideally in person) to clarify your responsibilities, deliverables,
               and evaluation criteria. Use this opportunity to discuss what you hope to learn and what
               experiences you hope to receive during the internship. This document will later be
               helpful if you feel that you aren't getting adequate access to these opportunities. Think of
               the contract as a “values clarification” exercise that ensures your and your employer’s
               needs are being met by being specific and explicit about the work to be carried out.
            o Once you have arrived at a mutual understanding, make sure the contract is completed
               to reflect this agreement and is signed by both of you. Make sure they supply a business
               email and not their personal one.
            o Tip: Provide a copy for yourself and your supervisor to guide the discussion. This could be
               sent ahead via email or handed in person at your meeting.
    •  Internship Journal
            o Keep a daily or weekly journal of your internship experience. This might be a simple open
               Word or Google doc on your desktop or you may choose to purchase a journal or
               notebook solely for this purpose. You will not turn in the journal, but you will use the
               entries to assist you with the assignments (reflection papers and post-internship resume).
               You may also use this as an ongoing record of work experience to help in constructing
               your resume in the future. You’d be surprised at how much you’ll forget in a month or a
               year about the many specific accomplishments that help to develop your resume.
                                                                                                            2


                Remember to address these issues at least each week (if not on a daily basis):
                   ▪ New skills learned
                   ▪ Any training you received
                   ▪ Important work/career contacts made
                   ▪ Projects/activities began and completed
                   ▪ Your enjoyment/dislike/boredom with the industry
                   ▪ Your enjoyment/dislike/boredom at the company
                   ▪ Concerns about or satisfaction level with the internship
                   ▪ Anything else you think is relevant
    •   Midterm and Final Reflection Surveys
            o As you complete these surveys, use your journal to answer the questions in them, and
                check in with me about your progress and experiences on the job.
    •   Internship Evaluation
            o This must be received by me by email from your supervisor (not you). Your supervisor
                must complete, sign and return an Intern Evaluation Form. You can find this form on the
                Canvas website.
            o The evaluation must conform to the following guidelines:
                   ▪ It must be sent directly from your supervisor and signed by that person
                   ▪ It must be sent from a business address (the work email listed on the contract)
                       and include your name in the subject line
                   ▪ It should be in pdf form
                   ▪ It should be emailed to me: laura.brown@austin.utexas.edu
Grading
Only letter grades, not plus/minus increments, are used in this course. Your grade will be determined by
the accumulation of points for course components (see below), not by averages/means. Grades are
determined on a straight percentage scale based on the number of points earned out of a maximum of
100 points. There will be no further rounding or curving of grades. Final grades are calculated as follows:
        A   =      89.5%-100%         (89.5-100 points)
        B   =      79.5%-89.4%        (79.5-89.4 points)
        C   =      69.5%-79.4%        (69.5-79.4 points)
        D   =      59.5%-69.4%        (59.5-69.4 points)
        F   =      below 59.5%        (0-59.5 points)
 Assignment                                             Maximum Points Possible
 Internship Contract                                     20 points

Discussion of Graded Assignments
University procedure for a grade contestation begins with a student and the instructor. A student
wishing to contest a grade must present his/her/their instructor with a typed, well thought out case
regarding the evaluation within one week of having received the evaluation, but not before 24 hours
have passed. The case must be related to the assignment as presented, and based on how it compares
with the criteria for the assignment (not how it compares with someone else’s work or how it will affect
a student’s GPA). Once the student has submitted his/her/their argument to the instructor, the
instructor will respond in writing within 7 days. Student and instructor then may meet to review the
assignment in question, and discuss ways to improve future assignments. Instructors are available for
office hours and can assist you with assignments.
Policies
        Due dates and late work. Assignments turned in after the date and time posted on Canvas are
        considered late. Late assignments will be penalized with a 10% deduction per 24 hours.
        Assignments will not be accepted after one week beyond the due date. If you miss an in-class
        activity for participation points, you will earn a zero (unless you have a university excused
        absence).
        Schedule changes. Changes to the schedule may be made at your instructor’s discretion and if
        circumstances require it. It is your responsibility to note these changes when announced.
        Religious or holy days. A student wishing to observe a religious holy day must notify the
        instructor in writing at least 14 days prior to the classes scheduled on dates the student will be
        absent. For religious holy days that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, notice should
        be given on the first day of the semester. Other absences may be excused according to
        University policy. If you must miss something in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be
        given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
        Accessibility. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute
        that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other
        things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning
        environment including accommodations. The University of Texas at Austin offers support
        services for students with documented disabilities. A student with a disability should inform the
        instructor after requesting an Accommodation Letter from the Services for Students with
        Disabilities Office: 512.471.6259 (phone); ssd@austin.utexas.edu (email). Website:

        Title IX Reporting: Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Senate Bill 212 requires all employees of
        Texas universities, including faculty, to report any information to the Title IX Office regarding
        sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them. Texas
        law requires that all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including,
        but not limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations) must be
        reported. If you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without
        making an official report to the university, please email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more
        information about reporting options and resources, visit http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/, contact
        the Title IX Office via email at titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512-471-0419. Although graduate
        teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Senate Bill 212, they are still mandatory
        reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we
        refer to as sexual misconduct, including the types of sexual misconduct covered under Texas
        Senate Bill 212.The Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to survivors and
        compiled campus resources to support survivors.
