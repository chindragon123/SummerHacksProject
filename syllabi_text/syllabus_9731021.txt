An Intro to the Intro.
What are the elements that make up advertising?
     •    Business.                                                   •   Future-technologies.
     •    Culture.                                                    •   Media.
     •    Anthropology.                                               •   And lots of play money once you start
     •    Data.                                                           playing with the big wigs
Advertising is an art, a science, an invention that stems from creativity. We will address how creativity
compliments the elements that surround advertising. Because one of the biggest myths within advertising is that
all you need is a big creative idea. NOPE! What you need is a big creative idea that solves the challenges of:
     •    Business.                                                   •   Media.
     •    Culture.                                                    •   Having lots of play money once you start
     •    Anthropology.                                                   playing with the big wigs.
     •    Data.
     •    Future-technologies.
Be aware, in this class you will have to roll-up your sleeves and deliver consistent: projects, creative assets and
decks. Why? Because no one gives you a multiple-choice quiz on Madison Avenue.
This class is intended for students who want an understanding of current creative trends and creative school of
thoughts that are impacting the world of advertising.

              Grade              Cutoff

Statement on Learning Success
I want you to succeed in this class. We will all need accommodations because we all learn
differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let
me know as soon as possible. The GA’s and I do not bite. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your
needs and the requirements of the course
Late assignment policy; Time-bank options
All assignments are due by the beginning of class. No late assignments. All late assignments will receive an
automatic zero. All emergency issues should be handled through Student Emergency Services who will, in turn,
contact me.
However, life happens. Sometimes we have bad days, bad weeks, and bad semesters. In an effort to accommodate
any unexpected, unfortunate personal crisis, I have built “time banks” into our course. You do not have to
utilize this policy, but if you find yourself struggling with unexpected personal events, I encourage you to
contact me as soon as possible to notify me that you are using our grace policy. You may use this policy
one of two ways (please choose, and let me know):
• You may have a two-day grace period for one assignment, OR
• You may have 2 one-day extensions for two different assignments.
But if you do not communicate and you are late on an assignment – you get that zero. Don’t be late –
communicate.
YOU CAN NOT USE TIME BANK ON ANY GROUP PROJECT
Makeup policy:
Unless you have accommodations from the University, and we have worked it out together, there is no make-up
assignments or other special accommodations in general. If you are observing a religious holiday, you are still
responsible to turn any work prior to your holiday observance.


Absence Policy:
We are all adults; so, I anticipate for you to attend class. To assure that you are attending, attendance will be taken
in class (beginning or middle or end) through quick 5 -10 mins creative exercises. If you cannot attend due to other
events, your deadline for an excuse absence is 5 days prior to that corresponding class. You are responsible in
gathering assignments, lessons, changed information and meeting with your teams. Every student has 2 excused
absences if notified early. I get it, we all have a life.
Contest policy:
Students have 3 days (72 hours), regardless of holidays or the weekend, to contest a grade from when it is
announced. 72 hours. When contesting you are asking me to review your work once more and like any client, I
have the right to adjust the grade either way. You may when the account or lose the account, defend your work
wisely.
Academic Integrity Policy:
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The
University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.”
Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you
have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to
academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic
Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline,
which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while
you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
UT Policy
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual
assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT
Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms.
When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
     • Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
     • Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become
           involved in a Title IX investigation.
     • Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters,”
which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible
Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one.
Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask


whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without
making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about
reporting options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.

Keep In Mind
UT Creative
The Department of Advertising at The University of Texas at Austin is home to a world-class program for aspiring
copywriters and art directors. Texas Creative graduates can be found working across the nation and around the
globe. The program is a competitive, rigorous, fun, challenging, portfolio-building sequence of classes that can
place you within the epic-center of culture. Near the end of the semester, you’ll be given information on how to
apply. Please note that your idea journal entries are taken into consideration as part of the application process.
Personal Pronouns
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with
differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class
rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless they have added a “preferred name”
with the Gender and Sexuality Center (http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-
resources/). I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the
official roster, and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in
the semester so that I may make appropriate updates to my records.
This Course Has a Writing Flag
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with writing in
an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial
writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have
the opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work.
You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag
classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal
Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
University Resources for Students
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are circumstances
that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information that you need to share
with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am
committed to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your
needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. Any student with a
documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact Services for Students with
Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 512-410-6644 (Video Phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter
outlining authorized accommodations. For more information, visit http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/.
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Need a bit of support. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important
part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic
stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security,
512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire
alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest
exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless
given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or
Fire Prevention Services office.
