Course Description: This course explores the myriad of indigenous languages of the North
America and how they are intertwined with culture. The focus of this course is both descriptive
and anthropological. That is, the indigenous languages of the Americas will be considered with
respect to their phonologies, complex morphologies, discursive structures, and historical
relations as well as their place within the sociocultural milieu of speakers. Language is made
real in use. We will look to the uses and users of language.
Requirements: Each student will lead discussion on a reading at least twice during the
semester (this is dependent on the number of students in the class). A handout covering the
reading should be prepared by the student(s). Each student not presenting that week will turn in
a set of weekly questions on the assigned readings for that week. These weekly questions should
be posted to the class on Canvas by Monday night (so that they are available before class
Tuesday morning). There should be at least 1 (one) question per reading. The questions can
range from the informational to the more theoretical. These questions compose 10% of your
grade.
There are three longer writing assignments. There are two book reviews (15% each). These
should be from 5-7 pages and should both describe and evaluate the work. Comparisons with
class readings when relevant may also be included. The first book review is of Margaret Bender’s
Signs of Cherokee Culture and is due Mar. 26th. The second book review will be chosen by the
student in consultation with Dr. Webster from the list at the end of this syllabus. No students
will review the same book for their second book review. During the final two weeks of class
each student will present a book report in class on the book they have reviewed (15%). The order
will be determined later in the semester. The written review is due May 9th (also 5-7 pages).
There is also a project. This project is inspired by the article by Barbra Meek in week four.
Each student will select a piece of popular culture (a film or television show) and following the
methods described by Meek will analyze that piece for the ways that it represents the ways of
speaking of Native Americans. This analysis should be from 5-10 pages long (15%). It is due Feb.
28th.
I will not accept late assignments. Please do not ask. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
All classes are works in progress, and, if the need arises, the current plans and objectives may
need to be changed to enhance the learning opportunities in the class. This is to be expected and
such changes will be clearly communicated.
