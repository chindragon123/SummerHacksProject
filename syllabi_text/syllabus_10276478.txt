Building America: Engineering Society and Culture, 1868-1980
Why does the built environment matter? What does it tell us about the way society works or the
choices people of past generations made (or failed to make?) What kinds of decisions to planners,
leaders, and people make related to the built environment and how have those decisions influenced
society?
This course will look at roughly 100 years of building in American society from the late 1860s
through approximately 1980. It will focus on the ways in which politicians, architects, engineers,
urban planners, construction workers, naturalists, environmentalists, and others approached the
relationship between large-scale infrastructure projects and social development. It will place such
building projects in larger historical perspective by evaluating key locations and sets of social
relationships (between local, regional and national groups) before and after such projects were built
or expanded. Such projects made the United States into one of the most technologically advanced
nations in the world, promoted higher education, and were even used as models for other nations
around the world.
The class will cover, among other things, the belief systems of the specific engineers who designed
such projects, the entities that commissioned such projects, and the historical context of such
beliefs. It will also explore the responses of those who objected to such projects based on religious,
political, or economic ideologies.
                                                                                                       1


Texts and Readings:
Ted Steinberg, Down to Earth: Nature’s Role in American History (Oxford University Press, 2009).
Henry Petroski, To Engineer is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design (Vintage, 1992).
Documents listed with Course Packet (CP) next to them have been posted on Canvas in the files
section.
On-line readings available on Canvas (sign on with your UTEID first and then you can access the
articles).
Questions to keep in mind when reading: What is the argument of this article/essay? What does the author
say? How do they say it? What is the main topic discussed? Does the author accomplish his/her goals?
Themes and important information:
1) Connections: One objective of the class will be to establish connections between different kinds
of technologies, groups, and innovations. For a sense of what this means, please watch one episode
of Connections with James Burke. You can find these episodes on YouTube or other sources. We will
watch one episode on the first day of class.
2) The relationship between technology and nature. This class will also explore the different
views of technology and nature. There are a number of important debates surrounding both issues:
when is it appropriate to alter nature with technology for human use and when is it inappropriate?
Who gets to make such decisions?
3) Groups and Groupwork Assignments: Over the course of the semester, you will participate in
3 group work activities. You will present on ONE of the three but you will complete all three.
You will be graded on all three. Groups will consist of approximately 6-7 members. You can find
your group assignments on Canvas in the People section. Each member of the group is expected to
participate in the planning and execution of the projects. You will each do research related to your
group’s presentation and you will both create your projects in and present them from software
found at ClioVis.org. The Public Speaking Center can help groups prepare their presentations. You
can find a link to ClioVis on Canvas.
                                                                                                         2


In addition to presenting, on which you will be graded collectively, each group will turn in a
document detailing what each person did. You can do this by simply exporting your timeline
information as a word doc. Make sure each person signs their entries with their initials in the
“reference” section.
Individuals will also grade their fellow group members based on their effort and contributions. You
will receive a group presentation grade (worth 30 points) and an individual grade (worth 15 points)
for these assignments. Your presentation will be worth 45 points. Each in class research project
that you (that you do not present) will be worth another 25 points. You will grade the people in your
group (see assessment in files section of Canvas) and one other group will grade your timeline based
on a very specific rubric (this will also be listed on Canvas). This means that, collectively, the
timelines are worth a total of 95 points.
This is a significant amount of your grade. You will be working in the same group all semester long.
Remember, if one person fails to complete their part, you will get a chance to let us know. Grading
rubrics will be uploaded in the files section of Canvas.
*In-class Group Projects: Presentations should be 6 minutes and 40 seconds long, according
to the Peeka Kucha format. You will answer the questions provided in the prompts on the dates
they are due. We will go over class presentation guidelines and grading in class. Again, you will be
using software designed for this class called ClioVis to create your in-class presentations. You will
build a “webbing” timeline on the software, make connections between events, and then present
directly from the timeline.
The class will ask questions and provide comments on the presentations. This will be part of your
presentation grade.
Class Participation: Students are required to attend class. You should come to class prepared
and ready to speak about the readings, lectures, and issues presented in the course. Students
are expected to participate in both smaller group work and larger class discussions. You will also be
completing a number of “in-class” assignments. Your participation grade will be based on in-class
assignments and your overall engagement with the course.
In class participation grade: Worth 50 points total. There are approximately 28 class days this
semester (class cancellations because of snow days, etc will be taken into account). You get 3
*unexcused absences that you can use over the course of the semester. The mid-term and final
review sessions are optional. That leaves you with approximately 1.5 points possible for each class
11 points possible for participating while in class – that means speaking up in class during general
class discussions, talking with your peers during group work, being prepared, etc. We will take
attendance in the class.
*A note on unexcused absences. You do not have to inform us if you are going to be absent. That
means that if you’re sick, you don’t need to bring me a doctor’s note. Once you miss 3 classes, you
will begin losing points. However, I will take personal emergencies into account.
Students also take two exams: Mid-term Exam and a Final Exam. Each exam will be worth
100 points.
                                                                                                      3


1 Short writing assignment: 3-4 pages. Worth 65 points.
In this assignment, you will pick one large American infrastructure project and place it in historical
context. You will also explore the social and ecological ramifications of this project by asking the
following questions: What connections can we make between this project and social and cultural
changes in society? What connects this project to other technological or scientific discoveries? Is
such a project sustainable?
You must do your own research and use three scholarly sources. Only two of them may be
websites. The other two must be books or journal articles (which you can access through the
library). One of your sources must be a primary source.* You may turn in this paper on EITHER
FEBRUARY__27__ OR APRIL__7__ . You must decide which date you will pick. You may
pick a project we study in class, a project you did research on for a group project, or one we have
not covered.
Criteria: Your project must have been built in America during the years covered in the class. *We
will discuss primary and secondary sources in class. For instance, it could be a skyscraper, a bridge, a
housing project, or a park or some other project.
Quizzes: There may be series of short quizzes given throughout the semester. Most of these will be
fill in the blank quizzes. They are designed to help you grasp the overall chronology of the projects
discussed and their importance to society. Each quiz will be worth 5 points.
Grading:
Students will be graded based on the following percentage scale. Students earning 93% of total
points and above will earn and 93-100 = A 90-92 = A- 87-89 = B+ 83-86 = B 80-82 = B- 77-79 =
C + 73-76 = C 70-72 = C- 67-69 = D+ 63-66 = D 60-62 = D- Below 60: F
THE SYLLABUS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE, CHANGES WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN
CLASS AND CHANGES WILL BE POSTED ON CANVAS.
ACADEMIC HONESTY and PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY: Academic honesty is very
important. You are expected to complete your own work. If you have any questions about academic
guidelines you may call me, 475-7253, or email me at ANY time. You should follow University
guidelines regarding plagiarism and student conduct. For further information see:

Important Notes:
      1. Respect the classroom environment. Turn off or silence your cell-phones while in
          class.
      2. Do not search the web or send text messages while in class unless instructed to do so
          by myself or the TA. You may use your computer in class but if I find anyone in the
          class using their computer for non-class related activities the entire class gets a
          warning. After 3 warnings, the use of computers in the classroom will be prohibited.
      3. Any handouts that you receive from the instructor or teaching assistant should be
          treated as required reading.
                                                                                                       4
