Course Description:
This course builds student confidence in working in and around a theater as a member of a team to
collaborate, problem solve, and complete tasks to meet deadlines. The class will work together to
build, test, install, troubleshoot, and strike integrated media systems for departmental productions in
Theatre and Dance and Arts and Entertainment Technologies. Students will learn how to identify
diﬀerent system components including: data cables, projectors, and video servers and how they are
used. Time will also be spent learning how to use diﬀerent playback software as well as looking at
examples of how the software can be used to program visual eﬀects.
Required Supplies:
You must wear closed-toe shoes that also cover the top of your foot and your heel every day to class.
This is for your safety. You should also wear comfortable clothes that you can move in, climb ladders,
and get dirty. Cell phones are great tools when used appropriately. If the instructor deems a cellphone a
distraction, you will be asked to turn it oﬀ or put it in your bag.
Grading:
You are evaluated on two domains: Punctuality and Participation. Each day the class meets you will
receive 1 point for being on time and 2 points for actively participating. If you have an unexcused
absence you will not receive points for that day. If you are absent 2 days your grade will drop 5%.
Please come to class on time, every day, and ready to participate.
Plus/minus grading will be used:
A       92.5 - 100                                           C       72.5 - 76.49
