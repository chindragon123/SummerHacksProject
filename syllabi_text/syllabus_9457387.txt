COURSE DESCRIPTION
The goals of this course are threefold. First, to analyze the connections between academic and
community-driven solutions to some of today’s most intractable social problems, particularly
those structured by race, gender and class inequality. What role do students and faculty
(especially those in Black studies and related fields) play in relation to such problems? Second,
to serve as an introduction to social movement theory. How have grassroots movements,
particularly within US urban centers, carried-out their visions and strategies for freedom over
the past half-century? Third, to provide AFR majors the opportunity to work collaboratively with
several Austin organizations and agencies that are addressing social justice or pressing issues
and theories discussed throughout the semester. The final goal fulfills the internship
component of the course. *Artwork by Favianna Rodriguez

       •   Please request a meeting with me within the first two weeks of the semester to
           discuss any accommodations.
       •   Please notify me as soon as possible if the material being presented in class is not
           accessible.
       •   Please notify me if any of the physical space is difficult for you.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior
to the date of observance of a religious holy day in writing. If you must miss a class, an
examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will
be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the
absence.
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the
Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you
are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more
information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop .
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
       “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values
       of the University and uphold academic integrity.”
This means that work you produce on assignments, tests and exams is all your own work, unless
it is assigned as group work.
Always cite your sources. If you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have
used in a previous class), you must make that clear, otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism
and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course.
You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty Policy which can be found at

Evacuation Information
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety
and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
when an alarm or alert is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling
outside, unless told otherwise by an official representative.
      • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
           Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
      • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
           week of class.
      • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-
           enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The
           University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
                                                                                                                                     8
