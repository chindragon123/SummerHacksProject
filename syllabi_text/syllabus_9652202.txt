                   NEUROBIOLOGY AND SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE
    I.    Course Description
  This course will cover selected findings from recent neurobiological research as it
  elaborates understanding of relationship dynamics with individuals, couples, families,
  and groups. Although this research is usually found outside the usual discourse of the
  social and psychological sciences, a body of scientific work useful to social service
  providers will be reviewed. The support that recent scientific findings provide for aspects
  of psychological treatment theories and differential diagnosis will be reviewed. This
  course will focus on using multiple perspectives in the advanced application of
  neurobiology research to inform clinical intervention, with emphasis placed at the micro
  and mezzo levels of practice. The framework of the course is based on social work
  values and the ethical decision-making process, as illuminated by the NASW Code of
  Ethics. A bio-psycho-social and cultural emphasis will be applied to the various problem
  areas and disorders covered.
   II.    Course Objectives
  Upon completion of this course, students will demonstrate the ability to:
       a. understand how recent scientific findings guide and inform social service
          interventions;
       b. critically compare and analyze therapeutic and social service implications of
          recent scientific
       c. findings related to the impact of the relationship experiences on/in the human
          brain;
       d. evaluate, select, and design a social service intervention which takes into account
          both the appropriate psychological theory and the scientific research which
          supports the use of that particular theory
       e. adapt social service intervention methods to activities/programs which are
          designed to sensitively
               a. differentiate the needs of the client/client system as influenced by age,
                   gender, sexual orientation,
               b. race, class, ethnic/cultural background, socioeconomic status, physical
                   challenge, and other
               c. individual differences.


III.    Teaching Methods
This course is designed to include a variety of teaching methodologies to achieve the
expectation of student mastery of the skills involved in the examination of social work
practice theory as it is supported by selected scientific findings. Readings, discussion,
lecture, experiential exercise, videos, audio CDs, case examples, and presentations are
designed to enhance the learning experience.

  V.     Class Policies
Students are expected to attend class regularly and to participate in the class discussions
by contributing meaningful questions and discourse with fellow students and the
instructor. Readings are expected to be completed prior to class. Role will be taken;
leaving class at the break will be considered an unexcused absence unless arrangements
have been made with the instructor for the absence to be the excused. Points will be
deducted from the final grade for unexcused absences. The student is allowed one
unexcused absence without penalty. Students will not be permitted to make up work
missed during unexcused absences. Late assignments will not be accepted without
penalty; some exceptions may be made by the instructor. Failure to attend class regularly
and demonstrate through class discussion that one has read the assigned material will be
considered in assigning the final grade. Use of a laptop computer should only pertain to
class and not personal matters/interests.

Student generated handouts:
Text Summary (12% of final grade)
Each student will be required to prepare a written summary of the major points of a
portion of chapters from the texts and provide copies (via email is fine) for fellow
classmates and the instructor (hard copy required). Each emailed summary is due to
fellow students the Sunday before the week the assignment is due and a hard copy to the
instructor the day the assignment is due.
In addition to summarizing the text/articles, each student should choose 3 points they
consider most important, emphasize them in some way in the summaries, and be prepared
to particularly highlight those points in the class discussion.
Presentation to class
Choose two points from your text material and find film example(s) to illustrate it to the
class.
Additionally, each student will create an exercise for the class to illustrate one of the
main “take-home messages” from the material presented. For, example, a role play, a
reading of the text from a case in the Montgomery text, or other creative ways to teach
certain aspects of the material.
Define and give example of a neurobiological concept.
Additionally, each student’s text summary should address both in writing and in class
discussion, the following as it is related to the material summarized:(3%)
    a. see Appendix (pp.279-281 in Schore, text, Affect Regulation and the Repair of the
        Self, 2003, in LRC on reserve) for principles of Regulation Theory
    b. re-state a principle of Regulation Theory which most closely relates to section of
        text summarized and apply to example from film of student’s choosing
    c. speculate on how information in section of text summarized affects or is affected
        by one of the following characteristics: age, class, culture, ethnicity, country of
        origin, language(s), educational attainment, religious background, sexual
        orientation, physical or mental challenge, economic oppression, social oppression.
Note: although the above commentary should be on the summary, this material will not
be reviewed during the presentation.
Article summaries (4% of final grade)
Each student will summarize major points from an article on the syllabus and provide
copies of their notes to fellow classmates and the instructor the Sunday before the week
the assignment is due.


The notes should include the following critical thought:
 (b.) 1 speculation regarding relevant scientific findings that (i.) supports and (ii.) calls
into question the scientific basis of selected principles of the treatment theory in the
article summarized. The scientific findings can be from any of the material in the
textbooks or in classmates summaries (reference this). When the article is discussed in
class, the student is expected to actively support the discussion.
Note: although the above commentary should be on the summary, this material will not
be reviewed during the presentation.
Presentation to class
Choose two points from your article material and find film example(s) to illustrate it to
the class.
For the text and article summaries, create a 6 question “quizlette” for the class to answer
at the end of the presentation. (2 points)
Paper #1,
40% of final grade}: The focus of the examination is the application of selected
neurobiological concepts as related to treatment considerations as well as to evaluate,
select, and design a social service intervention.
The 10 (or so) page paper (excluding bibliography) will be informed by any material
assigned. Additionally, 1 reference should be from the list of suggested texts found at
beginning or syllabus or from the recommended reading list found at the end of the
syllabus; 1 reference from the articles reviewed by students, and also reference your own
article (5 points).
The material will be the case of Karen. The paper should include the following:
    1. (10 points) Make a diagnosis of the client, using DSM 5 format. including codes,
         V,T,Z codes, as appropriate.
         •   List the criteria met by Karen’s symptoms (give examples) and list 5 of the
             defenses that help establish your diagnosis.
         •   For each criteria met and 3 of the defenses employed by Karen,
             speculate on the neuroscience supporting them.
         •   Describe both the behaviors of the speculated attachment category of
             childhood and adulthood and the neuroscience that accounts for the behaviors.
         •   Discuss briefly the attachment category most similar to the
             diagnosis/diagnoses with examples of how it is similar to the diagnosis and to
             the linking neuroscience.
         •   Choose a case from Montgomery text and discuss & give examples of 3
             symptoms, defenses or issues (or some combination) that are similar to
             Karen’s.
                      i.


   2. Give an example of the client’s stressful symptom, memory, wish, experience,
      and/or defensive maneuver and describe principles and/or techniques, and/or
      strategies using Regulation Theory (specify which Principle) could be clinically
      useful in addressing same and explain why the principle would be useful. Mention
      2 neurobiological findings that support the use of this principle/technique to treat
      Karen. (5 points).
   3. Evaluate the above technique’s potential positive and negative effect on the
      treatment issue. For the negative impact aspect of using this technique, design and
      evaluate an appropriate clinical intervention from any other theory that would
      correct the negative impact. Briefly describe and give citation for theory. (5
      points)
   4. Using the dyadic experience between Karen and her therapist, find an example of
      at least 5 of the steps of projective identification. Definition & neurobiology of
      projective identification (include the defenses that are involved in projective
      identification and their definitions, examples, & neurobiology, as well) and
      Schore’s step-by-step description of projective identification, see p. 262 of
      Montgomery text (and the neurobiology of each step, to be in class discussion);
      how is this related to transference/counter/transference, neurobiologically?
      Additionally, choose a case from Montgomery text and speculate on the client’s
      projected material toward the therapist. (10 points)
   5. Give 1 example of the psychological defense of dissociation that was erected in
      the face of therapist intervention (describe intervention and behaviors that suggest
      dissociation occurred), which could include therapist error; define & describe the
      neurobiological underpinnings of the dissociative experience. From the
      Montgomery text, from one of the cases, choose an example of a dissociative
      moment or experience of the client. Speculate on the traumatic reminder that
      prompted the dissociation. (2 points)
   6. Describe an ethical conflict and quote the ethical guideline from NASW Code of
      Ethics that could be a result of the interface between the particulars of the client
      (Karen) and something about you, the student, such as ethnicity, religion, family
      issue, age, gender, sexual orientation, race, class, cultural background, language,
      socioeconomic status, physical challenge, and/or other individual differences;
      speculate on how the interplay you describe between you and Karen could be
      explained neurobiologically. Note: a clinical conflict is not necessarily an ethical
      conflict, though it could be. Additionally, choose a case from the Montgomery
      text with whom you may have a strong reaction(counter-transference) that
      involves something about you, as well. Briefly describe your speculation. (3
      points)
Paper #2: Application of Attachment Theory, Research and the
 Neurobiology of Attachment to a Fictional Character


The clinical data is taken from the “case material” on Suzanne, the character in Postcards
from the Edge. This examination is intended to represent a working draft of a clinical
assessment of the forces that have had an effect on the client’s presenting problem.
Charts or other schematics to present material are acceptable. For each question, use an
article from the Reference list at end of syllabus, the text material, article that you
presented, and/or any material presented by fellow classmates. (2 points)
First ½ of paper
Draft of assessment interviews with client: (#1-4 = 1 point)
    1.   Social Work Setting:
    2.   Referral Source:
    3.   Presenting Problem:
    4.   Identifying data: Create a description of Suzanne from the following list of
         qualities, characteristics and stressors: age, gender, culture, ethnicity, country of
         origin, language, educational attainment, religious background, sexual orientation,
         physical or mental challenge, economic oppression, and social oppression.
         Additionally, describe her general physical and mental health, previous treatment
         (if relevant), employment situation, living situation, relevant relationship issues,
         and other important issues.
    5. (1 point) Mention any three of the above descriptors (question #4) which may
         have an effect on the diagnosis and give neurobiological explanation for why this
         might be so.
    6. (5 points) Make a diagnosis listing criteria met with examples and at least 3
         defenses with examples and the neurobiological description which is the
         mechanism for the criteria and defenses.
    7. (5 points) What may be the neurobiological significance of the diagnosis as it
         relates to the attachment category? Speculate on the childhood and the adult
         attachment category with examples of behavior(s) and note the relationship to the
         Autonomic Nervous System.
    8. (2 points) Give an example of your own right brain reaction to an example of any
         material on this case and explain it from any neurobiological perspective as
         referenced from any principle of Regulation Theory; include countertransference
         challenges as they relate to the therapist’s attachment history and style and
         strategies.
    9. (10.5 points) For projective identification, take the step-by-step
         approach as found in Ch. 8 Montgomery, p. 262 (2013)
         using the argument on the stairs with mother. Describe the
         neurobiological mechanism
         behind each step with examples from scene.


 Second ½ of paper
      10. (4 points) RE: 2nd kissing scene
              § From the encounter between Suzanne and Jack), speculate on the adult
                  attachment category of both people, with some detail.
              § Give a neurobiological explanation for the biology of affect regulation that
                  is implicit in their attachment category.
              § What disowned part of a conflict/ambivalence might each one be likely to
                  project onto the other?
              § Why would each one tend to keep the other side of the
                  conflict/ambivalence (make your best clinical speculation)?
      11. (1 point) Give a neurobiological explanations for the exchange between Suzanne
          and Doris when Suzanne comes in late one night. Give some dialogue, such as,
          “Do you mind if I drink?...Do you mind if I drop acid? Or “I hardly think that my
          drinking can be compared with your drug taking” in order to illustrate the
          neurobiology implicit in the encounter.
      12. (1 point) From the Evelyn Ames conversation, “I’m in it for the endolphin
          rush…”Describe and explain Suzanne’s reaction (from neurobiological
          perspective) at any point in the conversation.
      13. (1 point) Using the neurobiological information regarding the shame experience,
          explain Jack and Suzannes’ reactions during their argument (e.g., “You know
          what this is, it’s a jealous tantrum….” Or any other interactions or dialogue
          within that argument).

VIII.     UNIVERSITY POLICIES


THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HONOR CODE. The core values of The University of
Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and
responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through
integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND CIVILITY IN THE CLASSROOM. The professor
expects students to act as professionals in class. This means students should arrive on
time for class, be prepared to participate in the class discussion, and show respect for one
another’s opinions. A course brings together a group of diverse individuals with various
backgrounds. Students are influenced and shaped by such factors as ethnicity, gender,
sex, physical abilities, religious and political beliefs, national origins, and sexual
orientations, among others. We expect to learn from each other in an atmosphere of
positive engagement and mutual respect. Social Work also deals with complex and
controversial issues. These issues may be challenging and uncomfortable, and it would be
impossible to offer a substantive classroom experience that did not include potentially
difficult conversations relating to challenging issues. In this environment we will be
exposed to diverse ideas and opinions, and sometimes we will not agree with the ideas
expressed by others. Nevertheless, the professor requires that students engage one
another with civility, respect, and professionalism.
UNANTICIPATED DISTRESS. Students may experience unexpected and/or distressing
reactions to course readings, videos, conversations, and assignments. If so, students are
encouraged to inform the professor. The professor can be responsive and supportive
regarding students’ participation in course assignments and activities, but students are
responsible for communicating clearly what kind of support is desired. If counseling is
needed, students may contact a service provider of their choosing, including the UT
Counseling Center at 512-471-3515 or online at https://cmhc.utexas.edu/.
POLICY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION. Public
social networks are not private. Even when open only to approved or invited members,
users cannot be certain that privacy will exist among the general membership of sites. If
social work students choose to participate in such forums, please assume that anything
posted can be seen, read, and critiqued. What is said, posted, linked to, commented on,
uploaded, subscribed to, etc., can be accessed and archived, posing potential harm to
professional reputations and prospective careers.
Social work students who use social media (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and other forms
of electronic communication (i.e. blogs, etc.) must be mindful of how their
communication may be perceived by clients, colleagues, faculty, and others. Social work
students are expected to make every effort to minimize material which could be
considered inappropriate for a professional social worker in training. Because of this,
social work students are advised to manage security settings at their most private levels
and avoid posting information/photos or using any language that could jeopardize their
professional image.


Students are asked to consider the amount of personal information posted on these sites
and are obliged to block any client access to involvement in the students’ social networks.
Client material should not be referred to in any form of electronic media, including any
information that might lead to the identification of a client or compromise client
confidentiality in any way. Additionally, students must critically evaluate any material
that is posted regarding community agencies and professional relationships, as certain
material could violate the standards set by the Steve Hicks School of Social Work, the
Texas Code of Conduct for Social Workers, and/or the NASW Code of Ethics.
Social work students should consider that they will be representing professional social
work practice as well as The University of Texas at Austin Steve Hicks School of Social
Work program while in the classroom, the university community, and the broader area
communities.
POLICY ON SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of
failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms
the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic
dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, the student may refer to the
Web Site of the Student Judicial Services, Office of the Dean of Students:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.
USE OF COURSE MATERIALS. The materials used in this course, including, but not
limited to exams, quizzes, and homework assignments, are copyright protected works.
Any unauthorized duplication of the course materials is a violation of federal law and
may result in disciplinary action being taken against the student. Additionally, the sharing
of course materials without the specific, express approval of the professor may be a
violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty,
which could result in further disciplinary action. This sharing includes, among other
things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of distributing those
materials to other current or future students.
DOCUMENTED DISABILITY STATEMENT. Any student who requires special
accommodations must obtain a letter that documents the disability from the Services for
Students with Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement
(471- 6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). A student
should present the letter to the professor at the beginning of the semester so that needed
accommodations can be discussed and followed. The student should remind the professor
of any testing accommodations no later than five business days before an exam. For more
information, visit: http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/.
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS. By UT Austin policy, students must notify the professor of a
pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy
day. If the student must miss a class, examination, work assignment, or project in order to
observe a religious holy day, the professor will give the student an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.


TITLE IX REPORTING. In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972, the University of Texas at Austin is committed to maintaining a learning
environment that is free from discriminatory conduct based on gender. Faculty,
instructors, agency-based field instructors, staff, and/or teaching assistants in their
supervisory roles are mandated reporters of incidents of sex discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual violence, or sexual misconduct. Students who report such incidents
will be informed of University resources. Incidents will be reported to the University’s
Title IX Coordinator and/or the Title IX Deputy for the SSW, Professor Tanya Voss.
Students, faculty and staff may contact Professor Voss to report incidents or to obtain
information. Further information, including student resources related to Title IX, may
also be found at http://socialwork.utexas.edu/dl/files/academic-programs/other/qrg-
sexualharassment.pdf.
CAMPUS CARRY POLICY. The University’s policy on concealed fire arms may be
found here: https://campuscarry.utexas.edu. You also may find this information by
accessing the Quick Links menu on the School’s website.
CLASSROOM CONFIDENTIALITY. Information shared in class about agencies,
clients, and personal matters is considered confidential per the NASW Code of Ethics on
educational supervision and is protected by regulations of the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act (FERPA) as well. As such, sharing this information with individuals
outside of the educational context is not permitted. Violations of confidentiality could
result in actions taken according to the policies and procedure for review of academic
performance located in sections 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 of the Standards for Social Work
Education.
USE OF E-MAIL FOR OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE TO STUDENTS. Email is
recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, students are
responsible for reading their email for university and course-related information and
announcements. Students are responsible for keeping the university informed about a
change of e-mail address. Students should check their e-mail regularly and frequently—
daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related
communications, some of which may be time-sensitive. Students can find UT Austin’s
policies     and     instructions     for    updating      their   e-mail     address    at
https//cio.utexas.edu/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy.
SAFETY. As part of professional social work education, students may have assignments
that involve working in agency settings and/or the community. As such, these
assignments may present some risks. Sound choices and caution may lower risks inherent
to the profession. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of and adhere to policies
and practices related to agency and/or community safety. Students should notify the
professor regarding any safety concerns.
BEHAVIOR CONCERNS ADVICE LINE (BCAL). If students are worried about
someone who is acting differently, they may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to


 discuss by phone their concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is
 provided through a partnership between the Office of the Dean of Students, the
 Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program
