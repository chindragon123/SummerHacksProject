Course Description:
From presentations to content to case-study videos, today’s brand communicators must know how to create
persuasive pieces, using a variety of digital software tools. This course introduces all students to the
fundamentals of good graphic design, as well as production basics. Students will then build their digital design
skills using industry-standard software, from print to motion and interactive. Assumes no prior knowledge.

Course Outcomes:
By the end of this course, you should demonstrate an understanding of:
  1. Adobe CC Skills: Ability to use various Adobe professional-level applications to create brand messages.
  2. Craft: How well a message is conceptualized, designed, and constructed digitally.
  3. Visual Communication: Understanding how we communicate visually, in static, motion, and interactive
       media.
Coursework.
You'll be assigned various projects to learn the theoretical fundamentals as well as practical skills of designing
and producing work using various Adobe CC programs. Each course section includes small projects, quizzes,
and a capstone Major Project to demonstrate both your theoretical and hands-on skills. Minor Daily Projects
are simple hands-on projects, quizzes, and video lessons that are graded on a simple 3-point scale. Major
projects allow you more freedom to demonstrate your growing design skills, carry more grade weight, and are
graded more subjectively. (In other words, your creative decisions play a bigger role in this grade, and sheer
amount of work put into a project does not always correlate with the final creative output. This is ultimately a
design-oriented class, and there aren't always clear "right or wrong" answers--only better or weaker creative
solutions.)
Grades.
Here’s how your final course grade will be calculated:
40% = 2 Major Projects (20% each; graded)
60% = 23 Daily Projects (most class days; 3% each; lowest 3 grades dropped)
Final letter grades are calculated according to these cutoffs—no exceptions:
A = 94 to 100 A- = 90 to <94 B+ = 87 to <90 B = 87 to <84 B- = 84 to <80 C+ = 80 to <77 C = 77 to <74
 C- = 74 to <70 D+ = 70 to <67 D = 67 to <64 D- = 64 to <61 F = 61 to 0
Policies:
Late Work
As a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry, you are expected to complete every project on time –
no exceptions. All projects are due on Canvas at the date and time indicated on the Class Calendar.
Emergencies happen, so you are allowed one “Late Pass” without penalty, which gives you an additional 2
days (48 hours) to complete a single Major Project. (There is no Late Pass for Daily Projects--your two
lowest grades will be dropped.) Once you use your Late Pass, you will not be able to turn in any late projects
under any circumstances, unless you already have a prior exemption for a Religious Holy Day, a school-
sponsored trip, or a doctor's note, obituary, or other issue that you can document with a written excuse.
