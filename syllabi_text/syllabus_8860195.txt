course objectives.
Sure, I could get all business buzzwordy about what you’re here to do. I could talk about how you’re
going to “work synergistically as a single unit to effectively communicate a brand message and increase
the conversion of a given target market.” But I won’t. Well, not beyond that last bit. We all know what
this class is about. This is where you take everything you’ve learned in your time here here at UT and put
it together for one, single, noble purpose - to take over the wor...ahem, to win a client’s business. You’ll
get to know a real world client, do your research, discover the issue/problem/opportunity, do more
research, figure out a plan, execute that plan, and then try to convince that client that you’re right and
everyone else has no idea what they’re talking about. Like picking up a new friend at a bar, only with a
bigger budget and less risk of getting alcohol thrown in your face. Oh, and you’ll do it as a team,
because that’s what we do in the real world. For realsies.
You’ll spend 5 weeks working to prepare and deliver a single campaign idea. That’s right, all the eggs
are in one basket. In the end you’re to deliver a planbook and presentation that convinces me and the
client that you’re the best and we’d be crazy not to hand over our money to you on the spot. Simple. Did
I mention you’ll be competing with other teams? Well, now I have. Yup, the team whose campaign is
chosen will lead the way for the other teams in the execution phase.
Once the client is on board you will execute your stuff, run your stuff out in the real world, analyze the
results, and explain what went right and what went wrong. It’s a whole campaign from start to finish
jam-packed into a single semester.
things to focus on. (worth coming back to a few times, I’d wager)
     -   Teamwork​: I’m talking ‘80s montage, guitar solo, best buds getting together to get it done kinda
         teamwork. No loners. No “I do this, you do that and we’ll cram it together in the end”. I want you
         all talking, exchanging ideas, building each other up and discovering new territory. Meet every
         day. Trust me on this. Work as a real team, in real time, in person if possible.
     -   Good ideas​: What do I mean “good”? It’s unique, conceptual, solves the problem, engages the
         customer, talks “with” not “at”, has legs that take it into all known media (and some unknown),
         and above all DOESN’T BORE THE PANTS OFF ME. Oh, and not just two or three of these


         things. All of them. If it’s been done before, don’t do it. I don’t want well-researched advertising
         wallpaper here. You’ve turned in boring papers already. Now do something you’re proud of.
     -   Research and proof​: Don’t just tell your idea, sell it. Your idea may be amazingly funny or it may
         move a client to tears, but you still have to convince them it’s the right way to go. If they’re
         gonna spend money with you then they want to know they’re getting a solid ROI. They won’t just
         take your word for it. Have a rationale and show it.
     -   Trust​: Does the client trust you and your team with their future? Why should they? Earn that
         trust. Don’t misspell a single word. Don’t use outdated research. Prove to them you know their
         business and above all make them like you. Yeah, go figure. They’re human beings and
         emotional connections are important. Make them like you and they’ll like your idea just a bit
         more. Make them think you’re a tool and it doesn’t matter how good your idea is.

All the books you’ve read for all your classes previous to this. I’m not kidding. Read them again. Ask
your group members if they’ve read different books and read those too. Life (and this class) is about
connecting dots and the more dots you have the better chance you have at doing something amazing.
