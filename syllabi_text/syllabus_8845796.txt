Course Description
        This upper division undergraduate course introduces students to some of the
major theories and topics in the post-Cold War international relations of the Asia Pacific.
We begin by analyzing and assessing liberal institutionalist, realist and constructivist
interpretations of international relations in the region, and then explore the institutional
foundations of and recent changes in the postwar U.S.-Japan economic and security
relationship and Japan’s expanding leadership role in Asia. We then move on to the rise
of China and its implications for U.S. power in the region, Taiwan’s de facto
independence, and the fate of internationally-contested islands in Asian waters. After a
brief look at the changing politics of Myanmar (Burma) and their significance for great
power relations in the region, we conclude the semester with an in-depth look at recent
developments on the Korean peninsula and the impact of recent North Korean economic
and military changes on U.S. foreign policy. We will analyze these and related topics
from theoretical, historical and comparative perspectives, and through a variety of
pedagogical approaches: lectures, class discussions/debates, films, and analysis of current
events. It is my hope that by the end of the semester, students will have acquired not only
a strong grounding in the facts of international relations in this important region of the
world, but also a deep appreciation of the values and assumptions that inform various
interpretations of the significance of those facts.
        This course carries the “Global Cultures Flag,” which means it is designed to
increase student familiarity with cultural groups outside the U.S. Accordingly, we will
pay close attention to the cultural and institutional foundations of international relations
in the region, and with reference to comparable Western experiences.
Prerequisites
        Six hours of lower division Government credit. No prior knowledge of Asia is
required. Graduate students may take this course for graduate credit.

The presentations are designed to provide you with rough outlines of basic concepts and
themes. To do well on exams, you must attend class regularly and take detailed notes
