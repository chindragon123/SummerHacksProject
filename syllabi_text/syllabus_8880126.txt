INTRODUCTION This course is designed as an introduction to the field of physical anthropology. During
the semester you will investigate numerous and diverse subjects including modern evolutionary theory, sexual
reproduction, human genetics, biological variation in populations of modern humans, mammalian phylogeny,
primate diversity, behavior, biology, and ecology, the fossil record of primate and human evolution, and
archaeology. The diversity of these topics will illustrate how the topics of physical anthropology are integrated
and offer you an understanding of the place of humans in the world.
All exams and labs are completed in the Computer Testing Lab in SAC 5.112.
COURSE POLICY ON ACADEMIC HONESTY Students who cheat not only cheat themselves but
also other students and harm the reputation of the University. Any student found cheating (see below) will
receive an automatic F in the course, and their case will be directed to the appropriate University authorities
for additional sanctions that may include dismissal from the University. Please see the UT Honor Code.
Students ARE NOT permitted to copy or reproduce by any means (e.g., photograph, etc.) the exam
questions, ARE NOT permitted to copy or reproduce by any means the answers to the exam questions,
and ARE NOT permitted share with or ask other students any information about the exams. Students
ARE NOT permitted to discuss the content of the exams with each other, and this includes all possible
venues (informal hallway chat, websites, forums, Facebook, TM, etc.).
Students ARE NOT permitted to discuss or share laboratory assignments and answers with another
student(s) or ask other students for answers, ARE NOT permitted to collaborate on the completion of lab
assignments, and ARE NOT permitted to submit lab assignments for each another.
A student(s) who requests any exam or lab information from another student puts the other student(s) in
the course at risk and s/he will receive an F in the course even if no information is supplied by other
student(s).
This course has a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for cheating. Any questions about the lab assignments and
exams should be directed to the professor and teaching assistants, NOT to your fellow students.
                                                           1


GENERAL REQUIREMENTS There are no formal meetings for this course. Therefore, to
successfully complete the course, the student must be able to learn the material without the benefit of
lectures and formal laboratories. Students are responsible for setting their own proper study pace for the
course, but must comply with due dates for the exams and assignments. This class is not less time consuming
than other classes, but it provides the student with broad latitude in arranging their study and testing schedule.
The course may be completed before the end of the semester by working in a more concentrated manner and
testing before the due dates. Any student who does not complete an exam(s) and lab assignment(s) by the due
dates will receive zeros.
All work submitted in this course must be that of each individual student. Students ARE NOT permitted to
collaborate in the completion of laboratory assignments by discussing questions or sharing answers, nor are they
permitted to assist each other by discussing questions or sharing questions and answers from the exams. Any
violation of this policy will be treated as cheating and the offender will receive an F in the course. The offender
will be referred to UT’s office of student judicial services for investigation and further disciplinary action.
Students will be required to sign an Academic Honesty Policy Compliance statement at the beginning of the
semester which states that they agree to follow these rules and that they understand that any violation of the
Policy will result in an F for the course and additional academic sanctions including possible dismissal from the
University.
REQUIRED TEXTBOOKS The following materials are required for the course and are supplied as a
shrink-wrapped bundle in order to reduce the overall costs of the materials:
•Essentials of Physical Anthropology, Jurmain, Kilgore, & Trevathan, 2013, 10th edition. NOTE: the title and
cover of the 3-ring binder version of the book for this course are different from the book that is sometimes used
for the lecture version of Ant 301. Be sure to purchase the correct book!
•Virtual Laboratories for Physical Anthropology, Kappelman, 2007, Version 4. Labs are hosted on-line
through UT Box and access is purchased through the TXShop website: Virtual Labs access purchase page
COURSE WEBSITE Go to UT’s Canvas Course Website. The website will aid you in completing the
course. It is strongly suggested that you visit the site frequently and at least weekly to view any announcements
posted to the bulletin board. In addition to the complete syllabus, the website contains links to interesting sites
related to physical anthropology. Most importantly, the class website provides the Virtual Lab assignments.
EXAM AND LAB REQUIREMENTS The requirements for this class include:
     1) You must present your UT ID card before you can test or submit labs. No other ID is accepted
         (e.g., driver’s license), and you will not be permitted to test without your valid UT ID card.
     2) All students are required to take a compliance exam that evaluates their understanding of course
         policies as presented in the syllabus and must earn a score of 100% before they are permitted to
         continue with the course.
     3) Ten computer-generated exams based on readings from the textbook, Essentials of Physical
         Anthropology. You are permitted two attempts on each of the ten exams, with the higher of the two
         scores counting as the grade. All exams are completed in the Computer Testing Lab (SAC 5.112).
         Sign-up sheets for reserving testing times are available on a bulletin board outside the testing lab (SAC
         5.112). You must present your UT ID card before you can test. There are DEADLINE DUE
         DATES for these exams. Please see page 3 of this syllabus for exam deadlines.
     4) Twelve lab assignments are based on the Virtual Laboratories for Physical Anthropology. Again, these
         assignments have DEADLINE DUE DATES. Deadline dates are staged on Tue and Wed according
         to the student’s last name in order to reduce lab congestion. Each assignment is completed by
         accessing the Virtual Labs program through the UT Box website and working through each of the 12
         labs. You next download each assignment from the Canvas course website, answer the questions, and
                                                            2


     bring your answers to the Computer Testing Lab (SAC 5.112) and enter your answers during REVIEW
     HOURS only. You must present your UT ID card before you can enter your answers. See page 3 of
     this syllabus for lab deadline dates, and page 5 for detailed lab submission instructions.
  5) Students must complete a “Check Status” four times during the semester. Check Status is completed in
     the computer testing lab and shows your progress and grade(s) in the course up to that date. You may
     Check Status as frequently as you like, but you are required to do so at least four times throughout the
     semester. See the table below for the Check Status due dates. As with exams and laboratories, you do
     not have to Check Status on the exact due dates listed below, but must do so at least once by each of
     those dates.
                            The testing lab opens on 4 September 2018

EXAMS Exams are based on information from the Jurmain et al. textbook. Be sure to read all of the
material carefully, including figures and the “boxes” which highlight certain important historical and scientific
events. In order to answer some of the multiple-choice questions, you may be required to work Punnett squares
(Mendelian genetics), complete phylogenies and timelines, and identify bones and features in figures and plots.
A WORD OF CAUTION: Exam deadlines are Fridays. Whenever possible, it is best to complete testing early in
the week before the Friday deadline because of potential overcrowding on Fridays. YOU MUST RESERVE A
TESTING TIME SLOT IN ADVANCE OF WHEN THE TESTING LAB OPENS TO BE PERMITTED TO
COMPLETE AN EXAM ON FRIDAY. In addition, if you wait until the deadline day of Friday to test for your
first attempt, you will only be allowed ONE opportunity to complete the exam – one test only on Friday.
                      EXAMS MUST BE TAKEN IN NUMERICAL ORDER!
                      Exam 1 = chapters 1 and 2             Exam 6 = chapter 9
                      Exam 2 = chapters 3 and 4             Exam 7 = chapter 10
                      Exam 3 = chapter 5                    Exam 8 = chapter 11
                      Exam 4 = chapters 6 and 7             Exam 9 = chapters 12 and 13
                      Exam 5 = chapter 8                    Exam 10 = chapter 14
             Chapter numbers are from the Jurmain et al. textbook (2013) 10th edition as noted above.
You must have your UT student ID card or UT Virtual ID to test, and no exams will be given to students
without a valid UT ID. You must sign in, and your ID card will be checked and left with the TA during the
exam. Studying is not allowed in the testing room. Books, notebooks, and electronic devices are not permitted
in the testing area (cell phones have to remain in pockets, backpacks or purses), and students are not permitted
to copy down any questions or answers from the exams. The TA will provide scratch paper if needed to work
any problems, but the scratch paper must be returned to the TA when the student finishes the exam. Exams are
taken on computers in SAC 5.112 during posted testing hours only.
You should sign-up for tests on the sheets posted on the bulletin board outside SAC 5.112 if you wish to reserve
a computer for a specific testing time. A second test is permitted on the same day but must be separated
from the first attempt by an exam review period. However, two attempts ARE NOT permitted on Friday
(deadline day). Students who reserve testing slots receive priority for that testing time over walk-in students.
This is an especially important distinction on deadline days because no walk-ins are allowed during Friday
testing hours. Only students who sign up in advance before the testing lab opens on Friday will be allowed
to test during Friday testing hours. In order to expedite your time, it is also strongly recommended that you
sign up for testing times on other days of the week.
Since exams take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete, the last login time for an exam is fifteen
minutes before the end of each testing period. There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule; do not come by 5
minutes before the end of the testing period and expect to test – you will not be seated for an exam. It is in
your best interest to plan out a weekly schedule and stick to it. We cannot reschedule testing times if the
testing periods conflict with your classes. If you have scheduling conflicts with the testing times given below,
you need to 1) drop the course that conflicts with this course, 2) drop this course, or 3) rearrange your
work/course schedule.
BEGIN TESTING EARLY in the week and keep a cushion of time between the deadlines if you want to take
advantage of testing flexibility. You will receive a grade of zero for any exam that you have not taken.
EXAM SCORING: Each exam is composed of 15 questions worth 1 point each for a maximum score of 15.
You may retake each exam once, and the higher of the two scores will be counted toward your grade. No two
exams are identical because the questions in each exam are randomly selected from a large pool of possible
questions. There is, therefore, no advantage to taking an exam without studying with the intention of previewing
                                                          4


the questions before trying a second “serious” attempt. Exams are scored and the results are reported to you and
recorded by the computer immediately upon completion of each exam. You are strongly encouraged to record
your exam scores in the "Record Keeping" section at the end of this syllabus for your own information.
EXAM SECOND ATTEMPT: If you choose to take an exam twice, both attempts must be completed by the
exam deadline, and the highest score of the two attempts will be counted as the grade. Both attempts of the exam
must be completed before you can move on to the next exam because all exams must be completed in numerical
order. If you wait until the deadline day to complete the second attempt, be sure to sign up for a testing slot. You
can heck the reservation sheets posted outside SAC 5.112 for computer availability. SIGN UP EARLY!
EXAM REVIEW PROGRAM: You can use the exam review program to review the results of your exam. It is
strongly recommended that you review your first exam before you take the second attempt, and you can only do
this during Review Hours. You are permitted to review one time only and are limited to 15 minutes.
EXAM DEADLINES: Be sure to note the “DEADLINE DATE” column in the table on page 3 above. It is
NOT possible to take an exam after the deadline, other than in exceptional cases documented by an approved
extension request (see page 7). Possible excuses are detailed at the end of this syllabus. The extension request
form and documentation must be received no later than 1 week after the missed exam or lab assignment.
The last page of the syllabus lists the Deadline Dates for the Exams, Labs, and Check Status that
you can post on the wall above your desk!
VIRTUAL LABS The Virtual Laboratories are accessed through a link hosted on UT Box, access to which
is purchased from the TXShop website ($45). (Please note: the older Cengage access codes, which can
sometimes be found for sale on EBay, Amazon, and similar websites, will not work since the program has now
been migrated to a UT server.) Each lab requires about 30-60 minutes to complete and can be worked through as
many times as you wish. Students are encouraged to take notes while they are working on the Virtual Labs. This
website works with both Windows and Apple platforms. However, the program requires Firefox, Safari, or
Internet Explorer web browsers, so unfortunately it will not work on Google Chromebooks.
Exact instructions for accessing the Virtual Labs program are provided on the Canvas course website.
VIRTUAL LAB ASSIGNMENTS on the Canvas course website: The lab assignments are downloaded from
the Canvas course website and consist of a series of questions that can be answered as you work through the
different sections of each of the 12 Virtual Labs. These exercises should be treated as open book assignments
but you must complete the work on your own without assistance from other students. They are completed in the
following manner:
     1. Download the lab assignments onto your hard drive from the Canvas course website. The assignments
         for each lab are in the “pdf” file format. It is probably easiest to print out a copy of the assignment and
         use the hardcopy to record your answers to questions as you work through the lab.
     2. As you work through each Virtual Lab, be sure to read all the various sections, navigate through all of
         the pages, view the video clips and animations, and complete the Virtual Lab exercises and brief
         quizzes. While working through each Virtual Lab, you will encounter information regarding the
         questions on the lab assignment that you have downloaded from the course website (item #1 above), and
         you can answer them at this time. (You will find all of the answers to the questions in the Virtual Lab.)
         Once you have completed the lab and answered all of the questions on the downloaded hardcopy
         assignment, you should double-check all of your answers for correctness.
     3. Be sure to save the hard copy of your completed assignment for each particular Virtual Laboratory.
You are now ready to begin submitting your lab assignments. You are permitted ONE submission only
for each lab. The computer system logs the number of attempts and alerts the TA to multiple submissions.
If a student submits lab answers more than once, they will be caught and will receive an F in the course.
                                                             5


     1. Bring your UT ID card and the hardcopy of your completed lab assignment to the Computer Testing
         Lab (SAC 5.112) during REVIEW HOURS only. You must arrive at least 15 minutes prior to the end
         of a review block in order to be seated (see page 4)
     2. Sign into the testing lab to submit your lab. Only one lab can be queued for entry at a time.
     3. Take the hardcopy of your Virtual Lab completed assignment to the computer station and enter your
         answers into the lab assignment computer testing program. When you have completed the answer entry,
         you can leave the testing station.
     4. You next collect your ID card from the TA. Be sure that your name and UTEID are on your hardcopy
         assignment and turn the hardcopy assignment in to the TA.
     5. If you wish to submit a second or third (or more) lab, you must complete the sign-in process to re-enter
         the queue, and this means going back into the line. If you plan on submitting more than one lab, be sure
         to budget adequate time for the task.
Unlike exams, answers to your lab assignments can only be submitted once. All lab assignments are also
subject to a calendar of deadline dates and must be completed in numerical order. Lab Assignments total 12 in
number are worth 5 points each, for a total of 60 points.
The due dates for the Lab Assignments are on page 3. They are staged across Tu and Wed in alphabetical
order, and alternate by last name. Students are, however, strongly encouraged to submit their answers to their
completed lab assignments well before the due date. If a student waits until the due date, it is possible that s/he
will experience difficulties accessing the testing lab. Assignments not completed by its due date will receive a
grade of zero.
TESTING AND REVIEW HOURS Exams and exam reviews are given in 15-minute blocks in SAC
5.112. You are permitted to review each exam one time only with a 15-minute time limit. You must log into the
lab at least 15 minutes before the end of review session.

EXAM REVIEW AND TA CONSULTATION: Depending upon the number of questions missed in your first
attempt to pass an exam, the Exam Review program can take from 5 to 10 minutes to complete. The review is
given in the testing room, SAC 5.112 during review hours only. You are permitted to review each exam one
time only with a 15-minute time limit. Any questions you have about material in the textbook or Virtual Lab
can be answered by one of the TAs during the review hours or by the professor during office hours.
CHANGES IN TEST SCHEDULE: Any changes in scheduling will be posted on the bulletin board outside
SAC 5.112 and to the Bulletin Board on the course website. You will likely also receive an email about any
changes. You are strongly encouraged to check these two bulletin boards as least weekly. In addition, there is a
sign-up sheet for testing times on the bulletin board outside the testing room. You are encouraged to sign up for
testing times well in advance of the day that you wish to test. If you wait until the week or day of an exam
deadline, you may find that few testing slots are available. There is no online sign-up sheet.
GRADING Your course grade is determined by summing your exam and lab scores. When an exam is taken
twice, the higher of the two scores is counted toward the course grade. Grades are assigned as whole letter only
(no +/-).
                                                          6


Grade are determined by your cumulative point total (150 possible points for the exams, and 60 possible points
for the Virtual Lab assignments, for a total of 210 possible points). A pass/fail grade must have 125 points or
more to earn a “pass.” When calculating the letter grade, we follow this commonly used rounding rule: if the
point fraction is less than 0.5, it rounds down; if it is greater than 0.5, it rounds up; if the value is exactly 0.5, it
rounds up if the preceding digit is odd, and down if the digit is even. For example: 166.3 = 166; 166.6 = 167;
167.5 =168; 166.5 = 166. See http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Leo/Stats8.html

EXTRA CREDIT There is no extra credit. Please take full advantage of the fact that you are permitted to
count the higher of two attempts on each exam toward the final grade, and that the labs are “open book” take
home assignments.
OTHER ISSUES Disabilities, Extensions, and Drops and Incompletes
Disabilities
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity and
Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259.
Extensions
Requests for an extension for missed work because of a sanctioned University activity, documented illness,
family-related emergency, or death in the family will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis but whatever the
circumstance, documentation is required. If you are unable to document your excuse, you will not be permitted
to make up the missed work. Because the labs and exams can be completed at any time, simply missing a Friday
deadline does not ensure that you will be permitted to make up missed work even if the excuse is documented.
Whatever the case – sanctioned University activity, documented illness, family-related emergency, or death in
the family – full documentation is required. If you find yourself so sick that you miss an exam or lab
submission, you should see a doctor, and if you do, the doctor will give you a written excuse.
Permission to make up missed exams or labs requires a completed Extension Permission Request Form
(available from the TA in SAC 5.112). The extension request, consisting of a completed Extension Permission
Request Form (available in SAC 5.112) and supporting documentation, must be submitted for consideration NO
LATER THAN ONE WEEK FOLLOWING THE MISSED EXAM OR LAB ASSIGNMENT WITH:
     1) If an illness, a medical excuse documented by a letter from your doctor;
     2) If a family emergency, written documentation;
     3) If a family death, an obituary or death certificate; or
     4) If a University-sanctioned activity, a letter from the director of the organization delivered to us
         BEFORE the event since these events are scheduled months in advance;
and the request must receive approval before any missed work can be made up. If you cannot provide
independent documentation that we can verify, the extension request will not be approved.
If a scheduling conflict arises from work or some other issues that will cause you to miss a deadline, please
inform us as early as possible so we can assess the validity of the conflict and make any necessary arrangements.
If you do not tell us ahead of time about a scheduled event, you will not receive permission to make up the
missed work.

Drops and Incompletes
If you find that you are unable to complete the course work, you may obtain a drop with a “Q” if you file the
appropriate paperwork that you can obtain from your dean’s office. This request must be filed by the University
deadline(s).
An incomplete can generally only be granted for a serious medical condition as documented by a letter from
your doctor. In only exceptional cases are other excuses considered legitimate grounds for an incomplete, and
these excuses generally require approval from you dean’s office.
We strongly advise you to finish the course as early as possible and thereby avoid any last-minute problems
                  It is your responsibility to finish the course on time!
