Prerequisites: ANT 301
(You will be best prepared for this course if you have had ANT 301, ANT 432L, or ANT 348-
Human Evolution).
Course description:
        This course is an in depth examination of the fossil record for nonhuman primate
evolution. After a basic grounding in the anatomy, ecology, and systematics (evolutionary
relationships) of living primates, we will explore each of the major radiations of fossil primates
with respect to adaptive diversity, functional morphology, and systematics. This course will
help you understand how the evolutionary process has resulted in a wide diversity of living as
well as extinct primates. Although we will not cover human evolution specifically, this course
will give you the perspective you need to understand the place of humans in primate
evolutionary history.
Course objectives: After taking the course, you should understand:
1) the systematics of living primates including the basic anatomical differences that distinguish
them functionally and phylogenetically.
2) current methodologies for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among primates
3) how the study of functional morphology in living primates can be applied to the
reconstruction of behavior in fossil primates.
4) the adaptations and phylogenetic relationships among fossil primates, and the relationships of
fossil primates to living primates.
                                                                                                  1

                                       Course requirements:
Lab assignments: You will complete one online lab and four in-class labs using fossil cast
material.
Online lab (Primate Form and Function): Available on Canvas. Due Jan 30 at 11:00 a.m.
In-class labs:There are four lab assignment sheets available for download from Canvas. Labs
will be held during regular class hours (see syllabus). You are required to bring your lab
assignment with you to class on lab days (along with your class notes and textbooks). You will
hand in your lab answer sheet before you leave class.
Exams: There will be 3 exams; the third exam is given on the last class day and is not
cumulative. Each exam will consist of a variety of types of questions, such as multiple choice,
short answers, and essays.
                                                                                                2


Paper: Each student will be required to write a 5-8 page paper, double spaced, 12 pt. font, 1
inch margins. The focus of the paper will be to compare primary (journal articles) and
secondary (science reports from the popular press) sources on the same topic within primate
evolution. Further information on the term paper can be found on Canvas.
        No later than March 31, you are required to submit your paper topic to me – at a
         minimum, you should list your primary source and at least one of your secondary
         sources. This way, I can let you know if you’re on the right track before it’s too late.
         Please come for help in advance of March 31 if you’re having trouble!
        The paper is due May 5 at 11:00 a.m. (see submission instructions on Canvas)
In conjunction with the paper, you are required to read a tutorial on plagiarism and take a short
test on it. The tutorial can be found at
https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/plagiarism/
The plagiarism test is available on Canvas, and should be completed no later than May 5.
Your term paper will not be graded unless you complete the plagiarism test.
Manage your time wisely when preparing to write the paper. This may help (even though
you’re not “dummies”!): http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/budgeting-your-time-

                                          Course policies:
The following policies are not intended to be harsh, but are included to provide clear guidelines
on issues that students often face throughout the semester.
Expectations:
I expect you to do the assigned readings in advance of the lectures and to come to class each
day on time. If we have an in-class lab that day, I expect you to come prepared with your
assignment sheet in hand (from Canvas). I will not provide copies of the assignment sheet. If
you forget to bring it, you will have to leave class and print it out on campus, which means you
will lose precious lab time. I do not take formal attendance, but I am aware of who consistently
comes to class and who doesn’t. Consistent attendance can help boost your grade if you end up
with a borderline final grade. Whether you come to class or not, you are responsible for keeping
up with what happens in class. This applies to the content of the class, handouts, and
announcements about class policies, events, deadlines, etc. Lectures and announcements can be
found on Canvas, but it is easy to miss other pertinent information if you are absent from class.
Guns.
As of August 1, 2016, due to the passage of S.B. 11 (https://campuscarry.utexas.edu), licensed,
concealed handguns are now allowed in most campus buildings, including classrooms. If you
hold a license to carry a concealed weapon, it is your responsibility to know and follow the
Texas and University policies listed here: https://campuscarry.utexas.edu/students. Visible
weapons or threatening behavior will be reported to the UT Police Department immediately.
The following statement serves as a reminder - I am required to notify you of this verbally, and
I will do so in class:
Based on my legal right to ban guns from my UT office, no guns are allowed in my office
(SAC 5.128). Leaving a gun unattended (as it would be, if left outside my office) is against the
law. Please plan accordingly. YOU are always welcome in my office, just not your gun. Thank
you.
Make-ups
There will be no make-up exams or in-class labs. Exceptions will be made only 1) with proof
of dire emergency or illness, 2) due to observance of a religious holy day, or 3) due to military
service.
                                                                                                  4


 Note: The 3rd exam is scheduled for the last week of classes. If you have other exams
scheduled that week, plan to budget your study time well. This happens often, so I cannot give
special consideration to students in this situation. I will also not provide alternative exam times
for students who have personal travel plans or commitments, so please don’t ask.
Illness or emergency: If you miss an exam or lab due to illness or emergency, contact me as
soon as possible either before the exam or within 2 days after the exam or lab. You will not be
given a make-up unless you can provide documentation regarding the reason for your absence.
Religious holy days. —By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at
least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a
class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day,
you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the
absence.
Absence for military service. In accordance with section 51.9111 of the Texas Education
Code, a student is excused from attending classes or engaging in other required activities,
including exams, if he or she is called to active military service of a reasonably brief duration.
[The maximum time for which the student may be excused has been defined by the Texas
Higher Education Coordinating Board as "no more than 25 percent of the total number of class
meetings or the contact hour equivalent (not including the final examination period) for the
specific course or courses in which the student is currently enrolled at the beginning of the
period of active military service.”] The student will be allowed a reasonable time after the
absence to complete assignments and take exams.
Students with disabilities: Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
Students with Disabilities at 512-471-6259 (voice) or 512-410-6644 (video phone) or
ssd@austin.utexas.edu or http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/. Please inform me as soon as
possible if you need accommodations.
Late assignments
Late term papers or labs will cost you 10 points (out of 100) per day. This could change your
grade dramatically. Don't be late!
Grades
The grade you are given, either on an individual exam or assignment or as your final grade, is
not the starting point of a negotiation. It is your grade unless an error has been made. If you
think an error has been made, let me know within one week of receiving the assignment or
exam grade.
** Important! I do not offer “extra credit” opportunities, but I am happy to help you find ways
to improve your grade. If you are struggling in the course, please come for help during the
semester when there is still time for me to help you. Take advantage of my office hours or make
an appointment with me. Do not wait until the course is almost over to discuss your grade with
                                                                                                    5


me. By then, it is too late for me to help you.
Honor Code: Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor
Code.:
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward
peers and community.
Scholastic Dishonesty
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from The
University. Scholastic dishonesty" includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism,
collusion, falsifying academic records, misrepresenting facts, and any act designed to give
unfair academic advantage to the student (such as, but not limited to, submission of essentially
the same written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor), or
the attempt to commit such an act.
