                                First summer session, 2019

Course Description
In this class, students are offered a “hands-on” opportunity to work with a real client and the experience
of developing an actual campaign. It requires from you to implement or put into action the knowledge you
have gained throughout your years at UT. You are required to create one holistic and unified campaign.
Via mentorship, we will work on how to match various variables and marketing concepts such as the
product/service, the consumer, media profiles, research, planning and the actual execution of a campaign,
into one macro-level understanding of the brand. Students will be working as advertising/communication
teams.
Overarching Goals and Objectives
     1) The ability to be independent and creative with your work.
     2) Working as a team member.
     3) Identifying the core essence of your client and their business.
     4) Applying your knowledge and skills.
     5) The ability to develop a holistic point of view.
     6) Practice and master your communication and design skills
Teaching Method and structure
It is important to note that this class requires from you, the students, a great deal of independence
and responsibility. This is especially true since it is conducted in a virtual environment, during a
short-summer session. The instructor will communicate and mentor the students via the Canvas
program. Thus, it is crucial, students will check canvas regularly and every day.
The structure: at the beginning of every week, each team or representative/s of a team will meet
with the instructor or the TA for consultation, via the Canvas conference room. At the end of
each week, every team will record a presentation and upload the recording+ presentation slides
into Canvas, under the appropriate assignment deck! Overall: we have 5 consultations and 5
presentations.
                                                                                                     1


Team selection: at the very beginning of the session each individual will pitch to the class about
their ideal advertising agency and why they should be the CEO of that agency. Students will pick
their top agencies and based on that your teams will be formed.

responsibility to check Canvas every day during the current summer session.
Assignments
The following section provides a brief summary of the course assignments.
    1) Campaign Presentation 1 (Team Project): teams will present their perception of the
        client and the brand: what is the soul of the brand? What is the purpose and the why of
        the brand? What is the problem? Who is the target audience? SWOT? (see phase 1 in the
        instructions)
    2) Campaign Presentation 2 (Team Project): teams will continue working on phase 1 plus
        phase 2, which is the creation of a big idea. A big idea is a short creative phrase that will
        guide your entire campaign.
    3) Campaign Presentation 3 (Team Project): teams will present the 3rd phase of their
        campaign: the execution phase. Emanating directly from the first and second phases of
        the campaign, teams will actually showcase their communication plan and design (this is
        your chance to present ads, events, viral movies, social media, new and creative
        communication ideas, fund-raising ideas, etc.’; all in direct conjunction with your client
        and its target audience).
    4) Campaign Presentation 4 (Team Project): continued and improved work on phase 3.
    5) The Final presentation + Book (Team Project): the final presentation and book are the
        products of all previous presentations. This is the time to refine your work and to create
        an integrated output. Each team will pitch to the client and a winning team will be
        selected! (The project is comprised of a book plan + a presentation).
    6) Peer Evaluation (individual grade): you will evaluate your group members’
        contribution to the project at the end of the semester.
                                                                                                      2

Religious Holy Days Observance Policy
The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student
from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of
a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused
under this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an
examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable
time after the absence. A student who misses classes or other required activities, including
examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in
                                                                                                 4

assignment within a reasonable time after the
absence.http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi03-04/ch4/ch4g.html#attendance
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning
process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and
submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and
must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and
readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University. For more information on scholastic dishonesty,
please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site at http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/.
