PREREQUISITE
To take this class, you must be a Public Relations major and have completed ADV 318J,
PR 319, and PR or J 317 or J 315 (or its equivalent).
REQUIRED MATERIALS
    •  Public Relations Writing and Media Relations Techniques (8th Edition)
       By: Dennis L. Wilcox and Bryan H. Reber
       ISBN: 978-0134010496
       Publisher: Pearson, 2016
    •  Associated Press Stylebook, 2019 or newer (or online version)
    •  Microsoft Office Word & Excel
ELECTRONIC REQUIREMENTS
Good Public Relations practitioners are rabid media junkies; so it is essential for PR
students to become avid media consumers. You need to be reading all sorts of websites
for current events/news. Some of the sites you should be absorbing include:
NPR -- http://www.npr.org
The New York Times – www.nytimes.com
The Wall Street Journal – www.wsj.com
Business Week – www.businessweek.com
CNN – www.cnn.com
MSNBC – www.msnbc.msn.com
FOX News – www.foxnews.com
COURSE DESCRIPTION
PR 348 is a writing intensive, skill-building class for PR majors, emphasizing the study


and practice of AP Style, media writing and communications techniques for earned and
owned media.
The “big picture” goal for this class is to expose you to the knowledge and skills
necessary for you to be an effective Public Relations practitioner when you graduate.
And remember, good writing takes practice, hard work and dedication.
CLASS MEETING, COMMUNICATION AND FACEBOOK GROUP
There are no virtual classroom meetings to attend in this web-based course. Instead,
you’ll listen to audio recordings of me explaining each assignment, discussing key
takeaways from chapters in our textbook, and sharing information pertinent to your
career in PR. While you can listen to these at your own pace, you’ll want to keep up as
each recording is designed to help with assignments.
I will communicate with you through Canvas and email. You are responsible for
checking your email on a regular basis and are responsible for the content of those
emails. Failure to check your email does not excuse you from meeting the
responsibilities outlined in the message.
Conversely, email is an excellent way for you to communicate with me. I will respond to
your email within 24 hours of receiving it on weekdays or by Monday morning if I
receive it on the weekend. Many times I will email you back sooner.
The only time we may meet “in person” is during weekly office hours. This class has a
private Facebook group and I will post the link to Canvas. Every Wednesday from noon
to 1 p.m. CST, I will be in our group answering any questions you have about the
readings, assignments, writing and general PR topics. Don’t worry if you can’t attend
“live.” The Q&A will be available in the group whenever you log in.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
•       Provide students with an in-depth understanding of the essentials necessary to be
a successful Public Relations practitioner. For this to happen, the emphasis in the course
is on each individual learning-by-doing.
•       Increase students’ level of competence and professionalism by helping them
sharpen the following skills: strategic and critical thinking, planning, organizational,
written and verbal communication, time management, interpersonal, and task group
(bringing out the best in others).
SPECIFIC LEARNING OBJECTIVES
•       To learn to write clear, concise, accurate copy, using good grammar and
mechanics;
•       To learn how to use the Associated Press Stylebook and basic standards for
copyediting;
•       To practice basic PR story forms from news releases and pitches to podcasting;
•       To gain media literacy and learn media relations techniques;
•       To learn critical thinking skills needed to connect with target audiences and key


publics; and
•      To learn research skills for gathering information, developing content and
checking facts, in order to uphold the values of accuracy and credibility.
STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES
I expect each of you to be responsible individuals. As such, you must:
•      Meet strict deadlines and solve sometimes ambiguous problems;
•      Sell your ideas and defend your opinions/recommendations;
•      Work closely and respectfully with others;
•      Demonstrate creativity, enthusiasm and hard work; and
•      Present yourself and your work in a highly professional manner.
KEEPING UP WITH READINGS
Readings will correspond to assignments and other related topics, but I won’t be
providing outlines or reviewing every detail from the readings. My audio talks will
highlight important information and supplement the readings with examples and new
information. It’s up to you to keep up.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS
As a web-based course, activities, including lectures, quizzes, and assignments, will be
managed electronically. For this class, you’ll be taking quizzes and submitting
assignments on Canvas.
Each student is required to take four AP Style and Textbook quizzes and complete three
assignments. This course is only five weeks, which means deadlines are NOT
NEGOTIABLE. Unless you have a VERY good reason and it’s been cleared with me IN
ADVANCE, you will receive 0 points on your assignment if you miss a
deadline.
**PLEASE NOTE: Two of the three assignments are “revision” assignments.
If you do not submit the original assignment, you also will receive 0 points
on the revision.**
ASSIGNMENTS
Below are synopses of the assignments you will be responsible for this summer session.
Memos detailing each assignment will be posted on Canvas.
All assignments will be written using AP Style. Points will be deducted for AP Style,
grammar, spelling and punctuation mistakes.
AP Style and Textbook Quizzes
Quiz 1 Due: Friday, July 19, at 5 p.m. CST
Quiz 2 Due: Friday, July 26, at 5 p.m. CST
Quiz 3 Due: Friday, Aug. 2, at 5 p.m. CST
Quiz 4 Due: Friday, Aug. 9, at 5 p.m. CST


At this point, you need a working knowledge of AP Style and the textbook material. To
build these skills and test your knowledge, you’ll take four quizzes over the session.
You’ll have 10 minutes to answer 10 questions, sans the AP Stylebook and textbook.
News Release
Original Release Due: Friday, July 19, at 11:59 p.m. CST
Revised Release Due: Friday, Aug. 2, at 11:59 p.m. CST
Although it may take on many forms today, the news release is still an important tool in
the PR toolkit. For this assignment, you’ll write a hard news release, paying attention to
AP Style, grammar and usage, writing clean and lean copy, choosing and ordering
content according to purpose and audience, and attributing information and integrating
quotes.
Media Pitch
Original Pitch Due: Friday, July 26, at 11:59 p.m. CST
Revised Pitch Due: Friday, Aug. 9, at 11:59 p.m. CST
If writing is 99 percent of what we do in Public Relations, then pitching is 95 percent of
that. Most of what you’ll do on the job is pitch directly to a specific reporter, blogger
and/or influencer with a newsworthy angle that gets them to write or produce a story
about your company or clients. For this assignment, you’ll research and write a pitch
based on a specific scenario.
Panel Podcast
Due: Friday, Aug. 16, at 11:59 p.m. CST
Brands are jumping on the podcasting bandwagon, especially after the success of Serial,
a true crime podcast released in October 2014. And as a PR professional, you need to be
able to deliver a show that captivates an audience. In teams, you’ll create and record a
panel podcast on a topic of interest to the SRS community.

_______________________________________________________
Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric. Please note: to
ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any


stage. For example, a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999%. The
University does not recognize the grade of A+.
A = 94-100%
A- = 90-93
B+ = 87-89
B = 84-86
B- = 80-83
C+ = 77-79
C = 74-76
C- = 70-73
D+ = 67-69
D = 64-66
D- = 60-63
F = 0-60
Please note that extra credit will NOT be offered.
GRADING OF WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS
Criteria for grading your writing assignments will be based on the instructions for each
one, but some general criteria will apply to all: writing clearly, using correct AP Style,
having appropriate content, integrating quotes effectively, attributing information
properly, writing good ledes, organizing and formatting effectively, and avoiding
unprofessional errors. Emphasis on each area will vary according to the assignment.
I recognize that writing is a subjective art, not an exact science. As such, the grading of
writing is vulnerable to ambiguities. So, while I will try to be precise in my expectations,
and specific with my comments, sometimes you might just have to accept my judgment
and authority, just like you would be forced to do if writing for an editor or upper
manager. At the same time, I expect legitimate questions and requests for clarification.
That’s part of the learning process and the mark of a good Public Relations
communicator. In this class, just as in the PR business, you need thick skin and the
ability to accept criticism. Just remember that criticism of your writing is not a criticism
of you personally or your abilities.
And one more thing. It’s imperative that you proofread, check facts and spell-check
EVERYTHING. You can ruin a very good news release or article by misspelling names,
making sloppy errors in grammar and usage, or misstating facts. Make sure whatever
you turn in is in the best shape it can be given your deadline. In the real world of Public
Relations, committing such faux pas can damage your reputation and damage the
credibility of whomever you're representing.
WRITING FLAG COURSE
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write
regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive
feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the
opportunity to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a


substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes
meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication,
Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education
Coordinating Board.
MOODY COLLEGE WRITING SUPPORT PROGRAM
The Moody College Writing Support Program, located in BMC 3.322,
https://moody.utexas.edu/students/moodywriting, offers one-on-one assistance
without charge to students seeking to improve their professional writing in all fields of
communication. In addition, they offer workshops to strengthen core writing skills in
each field and to inspire students to strive for excellence. Students may book half-hour
appointments through the website or drop in for assistance during all stages of the
writing process.
COURSE STANDARDS AND DEADLINES
    • All assignments must be turned in on time. Unless you have a VERY good reason
       and it’s been cleared with me IN ADVANCE, you will receive 0 points on
       your assignment if you miss a deadline.
    •  All work must be produced on a personal computer and be professional in
       appearance. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors will result in a loss of
       points.
    •  Any questions or arguments about a grade must be presented in writing within
       seven (7) days after the points are posted or returned.
UNIVERSITY AND COURSE POLICIES/STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Use of Email for Official Correspondence to Students
Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are
responsible for reading your email for university and course-related information and
announcements. You are responsible to keep the university informed about changes to
your email address. You should check your email regularly and frequently—to stay
current with university-related communications, some of which may be time-critical.
You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating your email address at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
toward peers and community.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized
collaboration, falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating
honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited


to, providing false or misleading information to receive a postponement or an extension
on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same written
assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By accepting
this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic
dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and readiness for the future
demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on scholastic
dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the
course and/or dismissal from the University.

holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time before or after the absence if you give the required advance notification.
