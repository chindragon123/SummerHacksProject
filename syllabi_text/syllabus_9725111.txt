Course Description: This course introduces some of Japan’s important works of sci-fi and speculative
fiction in the postwar era (1945-present). We will explore the ways that literature and film’s futuristic
narratives and imagery change during periods of economic prosperity or prolonged recession. Central
to our discussions will be the slippage between utopian and dystopian worldviews, the fascination and
fear of high-tech society, the ongoing threat of global apocalypse, and the gradual dawning of the
posthuman era. No prerequisites are required for this course, although familiarity with postwar
Japanese history will be helpful.
Required Texts:
Japan Sinks, (1973), Sakyo Komatsu
All You Need is Kill (2004), Hiroshi Sakurazaka
The Best Japanese Science Fiction Stories (1989), Edited by John Apolstolou & Martin Greenberg (JSFS)
Speculative Japan 4 (2018), Edited by Edward Lipsett (SJ)
Additional readings will be made available on Canvas (Can)
Course Objectives:
• Students will read, analyze, interpret, and discuss a variety of Japanese science fiction texts
• Students will learn techniques for conducting literary and film analysis
• Students will demonstrate comprehension of important concepts through discussions, quizzes, and
     written assignments
• Students will gain greater familiarity with Japanese culture through readings, discussions and
     written assignments
Course Work:
Attendance & Participation: In addition to attending class, I am asking each student to do a
presentation of one of the short stories. Detailed guidelines for how to approach the presentations are
attached. In terms of grading, the Attendance/Participation grade is worth 25% of the total.
Attendance will be worth 10%, participation in discussions will be worth 5% and the presentation will be
worth 10%.
Unit Quizzes: After completing a unit, we will have a quiz that will cover lecture material, readings and
discussions. These quizzes will consist of multiple choice, T/F and possibly some short identification
questions. The quizzes will take place at the beginning of the class for which they are scheduled. The
total points for all quizzes will amount to 25% of the final grade.


Written Assignments: There will be three written assignments due at various points in the semester. I
am asking each student to write a brief (1 – 2 pages, worth 5%) reflection following your presentation
(see attached presentation guidelines). Each student will also write a brief (1 – 2 pages, worth 5%)
response to questions for the novel Japan Sinks (see attached). Finally, each student will write a longer
(5 -6 pages, worth 15%) paper to be handed in at the end of the semester. Information about this paper
is attached.
Final Exam: The Final Exam is currently scheduled for Saturday, December 14, 7:00 pm-10:00 pm. I am
trying to reschedule it.

Class Policies
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your
familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least
one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Readings are listed in the syllabus on the day they are due. If you see a reading on the syllabus for a
certain day, it means we will cover it that day.
Absences
Excused Absence: The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious holidays or
extenuating circumstances due to an emergency. If you plan to miss class due to observance of a religious
holiday, please let us know at least two weeks in advance. You will not be penalized for this absence,
although you will still be responsible for any work you will miss on that day if applicable. Check with us
for details or arrangements.
If you have to be absent, ask a classmate for notes on any lessons you miss. If you find there are topics
that we covered while you were gone that raise questions, you may come by during office hours or
schedule a meeting to discuss. Email specific questions you have in advance so that we can make the
most of our time. “What did I miss?” is not specific enough.
Student Rights & Responsibilities
Students have a right to an inclusive learning environment where they are respected, graded fairly,
provided with opportunities to freely express opinions, and guaranteed privacy and confidentiality
where appropriate. In return, each of us is responsible for treating others with respect, listening
courteously and doing our best to make the learning environment supportive to all. If you are feeling
that the class is not meeting this standard, please let the instructor or TA know so that the issue can be
addressed as quickly as possible.
Names & Personal Pronouns
Class rosters are provided to the instructor with students’ legal name. I will gladly honor your request to
address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the
semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.
University Policies
Academic Integrity
      Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a
      student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and
      uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or
      ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources.
      Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including
      failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the
                                                       4


      University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:

Important Safety Information:
If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs or Professors, call BCAL
(the Behavior Concerns Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous. If something
doesn’t feel right – it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety
and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
assembling outside.
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that
the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building. Students requiring
assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class. In the
event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building
unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin
Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office. Link to information regarding emergency
evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at: www.utexas.edu/emergency
Title IX Reporting
      Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual
      harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally
      funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working
      environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our
      community, the university can:
                1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
                2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm
                or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
                3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
      Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
      “Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the
      Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents
      that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty
      or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible
      employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official
      report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting
      options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at
      titleix@austin.utexas.edu.

                                 ANS 372: Japanese Science Fiction
                             Questions for Sakyo Komatsu’s Japan Sinks
Please begin reading Japan Sinks as soon as you can. We will discuss the book following Quiz #
2 in our October 17 class. To assist us in our discussion, I am asking you to write a brief, one
paragraph (roughly a half-page, double spaced) response to each of the questions below. For
each response, please include a quote from the book, and the page where you found it.
Questions:
    1. Japan Sinks has many characters, and frequently changes the characters it focuses on. Do
        you think there is a conventional hero in this story? If so, who is it, and why do you
        believe s/he is the novel’s hero(ine)?
    2. In “The Imagination of Disaster,” Susan Sontag’s highly influential essay on science
        fiction films, the author states that the genre is concerned with, “the aesthetics of
        destruction, with the peculiar beauties to be found in wreaking havoc, making a mess.”
        (Sontag, 213). Japan Sinks was a very popular disaster novel, made into a popular movie
        the year of its publication (1973). What do you think of its “aesthetics of destruction”?
        Is it credible and entertaining? What role do you think the aesthetics of destruction play
        in the success of this book?
    3. Japan Sinks was written in the early 1970s, shortly after the celebration of the first Earth
        Day in April of 1970. Many nations had begun to notice the effects of environmental
        pollution on their populations, including Japan, which was scandalized by mercury
        poisonings in Minamata in 1971. Can Japan Sinks be viewed as a novel about
        environmental disaster? What, if anything, does it have in common with other potential
        environmental disasters?
    4. How would you characterize the solution the Japanese government eventually adopts for
        dealing with the disaster? What do you think would happen to Japanese identity if there
        were no nation of Japan?
I will collect your responses to these questions on Oct. 17. This will count as one of your short
paper writing assignments. You do not have to cite the book when you include quotes. Just put
the page number in parentheses following the quote. Be sure to proofread!
                                                    7

                                        Presentation Assignment
Each student will be asked to introduce and explain one of the required short story readings to
the class. You will be able to choose which story you want to present, and the presentation will
be given on the day that the story is listed in the syllabus. The stories vary quite a bit in terms of
length, but you should strive for a presentation of about 20 minutes, and then questions that
could lead to a wide-ranging discussion of the story. Feel free to use PowerPoint, but be aware
of how to make a good presentation (engage the audience, don’t overload slides with text, etc).
Presentations should Include:
    • Information about the author: brief bio, other published works, themes explored,
        interests
    • Story Synopsis: what actually happens in the story
    • Stand-out Quotes: lines that caught your attention or seem important or revealing
    • An Interpretation: Many of these stories are challenging. Try to provide an
        interpretation beyond what literally happens. You might explore some of the tropes the
        story includes, or try to interpret the story as an allegory that comments on the role of the
        individual in society, or the Japanese nation in a global context. Generally, try to offer
        some new way to look at the story.
    • Connection to Unit: What does the story contribute to our understanding of Disaster,
        Time/Space, etc.?
    • Important Vocabulary: Japanese words, technical terms, made up words, etc.
    • Discussion Questions: Provide two or three questions that could lead to substantive
        discussion of the story.
Reflective Statement (1-2 pages):
As one of your writing assignments, I would like you to write a brief statement about your
presentation. Part of this can include your interpretation of the story (what you think it means).
The rest should be devoted to detailing the work that went into the presentation. Outline the
steps taken for researching and preparing the presentation as well as what you learned from
doing it. I have posted readings on Canvas for each unit that could be helpful in analyzing the
stories. If you use those readings, definitely include that in your reflective statement.
I will do the first presentation of Edogawa Ranpo’s “Hell of Mirrors” on Thurs. Sept 5 to provide
a model for how to approach this assignment. The first student presentations will begin on Tues.
Sept. 17.

                                   Long Paper Assignment Options
There are a number of possibilities for the final paper, but in general, the papers should be 5 -6
pages in length, well written, and conforming to standard English grammatical, spelling and
punctuation rules. Strictly speaking, it is not a research paper, but if you do use any outside
sources, be sure to include a bibliography and use a recognized citation style. You are welcome
to use any of the readings available on Canvas to assist in your analysis.
    1. Time Loops in Hiroshi Sakurazaka’s All You Need is Kill: The main character in All
        You Need is Kill experiences a unique form of time travel. How is it explained in the
        novel? Is it convincing? Have you seen this time loop strategy used in any other works
        of fiction? What popular narrative forms use the time loop and why? What reasons
        might the author have for using it in All You Need is Kill?
    2. Short Story Explication: Although we are reading most of the stories in the two
        required collections, there are a few that have been excluded. For this option, you could
        either choose a story we did not read and make an argument for its inclusion in one of our
        four thematic categories, or make an argument for a fifth category by grouping together
        several stories in the collections and pointing out similarities between them. What would
        you call this fifth category? What would be its crucial components? Explain how the
        stories you explore contain and utilize these components, how it relates to Japanese
        society, and why this is an important aspect of the science fiction or speculative fiction
        genre.
    3. Analysis of a Japanese Sci-Fi work not included in this class: If there is an external
        short story, novel, film or anime that you are familiar with and would like to analyze and
        write about, this is your opportunity. You could make an argument for including it in
        one of our four units. How does it conform to the parameters we have discussed? Why
        is it an important, ground-breaking work that should be included in this sort of class? For
        this option, you may want to use some of the readings on Canvas.
    4. Creative Option: Many Sci-Fi readers are also writers. This is an opportunity to write a
        5 - 6 page piece of speculative fiction exploring your own ideas. Try to make your story
        conform to one of the four themes we have discussed this semester (Disaster &
        Apocalypse, Utopia/Dystopia, etc.).
By midterm, I will be asking you to commit to one of the above options. If you have any
questions about your topic, feel free to consult me. The final paper will be due in our last class,
Thursday, December 5, 2019.
