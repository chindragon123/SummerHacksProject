Objectives & Academic/Learning Goals of Course:
                     The course is designed with several academic goals in mind:
                     1. To help you become familiar with the role of architectural engineers in society.
                     2. To enable you to get to know faculty and students
                     3. To assist you in your transition to UT Austin and to the ArE major.
                     4. To provide an overview of the ArE curriculum at UT Austin.

                     Final grades will based on the + or – system, e.g. A-. B+
                     Grading percentages:
                     90-100 A-, A
                     80-90 B-, B, B+
                     70-80 C-, C, C+
                     60-70 D-, D, D+
                     < 60 F
        Assignments and Reports include keeping an ARE 102 notebook of your class notes (lecture highlights)
        for the semester. The notebook will consist of:
             - Handwritten or typed notes of each lecture. The notes need to be about one page for each lecture.
                 You do not need both written notes and copies of slides, but you may wish to make notes on the
                 slides instead of writing in page format.
             - Typed one-page summary of at least one Architectural Engineering Institute meetings (or ASCE or
                 other approved society if you can’t make an AEI meeting - verify alternatives with the TA). Put this
                 at the very front of your ARE 102 notebook to be turned in at the end of the semester.
             - Typed one-page summary of at least one visits to the Learning Skills Center during the semester.
                 You also need to put a copy of this at the very front of your notebook.
        The notebook is due to be turned in during the last class period on November 30.—if late 10% per day will
        be deducted. It will not be accepted after Dec. 5. The notebook is not to be a three-ring binder—it is to be
        a paper binder that is thin. We have difficulty carrying all of the binders back to our office when thick binders
        are used.
       Class Attendance will be recorded during each class and the grade score will be based on this record.
                                                                                                                      1/4


          Exams: Instead of the final exam at the end of the semester there will be two in-class exams. The two
          exams will be short exams, 20 minutes in length; the first exam will cover the reading assignments and
          lectures from the beginning of the course and the second exam will cover reading and lectures from the
          first exam. They will be multiple-choice or short answer and open book. Refer to the reading schedule on
          page 3 for the material to be covered on each exam.
          Project: The course project is the wood model project, and it will be assembled by the students individually
          or in teams using small scale wood members glued together. The model will be a small wood framed
          structure such as a small cabin or large shed. Project details will be provided in class related to Residential
          Construction.
Academic Honesty:
IMPORTANT! Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and dismissal from The University. Since dishonesty harms the
individual, all students, and the integrity of The University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. (See General Information, The University of Texas at Austin, 2001-2002, Appendix C, Subchapters 11-
801 and 11-802, Student Standard of Conduct (see http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi00-
01/app/appc11.html). This policy is also provided on Blackboard. Remember, individual assignments are not
group projects and do not build on the efforts of others without due reference.
For additional information on these items see the Deans of students website, and University General Information
Catalog, at: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/, and http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi11-12/.
Students with Disabilities:
The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement,
Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259 or http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd.
Privacy:
Web-based, password-protected class sites may be associated with all academic courses taught at the
University. Syllabi, handouts, assignments and other resources are types of information that may be available
within these sites. Site activities could include exchanging email, engaging in class discussions and chats, and
exchanging files. In addition, electronic class rosters will be a component of the sites. Students who do not want
their names included in these electronic class rosters must restrict their directory information in the Office of the
Registrar, Main Building, Room 1. For information on restricting directory information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi00-01/app/appc09.html.
Course Evaluations:
An evaluation of the course and instructor will be conducted at the end of the semester using the approved UT
Course/Instructor evaluation forms.
Dropping the Class:
From the 1st through the 12th class day, an undergraduate student can drop a course via the web and receive a
refund, if eligible. From the 13th through the university’s academic drop deadline, a student may Q drop a course
with approval from the Dean, and departmental advisor.
Computer Usage:
With the exception of using word processing systems in the development of assignments, this course does not
directly involve computer usage. The web-based UT Blackboard system (https://courses.utexas.edu) will be used
extensively to coordinate class assignments and disseminate course information, including class notes.
Religious Holy Days.
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a
religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements
can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.
