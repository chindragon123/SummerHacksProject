Course Description
        More than any time since the collapse of the Cold War, the international relations of East
Asia are in flux—perhaps dangerously so. The rules of engagement and balance of power in the
region are rapidly changing, and economic, political, and even cultural animosities are
intensifying. What explains these recent trends? And how do they reflect and influence
American power in the region? To tackle these and related questions, this course takes a deep
dive into three major themes in the region’s contemporary international relations: Japan’s
increasingly assertive military posture; the economic, political, and military rise of China; and
the ongoing North Korean nuclear and missile threat. We explore each topic from the
perspective of different IR theories and assess the impact of history and institutions—both
domestic and international—on changing state behavior. Along the way, we touch on a range of
related issues that are the stuff of today’s headline news, including the impact of war and
memory on political and economic relations in the region; the fraught relationship between
China and Taiwan; increasing tensions over uninhabitable islands in the East and South China
seas; Russia’s heightened presence in the region; and the current standoff between Hong Kong
and China.
        Although this course is primarily lecture-based, there will be plenty of opportunities for
class discussions and debates. It is my hope that by the end of the semester, students will have
acquired not only a strong grounding in the facts of international relations in this crucial region
of the world, but also a deep appreciation of the values and assumptions that inform various
interpretations of the significance of those facts.
        This course carries the “Global Cultures Flag,” which means it is designed to increase
student familiarity with cultural groups outside the U.S. Accordingly, we will pay close
attention to some of the cultural and institutional foundations of international relations in the
region, and with reference to comparable Western experiences.
                                                                                                    1
