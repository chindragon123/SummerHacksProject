COURSE OBJECTIVES:
A. Develop an appreciation for the importance of cell biology, biochemistry and molecular biology in nutrient
   uptake and metabolism.
B. Understand the basic concepts and importance of metabolic regulation at the whole body, organ and
   cellular level.
C. Gain an understanding how multiple nutrients work together to regulate physiological function.
D. Develop the ability to integrate carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism in energy homeostasis.
E. Discuss how changes in metabolism are important for maintaining health and/or developing diseases.
F. Describe the roles of the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in macronutrient metabolism and meeting
   energy demands in various dietary conditions.
1. Prerequisites for NTR 326
       Credit* in NTR 312 or 312H for Nutrition majors.
       Nutrition 312 with a grade of at least C in each.
2. Students with disabilities.
   Please notify me of any modification/adaptation you may require to accommodate a disability-related need.
   You will be requested to provide documentation to the Dean of Students’ Office, in order that the most

3. Grade Determination
   100% 5 Exams (4 Exams count)               (25% for each exam)
   NOTE: THE LOWEST OF ALL 5 EXAMS MAY BE DROPPED
   Grade Reporting
      Grades will be reported as:
        90-100         A
        80-89          B
        70-79          C
        60-69          D
        < 61           F
4. Exams:
      •    LECTURE MATERIAL WILL SERVE AS EXAM QUESTIONS.
      •    If figures/tables from other books are used, then only the information presented in class will be
           used for exams.
      •    THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP EXAMS. If an exam is missed, then that is your dropped
           exam grade.
      •    The material covered will be all the lecture material since the last exam.
      •    Pay special attention to things that are highlighted or asterisked by me in lectures. These items are
           more likely to be test questions.
      •    All exams are multiple choice with scantron.
      •    The format of the exams will consist of multiple choice and short answer essays.
      •    Questions regarding exam grading should be made, in writing, to the instructor (Dr. Jolly). For
           exam re-evaluation this must occur by the second class day following the return of the exam.
5. Texts:
      •    MANDATORY TEXT:                 Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism, sixth Edition,
           Gropper/Smith/Groff, Thompson-Wadsworth, 2012. Reading assignments for this textbook are
           given in the course outline.
      •    The lecture material is derived from a mixture of cell biology, biochemistry and nutrition textbooks.
6. Lecture Notes
   ü Handouts will be posted on Canvas.
   ü Handouts serve as an outline of the key content of the class and supply many of the diagrams/figures
      that we will discuss.

7. Discussion sections:
          Ø  No new material will be presented.
          Ø  Dr. Jolly leads the sections and will reinforce the lecture material.
          Ø  This is your time to gain clarification on lecture material.
          Ø  Bring your questions!
