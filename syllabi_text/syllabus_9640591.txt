REQUIREMENTS
Prerequisite: Credit for or concurrent enrollment with a C average in BIO 365S (Systems
Physiology) is required. Please notify your instructor if you do not have the BIO 365S
prerequisite.
Required Materials:
     Lab manual - available in print from the Co-op. Additional documents maybe posted in
        the class master Canvas site. It is your responsibility to bring the appropriate printed
        pages to lab.
     Book: Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach (Silverthorn, 8e preferred; 7e ok)
     Lab Attire: long pants, closed toe shoes, either scrub top or lab coat or jacket (hip
        length or longer, any color). Search online (e.g., Amazon.com) for lab coats or
        purchase locally. Examples of places to buy are J.C. Penney, Total Uniforms (1301 W
        34th St).
COURSE GOALS
This lab provides hands-on experience with human physiology, using an experimental approach.
Thus, you and/or your team will be required to read the primary scientific literature, write
protocols, and collect and analyze data. You will summarize these data either in a lab report or
by writing a results and discussions in the format of scientific papers submitted for publication.
This lab also has a health professions focus, thus you will analyze case studies and make
diagnoses. We hope that the emphasis on science will give you an appreciation for the origin of
the information so necessary for health professions.
This course consists of one four-hour laboratory session a week, plus additional time outside of
lab needed for completion of assignments, research, or computer work. We hope that you have
fun in this course and we welcome your comments, critiques, and suggestions.


Course Goals
1. allow students to experience the physiology they have studied in lecture
2. give students an appreciation for structure-function relationships of the human body
3. give students experience collecting, analyzing, and presenting data
4. give students an appreciation of the variability inherent in a population of humans
5. give students an understanding of the difficulties inherent in designing experiments using
human subjects
6. have students work together effectively in teams
7. encourage students to apply physiology in the form of case studies
Course Objectives. Students who complete this class should be able to:
1. describe the basic anatomy and physiology of various organ systems studied in the lab.
2. search, read, evaluate, and properly reference the primary literature.
3. design a controlled experiment, write a protocol for it, and execute it.
4. analyze and critique the design of experiments of others.
5. collect appropriate data, analyze it, and present it in the most appropriate form (graph or
table).
6. write and cite in correct scientific format.
7. use Excel for spreadsheet, data analysis, and graph construction.
8. use a word processing program such as Word to write and import graphics.
9. use basic lab equipment including computer data acquisition systems.
10. cooperate with classmates and work effectively in teams.
11. analyze case studies
EXPECTATIONS
You are expected to:
Attend all labs. Roll will be taken in lab. Attendance will not be excused for illness without a
written doctor’s note. The only excuse for missing class will be documented illness or
death/major illness in the family, or other emergencies approved by the course director. It is
NOT APPROPRIATE to schedule doctor/vet/car/interview appointments during your assigned
lab time because there will be no makeups for unexcused absences. When you miss a lab, your
absence also affects your team members. Students who miss assignments without an excused
absence will receive a zero for the missed assignment.
If you miss a lab, please consult the director to determine whether it is more appropriate to attend
a lab later in the week or to simply obtain data from lab mates. Missing a lab or going to a
different lab section one week due to an excused absence does NOT excuse you from your
responsibility to your team. You are still expected to contribute fully to the team’s work, even if
you were not in the lab to collect the data with the team. In some instances you might be asked to
work with the team in your makeup lab instead of your original assigned team.
Contribute appropriately while in lab. We expect that you will be on time to lab, stay until all
work is complete, clean up the work area after completion of the lab and cooperate with lab
mates and instructors. You should exhibit a good attitude, cheerfulness, and interest. Each lab
team should wash, dry, and store all glassware and supplies, and leave its workstation clean and


organized. The TA will check each workstation before anyone is allowed to leave lab. If a
student is consistently deficient in these attributes, we will document this and we reserve the
right to subtract up to 5% of your semester grade from your final average for failure to
perform adequately in lab.
Work in teams and evaluate your lab partners. Learning how to work effectively with
colleagues will be an important part of your post-college career, so this course is designed to
give you practice in this area. Team members must be able to communicate effectively with each
other and negotiate division of labor. If your team members are not doing their share of the work
or not interacting appropriately, you will be able to rate their performance through confidential
peer evaluations. For all group experiments, the team turns in one proposal, protocol, methods,
or results and discussion. All team members will get the same grade for this written work.
However, if a conflict cannot be resolved, team members may turn in separate papers.
You will be working in teams of 3-4 for these labs. Instructors will make the team assignments.
You will change teams several times during the semester. You are expected to work together for
all stages of each lab. That means that you must be able to contact each other outside of the lab
setting to collaborate on reports.
You will turn in peer evaluations for each team and for each member in the team. Peer
evaluations are done through Canvas and the results of individual evaluations will be seen only
by the instructors, so you can be honest about what you say.
You will be on multiple teams during the semester and your compiled peer evaluations (how you
are scored by your team mates) count as 3% of your grade. Because it is important that everyone
rates the other members of the team, completion of peer evaluations will also count as 3% of the
grade. If your evaluations indicate that you are not doing your fair share of the work, you will be
warned.
What kinds of behaviors make a bad team member?
             not doing fair share of the work
             failure to communicate, either by failing to answer messages or failure to
                participate in team meetings. We understand that some students hold jobs in
                addition to school, but there are many ways to have virtual group meetings and
                contribute without physically meeting
             refusing to compromise
             doing all the work yourself and not accepting team member contributions
Note: If your lab partner does not contribute to an assignment, you should 1) not allow
him or her to sign the cover sheet, 2) report him or her immediately to the TA and/or lab
director, and 3) evaluate him or her appropriately on the peer evaluation. Note below that
all lab partners must agree that the slacker partner needs to be penalized.
Contribute appropriately to team writing assignments. A student who does not contribute
his/her share to an assignment will incur a penalty for that grade. The penalty will be based on
degree of lack of contribution and can range from 5-100% of grade. In order for this penalty to


be enforced, all lab partners of the slacker student must agree on lack of contribution. However,
if a student receives multiple “bad” peer evaluations, the lab director may override the lab
partner agreement policy. The penalty will be decided by the lab director, based on lab partner
input and inability of the student to demonstrate contribution.
Conversely, if the student does not accept input from his/her team members and this is apparent
from the peer evaluations, he or she will incur a 20% penalty, calculated as described above.
The penalized grade will be calculated by taking the team’s grade on the assignment and
multiplying by 0.8. For example, the team’s R&D grade is an 85. Difficult Student then gets 85 ×
0.8 = 68.
Also, we reserve the right to subtract up to 10% from the final average for students who have a
lab history of not contributing, despite what was put on the cover sheets. We also reserve the
right to fail students who fail to participate in the final project or the final case study and
presentation.
Submit work on time and in the proper format. The week-by-week schedule in the lab
manual shows you what is due and when it is due. Peer evaluations are also listed on the
schedule. CLOSING DATES WILL NOT BE EXTENDED JUST BECAUSE YOU FORGOT
TO COMPLETE AN ASSIGNMENT ON TIME! Failure to complete a peer evaluation on time
may mean a 0 for that grade.
Homework is due at the beginning of the lab period. It is considered late if it is not in the TA’s
possession by ten minutes after the start of lab. Papers that are turned in later in the lab period
will be penalized 5%. Papers turned in after the lab period will be penalized 10% of the total
point value for each day or partial day the report is late. Extensions will be granted only for
exceptional circumstances, such as a documented illness or death in the family. THE USUAL
LOAD OF ACADEMIA IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE REASON FOR AN EXTENSION.
All lab reports must be typed, double-spaced unless otherwise specified. Graphs must be
computer-generated. We may also require that lab reports be submitted through SafeAssign or
another plagiarism prevention application. Any questions about grading must be raised
within one week of getting the work back. No re-grades are possible after that time. Grading
disputes between the student and TA will be resolved by the course director.
Write effectively. Clear writing is an extremely important skill. Your TA and the course
director are available to answer specific questions about writing lab reports. However, we cannot
be expected to correct long-standing writing deficiencies. You are encouraged to take your
papers to the Undergraduate Writing Center for FREE assistance with writing skills, particularly
if English is not your native language. Substandard writing will not be accepted and may be
returned for revision without grading.
Be prepared and get assistance if necessary. It is important that you come to lab fully
prepared to do the exercise assigned for that week, with the lab manual on hand. You should
know not only what equipment you will be using, but how to use it, what you will be measuring,
and why. You should arrive at lab prepared to begin immediately, knowing the material well


enough to ace a quiz over it!
In addition, please realize that the labs at the beginning of the course emphasize skills that are
necessary for the rest of the semester, such as statistics and graphing and use of the data
acquisition system. Learn these skills while they are the focus, as later in the semester we will
assume that you have mastered them. Uncorrected problems in these areas can make this class a
painful experience, so ASK FOR HELP.
This is an upper division course and it is your responsibility to ask for help if you are having
difficulty. Your TA and the course director are both available during office hours and by email to
assist you or suggest another source of assistance. If you have personal problems that interfere
with your performance, please inform us of them in a timely fashion. If you experience serious
problems with your lab team members, you should tell us in addition to reporting the problem in
the peer evaluation.
ASSESSMENT
GRADING. Most grades in this class will be TEAM grades. The grade assigned to the team
will be the grade for each individual in the team – no exceptions. If you feel that someone in the
team did not cooperate or did not do his/her share of the work, you should use the peer
evaluation part of the class to indicate this. See the section on peer evaluation. In addition, if the
problem is extreme, you should comment directly to your TA and the course director.

69.5-72.5 = C-, 72.6-76.4 = C, 76.5 -79.4 = C+
59.5 -62.5 = D-, 62.6 – 66.4 = D, 66.5 – 69.4 = D+             < 59.5 = F


GENERAL LAB RULES & INFORMATION
1. No food or drink in the lab except in designated experiments.
2. LAPTOP OR CELL PHONE use in lab is only at the discretion of the teaching assistant.
3. Labs are messy and may involve the use of chemicals that will bleach or stain clothing. Dress
appropriately – if you treasure a particular item of clothing, don’t wear it to lab.
4. Be on time to the lab.
5. A first aid kit with Band-Aids etc. is available in the lab. If you cut yourself, please try to put
on your own Band-Aid. If you must assist someone who is bleeding, please observe precautions
and PUT ON GLOVES. Wipe up any blood and dispose of bloody towels, wipes, etc. in a
biohazard box.
6. Participation in experiments where the student in the subject is strictly voluntary. If you have
any medical condition that might put you or others at risk if you participate, do not volunteer.
7. Ladies’ room is in the east wing of PAI third floor. Men’s rooms are on floors 2 and 4.
ACADEMIC DISHONESTY
Academic dishonesty (cheating) will not be tolerated in any form. The most common form of
academic dishonesty is plagiarism and unauthorized collusion. Also, note that it is academic
dishonesty to misuse the class materials, such as sharing them on the Internet. See last paragraph
in this section for further information.
Copying or paraphrasing someone else's work, whether a published paper, web page, or lab
report, in whole or in part, is considered academic dishonesty. So is falsifying data. All written
work you turn in must be your own, in your own words. Lab reports that have identical
written material or that are substantially the same (i.e. occasional words added, deleted, or
changed) will be considered a scholastic violation and will be reported to the Dean of
Students as such.
You may work with your lab team except in those experiments designated as individual
assignments. This means that you may share the work of doing data calculations and you may
discuss the interpretation of the data with your lab team, but any written work must be entirely
your own. Using someone else's data without permission of the instructor is not permitted.
Copying or paraphrasing material from another source, including the lab manual, without
acknowledging the source is academic dishonesty. Word-for-word quotations placed in quotation
marks are rarely used in scientific writing and therefore are not appropriate in this class. If you
use outside materials, you must paraphrase them and cite them at the end of the lab report.
The penalties for cheating range from a zero on the assignment or test to an "F" in the course.
Academic dishonesty includes (but is not limited to) cheating on exams and quizzes, altering


tests after they have been returned, and failing to cite references or plagiarizing from references
used in the case studies.
It is highly recommended that you read the site on academic integrity, published by the Dean of
Students:
         http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/academicintegrity.html
         http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis_plagiarism.php

         http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/students/writing/plagiarism.pdf
         A Guide to Avoiding Plagiarism - LBJ School of Public Affairs
Students who violate the academic dishonesty rules will be called to a meeting with their
teaching assistant and the course director. If the students dispute the facts upon which the charge
is made or if they desire a hearing, the matter will be referred to the office of the Dean of
Students. If the students do not dispute the facts upon which the violation is based, they will sign
a written waiver of the hearing procedure and will be assigned a zero for the material in question.
In all cases where an academic penalty is assigned, a Faculty Disposition form, signed by the
student, will be filed with the Dean of Students.
USE OF CLASS MATERIALS: The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to,
exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized
copying of the class materials is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions
being taken against the student. Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific,
express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and
an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action. This includes,
among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those
materials with other current or future students.
MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION
Academic accommodations. Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
Students with Disabilities, 471-6259, http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd. You should
give us your letter no later than 7 days after classes start.
Religious holidays. By UT Austin policy, you must notify us in writing of your pending
absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must
miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy
day, you have an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the
absence.


Emergency evacuation (from the Office of Campus Safety and Security)
       -    Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required
     to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
                             requires exiting and assembling outside.
         -   Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may
  occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
                                             building.
        -    Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing
                                  during the first week of class.
       -    In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
        -    Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
      Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention
                                          Services office
