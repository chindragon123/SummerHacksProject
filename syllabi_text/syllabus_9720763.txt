Assignments. Assignments will be posted on Canvas in the relevant class module
approximately one week before their respective due dates. All assignments must be
completed independently by each student (i.e., assignments are not group projects).
CLASS PARTICIPATION AND CONTRIBUTION. IT IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO ATTEND CLASS,
BUT THAT YOU ALSO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE. ADVANCE PREPARATION IS CRITICAL TO DO THIS
SUCCESSFULLY. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ, ANALYZE, AND THINK ABOUT
ASSIGNED READINGS BEFORE COMING TO CLASS. FIFTY (50) points will be based on my largely
subjective assessment of your cumulative participation and contribution (read carefully the
grading criteria below).
Additionally, there may be periodic assignments and quizzes to help ensure your
understanding of the course material.
Criteria to earn points for class participation and contribution:
         Ask and answer questions and offer insights DURING CLASS DISCUSSIONS
         Actively participate in discussions led by guest speakers
         Submit written questions to me in advance (VIA E-MAIL NO LATER THAN NOON ON
          THE SATURDAY BEFORE CLASS) for guest speakers
         Post questions and insights to Canvas discussion forums
         Answer others’ posts to Canvas discussion forums
         Post sample test questions to exam discussion forums based on class presentations
          (NO LATER THAN ONE WEEK PRIOR TO SCHEDULED EXAMS)
 Both classroom and Canvas participation are important. However, TO EARN ALL OF THE
 POINTS AVIALBLE, SUBSTANTIVE CLASSROOM PARTICIPATION IS REQUIRED.
 Attendance also will be considered in determining your participation and contribution score.
 If at any point you have a concern about your performance in the course, please make
 arrangements to discuss your concerns with me. I will be happy to provide suggestions on
 how you might improve your performance.
                                      Canvas Discussion Forums
 You are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the Canvas discussion forums. Postings
 can relate to class discussions, assignments, exams, or other topics/issues that are relevant
 to this course. Substantive Canvas discussion forum participation will be part of your class
 participation and contribution grade.
 Canvas discussion forum ground rules:
         For questions or comments of general interest to the class (i.e., non-personal matters),
          please use the discussion forums, not e-mail. I will not consider personal e-mails to me
          in assigning class participation and contribution grades.
         Such electronic forums are commonly used in business environments so this will
          provide you with an opportunity to practice professional business communication skills.
          Be relevant, constructive, respectful and concise.
         Add your own insights and contributions and be responsive to comments posted by
          others.
         Access the discussion forums frequently, including before each class, assignment due
          dates and exams. I will also use the discussion forums to communicate important
          announcements and clarifications.

         Special Canvas discussion forums will be established for each exam and assignment.
          Please use such forums for assignment and exam related questions, not e-mail.
                                        Student ISACA Memberships
      You are encouraged to become student members of the Information Systems Audit and
      Control Association (ISACA). Joining ISACA provides access to a wealth of resources
      about the topics we will cover in class. With student membership, you gain access to
      articles in the Information Systems Control Journal, various IT audit & security toolkits,
      discounts on ISACA certifications (CISA, CISM), events, conferences, etc. Joining ISACA
      will also enable making connections with professionals around the world who are currently
      working and hiring for positions ranging from IT security, audit, control, risk, privacy,
      compliance and advisory services. To learn more, please check out
      www.isaca.org/student.
                           Policy on Missed Examinations and Assignments
 Medical emergencies, family emergencies and university-sponsored conflicts are the ONLY
 valid reasons for missing an examination or due date of an assignment. In any such instance,
 supporting documentation will be required, such as a signed note from a physician. At that
 point, I will decide the best make-up alternative on a case-by-case basis, which could mean a
 make-up exam or assignment. Examinations or assignments that are missed for reasons
 other than emergencies or university-sponsored conflicts will generally receive no credit. In
 the case of a university-sponsored event, you must notify me as soon as you are aware of the
 conflict and before the examination date or assignment due date. Interviews, recruiting
 events and office visits are not valid reasons for missing an examination or turning in
 an assignment late.
                                            Religious Holidays
 Religious holidays sometime conflict with examination and assignment schedules. If you miss
 an examination or assignment due date for the observance of a religious holy day, you will be
 given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence.
 It is the policy of the University that you must notify me at least fourteen (14) days prior to
 the exam or assignment due date that you will be absent to observe a religious holiday.
                               University Electronic Mail Notification Policy
 Students should become familiar with The University’s official e-mail student notification
 policy. It is the student’s responsibility to keep The University informed as to changes in his or
 her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in
 order to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain
 communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily. The
 complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your email address are available at:
 http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html.
                                          ACADEMIC HONESTY
Accounting Department Policy:
The Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibility of both students and faculty with respect to scholastic dishonesty are described

in detail in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty in the MPA Program. I
have agreed to observe all of the faculty responsibilities described in that document. By
enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all of the student responsibilities described
in that document. If the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is
unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
The student responsibilities embodied in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic
Dishonesty are consistent with the GSB Honor Code and the University’s General Information
catalog. However, you should obtain and read the department’s Policy Statement to ensure
that you understand my responsibilities.
                                       Students with Disabilities

                                                 Privacy
Password-protected class sites will be available for all accredited courses taught at The
University. Syllabi, handouts, assignments and other resources are types of information that
may be available within these sites. Site activities could include exchanging e-mail, engaging
in class discussions and chats, and exchanging files. In addition, class e-mail rosters will be a

                                             Campus Safety
Please note the following recommendations regarding The University of Texas at Austin
Campus Safety and Security, (512) 471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/:
               Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required
                 to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or
                 announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
               Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may
                 occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used
                 when entering the building.
               Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform their instructor in
                 writing during the first week of class.
               In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
               Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions to do so by the following:
                 Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or
                 Fire Prevention.
               The Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): (512) 232-5050 should be used to
                 report any behavioral concerns.
