                           Yeh masā’il-e tasawwuf yeh terā bayān ghālib
                          Tujhe ham walī samajhte jo nah bādahkhār hotā
                                                 (Mirza Asadullah Khan “Ghalib,” 1797-1869)
                 These questions of mysticism; this exposition of yours, O Ghalib
                    I would consider you a saint—if you weren’t a wine-drinker
Committed to a comparative study of Islamic mystical traditions, this seminar will explore the
major issues that scholars face when encountering histories, ideologies, aesthetics and literary
endeavors concerning “esoteric” Islam. While reflecting on the methodologies that shape mystical
discourses, we will ask questions relevant to the literary genres and ideological orientations that
have informed the category of Sufism. For instance, do we read the poetic verses of Jalaluddin
Rumi with the assistance of the same grounding principles that we use to read Muhammad Iqbal’s
Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam? How do the shared understandings of cross-lingual
sufferings acquire concrete written and aural forms across regional and temporal zones? Our topics
will also include the place of the political in the constitution of the spiritual; the role of gender and
sexuality in the formation of the Sufi canon; and the invocation of Sufism as a byword for an Islam
that eludes this-worldly politics.
