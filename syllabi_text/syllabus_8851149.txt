Purpose of Course:
The purpose of the class is to develop your ability to understand how U.S. tax law
analyzes transactions involving investment in real estate assets and securities. The
class is divided into five parts: (1) An introduction to the federal income tax; (2) a review
of taxation of real estate acquisitions, operations and dispositions; (3) a study of the
legal entities through which most real estate investments are made; (4) examination of
the principal real estate investment securities (REITs and REMICs); and (5) other
significant real estate tax issues (including investments by foreigners, tenancies-in-
common and like-kind exchanges).
Class Schedule
Wednesday, October 10 will be HAT DAY. Everyone must wear a hat to class.
There will be no class on Wednesday, October 24 or Monday November 20.
Part of the class on Monday, October 2 will be devoted to a session on preparing the
Practice Memorandum assigned that morning. This practice memo will be due on
Thursday, October 5.
Course Materials
The course materials will include of readings in Rosenfeld, Principles of Real Estate
Accounting and Taxation. There will be other materials, all available in the course
packet available at the McCombs COPY CENTER on the Third Floor in GSB.
Classroom Deportment
Cell phones must be turned off while you are in class. You may NOT use laptops in
class. Beverages are OK, but no food in class.
Evaluation and Grades
I will determine your final grade on the basis of your class participation and the two
memorandum assignments, each to be weighted equally. There will be no exams.
                                                1


Reading Assignments
The tax issues involved in real estate transactions are sometimes difficult and complex,
even in a summary course such as this one. Moreover, the knowledge in classes 1, 2
and 3 will form the base for understanding the material in classes 4, 5, and 6, and so on.
You cannot fall behind in these assignments
Written Assignments
There will be two written assignments in the form which you, as professionals, would
prepare for clients or employers. The memorandum assignments will be given to
you on Monday, October 22 and Thursday December 6, respectively, and you will
have 4 days to turn them in.
Class Participation
Since every professional must be able to communicate any thoughts and analysis, I
expect every student to participate regularly in our class discussion. There will be no
exceptions; you cannot succeed in this course unless you are prepared every day
to recite in class. It is far more important for each student to make efforts than to get
the “right” answer. As professionals, all of the knowledge in the world will accomplish
nothing unless it is coupled with the ability to express it clearly and to discuss it with your
peers. I will grade each student each day on participation.
Missed Assignments and Attendance
You will be excused from turning in work timely if you are deceased or if you become a
parent during the semester. I am willing to entertain other excuses, but don’t get your
hopes up. A similar policy applies to taking an “incomplete” for the course.
Scholastic Dishonesty--Departmental Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty. The
Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are
described in detail in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty. By
teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all the faculty responsibilities described in
that document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all the student
responsibilities described in that document. If the application of that Policy Statement to
this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for
clarification.
Professional Conduct. The highest professional standards are expected of all
members of the McCombs community. The collective class reputation and the value of
the Texas experience hinges on this.
Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request
appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more
information, you may call the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
