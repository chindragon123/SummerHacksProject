                           AFRICAN AMERICAN RELIGIONS
Course Description:
This course is an introduction to the study of African American religion. It surveys the
history and variety of religion as practiced by Americans of African descent, while giving
attention to the social construction of African religion, black religion, and the black church,
within the cultural context of the United States. The course also addresses attempts by
African Americans to overcome religion, situating these efforts within secular traditions in
the United States. The course is organized roughly chronologically, moving from the earliest
years of the European-African slave trade and transmission of African cultures to the
Americas, to the role of religion during antebellum slavery in the United States, to religious
movements during industrialization, and religious restructuring within service economies of
the late twentieth century to the present. In addition to numerically dominant Protestant
Christianity, the course surveys the presence of Judaism, Catholicism, and Islam within
African American religious history.
Course Goal:
By the end of this course, students should be able to think, discuss, and write critically about
African American religions from a religious studies perspective. Students should be able to
identify a range of African religious traditions within the history of the United States, be able
to construct a broad historical narrative of African American religions, and situate
contemporary examples of African American religious practice within this narrative.
Prerequisites: None. This course assumes no prior knowledge of the subject.
