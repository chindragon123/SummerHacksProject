                          Prosecutor Internship Syllabus
                                          Summer 2019
                                  Course Number 78540
Purpose and scope of the course.
         The purpose of this course is to educate students on the law and legal issues unique to criminal
prosecution, and to familiarize the students with the unique duties and responsibilities of a criminal
prosecutor not as simply an advocate, but as a minister of justice. The course is intended to be
cumulative with other criminal procedure courses, and to help the students take theory and learn how it
applies in a courtroom setting.
         The course will meet this objective by offering students an intensive course on criminal
prosecution, coupled with exposure to practical application of theory through observation and work in
the Travis County District Attorney’s Office. The academic portion of the course will be taught by the
adjunct professors and some of the most respected and experienced prosecutors, criminal defense
attorneys, and judges in the state. The clinical portion of the course will operate under the direction of
the adjunct professors, and the students will be directly supervised by assistant district attorneys.
         Students will assist the supervising prosecutors in a variety of tasks including legal research, trial
preparation, witness interviews and pre-trial motions. Students will spend a majority of their time in the
courtroom both observing and assisting with daily dockets and contested hearings including court and
jury trials.
         At the end of the course, students will have acquired an understanding of the functions of a
criminal district court from the perspective of a public prosecutor, including pleas, various motions, trial
before the court, and trial before a jury. The students will also have in-depth experience in preparing a
case for trial. The students will be introduced to some of the unique areas of criminal law, such as search
and seizure and discovery practice. Each student will have the opportunity to develop their skills in oral
advocacy in the context of mock exercised in opening statement, motions to suppress, direct and cross
examination, and jury selection. Finally, the students will gain a deep appreciation for the unique ethical
duties and responsibilities of a public prosecutor.
Prerequisites, grading policy, and assessment of student performance.
         This course is open to students who have completed their first year, with limited enrollment
through an application process. If third-year students have a third-year bar card, they will be
encouraged to participate in court proceedings to the extent they are prepared to do so and the
opportunity arises.
         Attendance to classes is mandatory. The class is pass/fail. Students will satisfy the requirements
of the course with full attendance and participation in class sessions, and satisfactory completion of the
requisite number of internship hours. There is no final exam.
         The students will be assessed by their supervising attorney for timely and diligent completion of
assignments. In addition, students will participate in four mock courtroom exercises during the
                                                                                                              1


semester, and will be immediately evaluated on preparation and execution of those exercises. (No prior
mock trial experience is required.) Half way through the semester the instructors will meet individually
with the students to assure that the student’s court assignment and work load is appropriate and
progress is satisfactory, and to evaluate their office work and their level of classroom participation.
         The University of Texas provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at

Course syllabus.
         The academic portions of the course will focus on legal areas and issues that commonly confront
trial prosecutors. The classroom instruction is divided into general topic areas. To give a perspective on
the different issues, the class will follow both active cases and recently-tried cases during the semester.
The reading outlined in the syllabus is important to your understanding of the issues discussed in class
and those you will face in your work at the district attorney’s office. The additional reading is not
required, but may be helpful.
         The following syllabus outlines the 10-week course. The classroom sessions are 2 hours long.
We will normally begin with a 15 to 30-minute opening discussion of issues that may have arisen during
the week surrounding the work and experience of the students in the courtroom environment. The next
hour and one half will be a substantive lecture on the topic or topics of the week, as well as a discussion
of the particular case or cases that are being followed by the class.
Course materials and readings.
         The students will be provided course materials by email and during the semester as needed for
future classes. Students will need access to a current Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure which
are readily available at the district attorney’s office or the bookstore. The syllabus below lists reading
that should be completed before class, along with additional reading materials if the student seeks more
on the subject matter to be discussed.
Where and when.
         Class is every Wednesday evening from 5:30 to 7:20, beginning June 12. The class will meet
most evenings at the District Attorney’s Office, room 464 in the Ronald Earle Building. Courtroom
exercises may take place either in the Blackwell-Thurman courthouse or in the Ronald Earle Building.
