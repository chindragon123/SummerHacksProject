Course Description
This graduate seminar course provides students with a basic understanding of the principles,
methods, and techniques in conducting scholarly and professional research in advertising,
marketing, and social sciences. Students will be introduced to the most common quantitative and
qualitative research methods and techniques in the fields, and learn the practice of planning and
executing advertising/marketing research by conducting a semester-long research project in a
small group.
Course Objectives
By the end of this semester, students will be able to:
    1. understand how research is practiced in advertising, marketing, and social sciences.
    2. evaluate and choose research methods appropriate to their research interests, and
    3. execute a research project including data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and
        reporting.
Required Course Materials

Instructional Approach
The format of this course combines lecture with active discussion/participation. Students are
expected to complete assigned readings prior to each class meeting in order to actively
participate.
Course Requirements
                  Exams (Exam 1: 10%; Exam 2: 15%; Exam 3: 5%; 30% in total)
There will be two in-class exams and one take-home exam scheduled during the semester. They
will cover materials presented in lectures, textbook and journal-article readings, in-class
exercises and class discussion. The format for the in-class exam will be a combination of
multiple-choice and short-answer questions. They are to be taken at the scheduled times and
locations. If you are unable to take the exam at the scheduled time and location, you need to
notify me at least two weeks prior to the exam. Failure to take any of the in-class exams on
time will result in the grade of F.
                              “Everyday Research” Assignments (15%)
Students will practice a research method or come up with an original research question based on
assigned readings. Selected assignments will be reviewed and discussed in class. Due dates may
vary; check each assignment for its due date. You may submit 6 assignments, and your
highest 5 assignments will count. More information will be given in class.
                                          Paper Critique (5%)
In a small group, students will take turns presenting a critique of an advertising research article
(available in the Readings folder). The team responsible for a given article is expected to
distribute a handout that summarizes the key points of the presentation and conduct a 10-
minute oral presentation of the article in class, followed by a 5-minute Q&A session. Your
handout and PPT should include: (a) correct identification of research question, method, and
results, (b) detailed description of the research method used, and (c) detailed methodological
critique of the study.
See the handout for guidelines, and check the example work on CANVAS. Paper critique
submissions are due by 24 hours before the scheduled presentation at http://canvas.utexas.edu/.
You are required to set up a meeting with your TA to discuss your presentation in advance.
                            Consumer Survey/Experiment Project (40%)
Each group will come up with a research question related to advertising. You will design an
online survey or experiment on Qualtrics, collect and analyze data using PSPP
(https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/get.html), write a report of findings and perform an oral
presentation for the class. Your grade will be based on the following assignments. Failure to
submit the final report on time will result in the grade of F:
 1) Research proposal (7%)
 2) Online questionnaire (4%)
 3) Final presentation (6%)
 4) Final report (20%)
 5) Anonymous peer review (3%)
                                                   2


                           Attendance (6%) and Class participation (4%)
This is a graduate seminar class, so I expect you to attend class regularly and participate in
discussion actively. Late arrivals will be noted by your TA and will affect your attendance grade.
If you don’t ever speak up in class and/or are not prepared for discussions, then you will not
receive much credit for the class participation section. Texting, checking email/Facebook, or
any other activity other than taking notes in class will decrease 1% on your final grade for
each time this happens. You are responsible for any assignments given and all work missed
when absent or late.
Late Work Policy
As a general rule, I accept late work, but you will automatically lose 50% of your score. No
late work will be accepted for the final report and Exam 3. Software, network or storage
device failure is not a valid excuse for late work. No assignment will be accepted two weeks past
the due date.
Course Evaluation
Your final grade will be determined by the following:

Grading Scale
You can estimate your grade using the following scale; the scale may change depending on how
the entire class performs:
A = 94-100 %
A- = 90-93 %
B+ = 87-89 %
B = 84-86 %
B- = 80-83 %
C+ = 77-79 %
C = 74-76 %
C- = 70-73 %
D or F = below 69 %
                                                  3

Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php)
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning
process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and
submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and
must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and
readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Policy on Religious Holy Days Observance
(http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi03-04/ch4/ch4g.html#attendance)
The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student
from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of
a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under
this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an
examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable
time after the absence.
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence
as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable
time after the absence.
Students with Disabilities (http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd)
Please notify your instructor of any modification/adaptation you may require to accommodate a
disability-related need. You will be requested to provide documentation to the Dean of Student's
Office in order that the most appropriate accommodations can be determined. Specialized
services are available on campus through Services for Students with Disabilities.
