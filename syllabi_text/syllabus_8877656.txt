Description
         The AIDS pandemic is still far from over. This course explores the historical and
contemporary phenomenon of HIV/AIDS principally in the art and activism of the
African Diaspora. For over three decades we as a species have been using activism and
artistry to champion the cause, mourn the dead, prevent infection and encourage healthy
HIV+ lives. Here in the United States, in the American South, and at UT, we are part of a
global movement of contagiously creative and infectiously passionate people determined
to honour, preserve and celebrate life in this age of AIDS. Throughout the semester, we
will gather local and international resources, tools and strategies vital for our global well-
being.
*Please Note:
1) This course carries a flag for Global Cultures.
2) This course deals with aspects of gender, sex, sexuality, and HIV/AIDS in a candid and explicit
manner at times. Students who do not feel comfortable with this approach should not take the
course. If you choose to take this course, you have agreed to respect our classroom as a safe
space. Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia or poz-phobia of any sort will not
be tolerated.
Requirements & Assignments
1. Attendance: Each student is required to attend every class session. Unexcused
absences are unacceptable. More than one unexcused absence during the term will result
in a reduction of the overall course grade for each session missed (AàA-, B+àB, etc.).
*Note: The use of laptops and mobile phones is NOT permitted in the classroom
 2. Informed participation: Each student will complete the assigned readings and bring
hardcopies of these readings to class. Students will come to class on time and prepared
with questions and comments on each reading.

     African & African Diaspora Studies                               University of Texas at Austin
3. Reading responses: Each week, students will post a one-page reading response by
5pm on the Monday before class. These posts are intended to provoke conversation.
The week’s assigned readings must be addressed directly, but no need to summarize.
Critique, compare, and pose questions for discussion or clarification. Each post must
comment on at least one other person’s reading response. The first reading response is
due on Monday 9/10 at 5pm. These responses will be graded on a credit/no credit basis.
Students will receive no credit for late posts.
4. Discussion facilitation: Each student will co-facilitate one class sessions. These
sessions will be assigned. Students may exchange dates, but must inform the professor of
this change at least one week prior to the facilitation. Facilitators are required to meet
with the instructor during office hours prior to each facilitation. Facilitators are expected
to draft questions for discussion based on the assigned readings and are required to read
the reading responses posted for that week. The inclusion of course-relevant audio/visual
material as a way to encourage conversation is highly encouraged. Students will receive a
grade for these facilitations. Discussion facilitators are NOT required to write reading
responses for the week of their facilitation.
5. Final project proposal: Students will be assigned final project groups (shifts are
allowed between groups, but the professor must be informed of these changes at least one
week before the proposal is due) and write a 2-3-page proposal (12pt. Times New
Roman font, double spaced) for a final project. This proposal will explain the form of the
final project and the texts the group will be using. These texts must include course related
readings/films, but may also include outside resources. This proposal will be
accompanied by a briefly annotated bibliography (the bibliography does NOT count
toward the minimum page limit). Each group member will receive the same grade.
6. Final project: Each group will complete a final project to be accompanied by a 5-7
page explanatory essay (12pt. Times New Roman font, double spaced). The project will
be due on the first day of Final Exams. Each group members will receive the same grade.
   •   For the Final Project students will produce a creative work in the medium of their
       choice (performance, film, painting, sculpture, photography, literary text, web, etc.
       or using multiple media). This work MUST engage directly with texts/films
       assigned for the course and themes raised by the course. Outside sources are
       encouraged but not required.
Please note for all assignments:
* Late proposals and projects will be penalized for every day they are late (i.e. A à A-
if one day late, A à B+ if two days late, etc.). Students are required to proofread their
material prior to submission (ideally, someone else will also read the material for
grammatical/spelling/flow errors your eyes might miss). Materials that show evidence of
not having been proofread will be returned and marked late. Extensions may be
considered only under extenuating circumstances and in emergency situations. When
possible, advance notice is encouraged and documentation will be required.

Grading Schema
(Informed by “Grading Standards II” by Maxine Rodburg of the Harvard Writing Center)
The following are the standards I adhere to when I grade essays. Pluses and minuses
represent shades of difference, as do split grades (e.g. B-/C+). I assign grades on the
evidence of the essay submitted, not on effort or time spent.

A:    An excellent piece of writing (this is not the same as perfect). This is an
      ambitious, perceptive essay that grapples with interesting, complex ideas,
      responds discerningly to counter-arguments, and explores well-chosen evidence
      revealingly. The discussion enhances— rather than underscores— the reader’s
      and writer’s knowledge (it doesn’t simply repeat what has been discussed in
      class). There is a context for all the ideas; someone outside the class would be
      enriched, not confused, by reading the essay. Its beginning opens up— rather than
      flatly announces— its thesis. Its end is something more than a summary. The
      language is clean, precise, and often elegant. As a reader I feel surprised,
      delighted, changed. There’s something new here for me, something only the
      essay’s writer could have written and explored in this particular way. The writer’s
      stake in the material is obvious.
B:    This is a piece of writing that reaches high and achieves many of its aims. The
      ideas are solid and progressively explored but some thin patches require more
      analysis and/or some stray thoughts do not quite fit together well. The language is
      generally clear and precise but occasionally not. The evidence is relevant, but
      there may be too little. The context for the evidence may not be sufficiently
      explored, so that I have to make some of the connections that the writer should
      have made clear for me.
      OR This is a piece of writing that does not reach as high than an ‘A’ essay, but
      thoroughly achieves its aims. This is a solid essay whose reasoning and argument
      may nonetheless be rather routine— in this case the limitation is conceptual.
C:    This is a piece of writing that has real problems in one of these areas: 1)
      conception (there is at least one main idea but it is obscure and hard to get to); 2)
      structure (the logic behind the ordering of the text is far from clear); 3) use of
      evidence (there is no evidence presented or that which is provided is weak and/or
      the connections among the ideas are unclear or without context; the text is
      plagued by generalizations and absent substantial proof); 4) language (the writing
      is awkward and generally stands in the way of comprehension). Overall, the essay
      may be repetitive, poorly organized, and/or superficial in its treatment of the
      subject matter. In addition, punctuation, spelling, grammar, citations, and
      transitions may be problems as well.
      OR This is an essay that largely summarizes any given text or other work (of art
      or analysis), but is written without too many major problems.
      OR This is an essay that is chiefly a personal reaction to something. This is
      perhaps well written, but there is scant engagement with course content or other
      scholarly material; it is mostly opinion.
D:  This is an essay that demonstrates very little effort to grapple seriously with the
      ideas it hopes to explore.

      OR This is a piece of writing that is extremely problematic in many of the areas
      mentioned above: conception, structure, use of evidence, language, etc.
      OR This is writing that does not come close to meeting the expectations of the
      assignment.
F:    This is a piece of writing that should most definitely be re-conceptualized and
      revised drastically so that it can be re-submitted if that option is available.
