                                                                                             FALL 2019
   Description:        Major professional and amateur sports exist today as very large businesses.
                       The rights to broadcast games, matches, races and events are sold for
                       billions of dollars and the revenues they generate underpin the entire sports
                       ecosystem globally. Indeed, the value of many sports properties are in fact
                       tied almost entirely to their league and local media rights deals. Sports today
                       is a media business.
                       The course is designed to provide students with a basic understanding of how
                       the business of sports media operates both as a business generating revenue
                       and content and as a provider and disseminator of information, critique, and
                       entertainment. The course will be primarily lecture and discussion of key
                       topics and issues involved with the business of sports media with various
                       guest speakers from sports\media entities that have an impact in this area.
                       This course will examine the many facets of the business of sports related
                       media including over the air television, cable, satellite TV, OTT platforms,
                       digital, print, radio, and social media. It examines the business models that
                       each of these types of media use, the challenges to such models, the
                       changes that are likely in the future and the impact of such media on sports
                       presentation and development, professional franchises, colleges and
                       conferences and the consumer. It will trace the historical development of
                       sports as social phenomenon and the essential role that media has played in
                       shaping and building its role in domestic society and international relations.
   Objectives:         The student who successfully completes this course will ideally be able to:
       1. Understand the reasons for the growth of sports as key part of American society and
          culture, and the central role that media has played in that growth.
       2. Apply basic terminology and fundamental theories/principles of the sports and sports
          media industries.
       3. Understand the key parties, relationships and business models in the sports media
          ecosystem
       4. Identify and understand the key role that sports and the media has played in American
          society.
       5. Understand how sports and the media can shape political discussion and political
          behavior
       6. Develop your own theories on the use of sports and the media as a means for future
          social change and the implications of such power and ability by these institutions.
COURSE OUTLINE
Approach:
   This course will be comprised of fifteen (14) sessions plus exam week with each individual
   session being approximately three hours (3.0) in length. Due to the length of each class, the
   course will be designed to include a mixture of lecture by the principal instructor and guests,
   group discussion, periodic quizzes and other in-class challenges.


                                                                  THE BUSINESS OF SPORTS MEDIA
                                                                             ADV 348S, PR 348S, J 348G
                                                                      SYLLABUS & COURSE OUTLINE
                                                                                                FALL 2019
Class Preparation:
    1. It is expected that each student will be prepared to participate in lively, intelligent and
         professional discussion. This includes listening respectfully to all.
    2. Reading assignments and homework must be done prior to attending class so that
         everyone will benefit from an in-depth discussion of issues.
    3. All written assignments are to be typed. Spelling, grammar, and punctuation must be of
         professional or business standard. You must use a recognized citation standard when
         referencing the works of others in your written submissions.
    4. All cell phones and pagers will be turned off prior to class. Laptops are permitted but such
         privileges may be rescinded in the discretion of the instructor if laptops are used for other
         than class use.
Attendance:
    Students are expected to attend every class which is critical to the success of the
    course. As noted below, a large part of your grade will come from in class activities. Students
    are to be prepared to start the class session on time.
    If for some reason you are unable to attend class, the student is expected to inform the
    instructor via email prior to class.
    Being absent or late for class may result in a reduction of your grade for the course. If a
    student misses a class for any reason, it is the responsibility of the student to be informed of
    the materials covered during the class. Each student is encouraged to find a “class buddy”
    who can share information, handouts, and assignments.
Academic Integrity and Standards:
    Students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity
    in all course activities and assignments. It is expected that there shall be no deception
    regarding the representation made by the student of his/her preparation, participation, or
    performance.
    Plagiarism is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgement makes the difference. Plagiarism is
    presenting another person’s work as though it is one’s own. Plagiarism is the presentation of a
    sequence of words, from another writer, quoted without quotation marks and presented as one’s
    own work. It is crucial that acknowledgement of sources be accurate and complete. This
    includes citations of all sources on written assignments. The instructor uses various tools to
    determine if plagiarism has occurred.
    The remainder of the course requirements and policies relating to cheating and plagiarism are
    subject to the standard policies and procedures for all UT-Austin students as established by UT-
    Austin.

                may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped
                courses, including any course a transfer student has dropped at another
                institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping
                more than that number.”

                                                                      SYLLABUS & COURSE OUTLINE
                                                                                             FALL 2019
Grading and Evaluation:
Grading is cumulative throughout the semester. Every point counts toward the final grade. Individual
assessment will be based on attainment of up to 100 points with the number of points assigned to
each means of grading and method of evaluation as listed below. These points may be modified
slightly over the course of the semester. For example, a point may be added to the Midterm and a
point subtracted from Quizzes. Point totals are as follows:
           Written Assignment (1)                                   08% (08 points)
           Case Studies (2)                                         14% (14 points)
           In Class Quizzes (5)                                     20% (20 points)
           Test (1)                                                 12% (12 points)
           Midterm Exam                                             18% (18 points)
           Final Exam                                               20% (20 points)
           Final Take Home question                                10% (10 points)
           Total Points:                                           102% (102 Points)
NOTE: DO NOT use the grade calculation function in CANVAS to assess your grade as it
does not take into account the different total point values of each graded item; it only
blends grade averages. To calculate your grade at any point in the class divide your RAW
point total by the total number of RAW points available in graded assignments to date. For
example, if 30 points worth of assignments have been graded and you have 27 points,
your current grade would be 90% (27/30).
A. Periodic Written Assignments and Case Studies. The specifics of each writing assignment will
be discussed in class and\or on Canvas but will generally be focused on current issues\news
involving sports media as presented in class, a formal business review case study, and/or the current
issue of the Sports Business Journal. Each assignment may require the student to consider outside
sources to perform an analysis of the question presented. An analysis is not a reiteration of the
remarks by the author. An analysis is a concise, cogent reflection clearly articulated and supported
with examples, and connected to course-related theories.
Format:
    1. These analyses may have different lengths, though none will exceed 750 words, maximum,
         appropriately referenced. Any content over the maximum limit will not be reviewed and
         the assignment will be graded on the maximum word count only.
    2. Students must provide a word count in writing at the conclusion of each question/assignment.
    3. Each writing submitted for credit in this class will be judged not only on reasoning and content
         but on the quality of the writing style and grammar as well.
    4. Late assignments may be turned in after discussion with and receipt of the approval of the
         instructor or the Teaching Assistant but the maximum grade that may be received for a late
         assignment is one half the credits.
    5. All such writings shall be submitted through Canvas, pasted into Canvas, NOT
         ATTACHED
    6. Grades will generally be posted to Canvas within two weeks of assignment submission by
         students.


                                                                  THE BUSINESS OF SPORTS MEDIA
                                                                            ADV 348S, PR 348S, J 348G
                                                                      SYLLABUS & COURSE OUTLINE
                                                                                               FALL 2019
B. In Class Quizzes. We will have five (5) periodic Quizzes in Class dealing with assigned
readings and SBJ weekly readings. Notice will not normally be given of such quizzes.
Additional details to be discussed in class.
C. Testing: The goal in this class is for students to learn the mechanics, operations and business
principals of sports media. Many of the topics are industry-specific and require students to learn
concepts to a detailed level AND provide analysis of current business situations. As such, our goal
is to provide a testing environment that allows students to properly compose their answers
and evidence they know the material. Therefore, in class testing WILL NOT BE TIMED – stay
until you finish.
1. Test (Definitional). Early class content covers historical context and the mechanics of
broadcasting, cable, satellite, etc. These straightforward “Definitional” concepts will be tested early in
the semester (Class 4) and provide an opportunity to form a solid baseline grade in the class.
2. Mid Term Exam (Definitional + Analytical). It will consist of a number of some combination of
multiple choice, true\false, short answer and similar type questions and will cover material assigned
and lectures given through the date of the exam.
3. Final Exam (Definitional + Analytical) – Held during the last class of the Semester. It will consist
of a number of some combination of multiple choice, true\false, short answer and similar type
questions and will cover material assigned and lectures given through the entire semester.
D. The Final Take Home Question. Students will be asked to draw upon the various course
readings, case studies, SBJ articles and other material used or assigned and in class discussions
and lectures to express an understanding of a topic or topics involving the business of sports media.
The final assignment will be multiple questions, each with a maximum of 300 words, appropriately
referenced. The standards set out above for Periodic Written Assignments shall apply here as
well.
E. Extra credit. Extra credit lectures or other extra credit opportunities may be available and will be
posted and\ or discussed in class.
    1. NOTE: You accumulate points over the course of the semester by completion of all of
        the above graded activities. Maximum points available equal 102 (plus any extra
        credit). If you miss any of the graded activities or fail to complete or submit them, the
        points associated with those activities are forfeited and as such, will impact your final
        grade.
    2. Class Participation & Overall Engagement: this is essential to highly effective
        learning. In appropriate cases, students may earn up to 2% (02 points).
    3. EXTRA CERDIT OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENTIRELY DISCRETIONARY; EXCESSIVE
        CLASS ABSENCES OR ANY INDICATION OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY WILL RESULT
        IN THE IMMEDIATE ZERO-ING OUT OF ALL POSSIBLE EXTRA CREDIT POINTS IN
        ADDITION TO ALL OTHER APPLICABLE PENALTIES.

PLEASE NOTE: due to the built-in 2 point curve and the extra-credit opportunities,
grades will not be additionally bootstrapped/rounded up. (e.g., a final raw point total of
92.7 will not be rounded up to a 93. Based on the above chart, it’s an A-).
Required Reading Materials
    1. There will be an initial Coursepak that is available for this course. It contains mandatory
         readings. It will be available by Monday, 3rd September, 2019 at Jenn’s on Dean Keeton
         and Guadalupe. Additional readings will be posted online and perhaps a second coursepak.
    2. Students will also be expected to familiarize themselves with current relevant news and
         events regarding the business sports media as news breaks. As such, it is strongly
         recommended that students read the New York Times, Washington Post, and the Wall Street
         Journal on an active basis.
    3. Further, The Sports Business Journal (SBJ) is a mandatory weekly read (starting in
         week 3) and is an invaluable source of current information. Details will be given about SBJ in
         class or in a posted Announcement in Canvas.
    4. We will begin using SBJ in the second week of class so you must subscribe or have SBJ
         available before your second class. Articles and material of current interest to a topic being
         discussed in class will be assigned periodically throughout the semester.

Course Plan
Important Note re: Class Prep/Readings:
We significantly reduce the amount of SYLLABUS LISTED course readings for the 2nd
half of the semester. Frankly, the industry is moving so fast and the topics are so
relevant and fast-evolving that we will be posting the readings closer to the semester
mid-way point. This may result in a second Coursepak, or a series of linked articles
(TBD).
We may also publish Links WEEKLY for the next class, so please check in regularly to
ensure you are up to date on course prep.
