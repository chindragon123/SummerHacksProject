This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with
writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester,
complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your
writing. You will also have an opportunity to revise one of your assignments, and to discuss your peers'
work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work.
Course Scope: A wandering pig played a central role in creating a bicameral legislature in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1644. According to John Winthrop, the colony’s first governor, “There fell
out a great business upon a very small occasion”: a poor widow and a wealthy merchant went to the
General Court regarding the disputed ownership of a stray sow. Although popular sympathies rested with
the widow, the Court ruled in favor of the merchant, thus prompting the Court’s assistants and deputies to
divide formally into two distinct legislative houses in order to make the colony’s government more
representative. This is but one example of the central—if hitherto unrecognized—role that animals have
played in shaping American history. Consequently, one of the goals of this interdisciplinary upper-division
undergraduate seminar is to explore the following question: What does the U.S. history survey look like if
we place animals at the center of our analysis? This class examines the place of animals—from fish to
elephants—in the social, cultural, literary, economic, and political life of America from the colonial period
to the present. Topics of discussion include animals in entertainment; hunting; vegetarianism; changing
cultural attitudes about nature; wandering animals and property rights; animals and evolutionary theory; the
rise of the animal welfare and animal rights movements; laboring animals and the nation’s move to a
motorized economy; the growth of pet keeping as a cultural practice and big business; factory farms; the
rise of veterinary science; and zoos.
We will combine our historical exploration of animals and American culture with direct, hands-on
experience with contemporary animals outside the classroom through the service learning component of the
course. You will complete 20 hours of service learning for the semester at the Austin Animal Center, 7201
Levander Loop, Austin, TX 78702: http://www.austintexas.gov/department/aac OR, at a service learning
location of your choice (after you have received my approval).
Class Format: This is a discussion seminar, but occasional classes will be devoted primarily to lecturing
and class presentations. Additionally, I will give occasional “mini” lectures to provide additional historical
context at pertinent moments of our discussion. Further, we will enhance our discussion with salient film,
music, television clips, and other media throughout the semester.
Course requirements: Mandatory class attendance, active participation in the class discussion; completion
of 20 hours of service learning during the semester; completion of in-class presentation during last 3 weeks
of the semester; and completion of all reading and writing assignments. The writing assignments include: a
service learning journal; and a final research paper that will be 10-12 pages in length.
Attendance Policy: Regular communication with your professor is critical to your success in college.
Consequently, if you are absent, you must contact me on the date that you have missed class AT THE
LATEST—either by telephone, or via email, or in person (if your absence is planned in advance). If you
follow this protocol, I will count your absence as “Excused.” If you fail to follow this protocol, your
absence will be counted as “Unexcused.” After THREE UNEXCUSED ABSENCES, I will penalize your
final grade by half a grade for each subsequent UNEXCUSED absence.

Class Discussion Format: Be prepared to discuss and analyze the significance of the reading assignment
for each class. Occasionally, we will break into smaller groups to analyze specific cultural objects in
relation to the reading assignments, lectures, and larger course themes. You will also engage in periodic
free-write sessions in small groups that you will share with your classmates as part of the discussion. In all
discussions, please be prepared to make historical connections across assignments and across historical
periods. In this spirit, we will make additional links to contemporary animal-related phenomena. Therefore,
we will begin each class with a short “Animals in the News” discussion. Please bring current news items to
enhance the day’s conversation.
Service Learning: You will complete 20 hours of service learning for the semester at the Austin Animal
Center (AAC), 7201 Levander Loop, Austin, TX 78702: http://www.austintexas.gov/department/aac.
AAC has a walk-in volunteer program—no appointment or prior orientation training is required—in which
one can walk and help socialize qualified “green dot” dogs on the facility grounds. AAC also offers
additional volunteering opportunities that require further training, which can be completed onsite at AAC.
For those students who are unable to complete onsite service learning activities owing to transportation
challenges or other logistical difficulties, there will be additional options for offsite service projects. Please
come and see me to discuss possible options. Alternatively, you may complete this course requirement at a
different animal-related location, such as: the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, 4801 La Crosse Ave,
Austin, TX 78739: https://www.wildflower.org; Travis Audubon Society, 3710 Cedar Street, Box 17,
Austin, TX 78705, Phone: 512-300-2473: https://travisaudubon.org, among others. Please contact these
organizations directly. They will likely have volunteer training requirements that you will have to complete
prior to starting your service learning.
Your service learning grade will be determined by the number of service learning hours you have
completed. If you complete 20 hours of documented service learning, you will receive 20 points, or full
credit, for this course requirement. DUE DATE: Begin during week of 2/17. Complete by 5/8/20.
Service Learning Journal: You will chronicle your experiences in a journal while you complete your
twenty hours of service learning. Each time you complete a one-hour or two-hour bloc, please write a one-
page descriptive and analytic reflection of your activities. Please document each entry with a date and time
of service, and then submit each entry to me. You will receive a credit grade for your journal. DUE DATE:
after each time you volunteer. Last day to submit: 5/8/20.
In-class Presentation of Research Project: During the last 3 weeks of class, you will present your research
project to our class. During your 10-12 minute presentation, you will provide an overview of your animal
incident; you will analyze its significance; and you will make broader historical connections to other
themes and events related to the history of animals. Your classmates and I will provide feedback on your


                                                                                                               3
presentation that you can use in crafting your final research paper. We will set up the presentation schedule
on April 6. DUE DATE: Last 3 weeks of class (4/20-5/6), per presentation schedule.
Final Research Paper Structure and Format: You will write a 10-12 page analytic essay that uses a
combination of primary and secondary sources to explore a specific incident-based facet of the history of
human and animal relationships of your choice. You must receive my permission for your chosen topic by
Monday, March 23.
Additional Requirements for Animal Incident Paper: Your essay must be logically organized and
supported by at least 10 sources. At least ONE of your sources must come from a book, preferably a print
edition. You must also include at least 5 primary sources (such as historical newspapers, magazines, and
photographs), either from digital sources, or—even better—drawn from UT’s extensive research libraries,
such as the Harry Ransom Center and the Briscoe Center for American History, among other locations.
Your notes and bibliography must conform to the standard style in humanities disciplines. Please see the
Chicago Manual of Style format for your citations, which will include endnotes:
http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html
The essay must be typed, double-spaced, with 1-inch margins, 12-point font, and numbered pages. You
should organize the essay in the following manner: 1) An INTRODUCTION, or an overview of your
animal incident, including a thesis statement, which tells your reader how will interpret the significance of
the subject matter of your essay 3) A BODY, comprised of evidence to support your thesis statement 4) A
CONCLUSION, which summarizes the body of the paper, reiterating (with different wording) and
substantiating the thesis statement. 5) A BIBLIOGRAPHY of your sources that follows your endnotes. I
will provide feedback on any draft of the final paper submitted to me by 4/27. DUE DATE: Monday,
May 11, 2020, by 2:00 PM; hard copy in BUR 437 and electronically by email to
janetmdavis@austin.utexas.edu.
