Attendance and participation in all classes is expected, but if you cannot make it to class,
there are consequences. Being consistently late to class is not cool and it will have a
negative impact on your grade. Also, assignments are due at the beginning of class and
there are consequences for turning in assignments after this time.

Computer Policy
Your computer is to stay closed unless otherwise indicated by the professor. Mobile phones
are not to be used in class. If there is an emergency, please leave the class.
Professionalism
This course is a preparation for employment in a studio. Therefore we expect you to act in
class as you would in the workplace. While studios are often informal, they still require
everyone to be respectful of others. Furthermore, attendance both for the class and when
your team meets are critical. How your teammates view the quality and quantity of your
work, as well as your team skills are important. Finally, how much work you produced, as
recorded in the agile development software, will be considered.
