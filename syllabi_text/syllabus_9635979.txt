   Grades:
   Your grades and class materials can be found on Canvas. It can be found at
   https://canvas.utexas.edu/. Grades are distributed as follows:
            Quizzes: 20%. Quizzes will be given on most Thursdays. Your two lowest quiz scores will
            be dropped. There will be no makeups for any reason.
            Midterms: 60%. There will be three midterms. I will replace your lowest midterm score
            with your final exam score, provided that this is to your benefit (i.e. your grade on the
            final exam is better than your lowest midterm score). Each midterm score will count for
            20% of your final grade. There will be no makeups or alternate midterm times for any
            reason. The dates of our midterms can be found on the lessons calendar, below.
            Final Exam: 20%. The final exam is worth 20%. There will be no makeups for any
            reason. There will be no alternate final exam times for any reason. To find information
            about the final exam, google UT Finals Schedule and enter the unique number of our
            class.
            Grade cutoffs: If the course is curved, the curve will not be known until after the final
            exam. You are guaranteed cutoffs that are standard (93­100 A, 90­92 A­, 87­89 B+,
            etc.) or better. Final grades are final and will not be changed. If you feel extenuating
            circumstances were deleterious to your grade in the course, please contact Student
            Emergency Services.
