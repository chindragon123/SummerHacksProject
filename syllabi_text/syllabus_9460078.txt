Attendance
Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class. You may miss
up to four class days (regardless of the reason for the absence) with no
penalty. For each additional absence beyond four absences, I will deduct 3
percentage points from your final grade. There is no exception to this policy. If you
do not plan to attend regularly, you should not take this class. Students who miss
class will be responsible for any material covered that day.
Late Work and Make-Up Policy
Late work will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Please communicate with me if
you are having problems keeping to the schedule. It is better to talk through
problems than ignore them.
Reading Quizzes. There are no make-ups for missed quizzes, but you can miss two
without penalty.
Discussion Questions. Make-ups for missed discussion questions are only offered
with proper documentation of a UT-sanctioned absence. Email me as soon as
possible to discuss.
Discussion Responses. There are no make-ups for missed discussion responses,
but you can skip two weeks without penalty.
Exams. Make-up exams are only offered with proper documentation of a UT-
sanctioned absence. Email me as soon as possible to discuss.
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop
before the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester.
Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any
public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
Religious Holy Days
UT Austin policy requires that you notify me of your pending absence at least
fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must
miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a
religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within
a reasonable time after the absence.

In accordance with departmental and university policies, I will not grant an

Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and
assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made.
Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
   Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building.
    Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you
    entered the building.
   If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week
    of class.
   In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class
    instructors.
   Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire
    Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services
    office.
  Academic Integrity
  The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery,
  freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each student in
  the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a
  student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of
  the University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously
  at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you
  have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be
  guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure
  of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty
  and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web

Counseling and Mental Health Center
All of us benefit from support during
times of struggle. You are not alone.
There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important
part of the college experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support
sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences
any academic stress, difficult life events,
or feelings like anxiety or depression, we               Credit: CollegeDegrees360
strongly encourage you to seek support.

                 Appendix: The Meaning of Grades
For students, the grading process can be a mystery. After completing your essay or
exam, it may seem that they are sent off to a place where grades magically appear
at random. I want to assure you that this is not the case. Just as you put time and
effort into completing your assignments and exams, I put time and effort into
grading them. This means that I do read every word of your essays, papers, and
exam answers. Whenever possible, I will have detailed grading rubrics that allow
me to deduct points in the same way from each student’s exam. In the case of
response essays, in which a specific grading rubric is not practical, the following
describes my view on what makes an answer worth each letter grade:
A       Work surpasses the requirements of an assignment by adding new insights,
        creativity, and/or particularly thoughtful analysis or applications. In “A”
        answers, students demonstrate a complete understanding of the course
        material, have clearly stated purposes, and support their ideas with
        examples when appropriate. Few changes, corrections, or suggestions can be
        made regarding the accuracy of information or the effectiveness of
        communication.
B       Work meets the requirements of the assignment. In “B” answers, students
        demonstrate a solid command of the course material, support their ideas
        with examples when appropriate, state their purposes, and apply concepts to
        another context if applicable. “B” work is clear and effective, has good
        organization, and has clearly expressed ideas.
C       Work partially meets the requirements of the assignment. In “C” answers,
        students demonstrate an acceptable command of the course material and a
        basic ability to apply concepts, support their ideas, and state their purposes.
        A “C” may indicate work that has some gaps and errors or communication
        that is inconsistent or difficult to follow.
D       Work marginally meets the requirements of the assignment and has many
        areas that need improvement. Often “D” work indicates an attempt to merely
        repeat the material from class discussions without further insight or
        consideration.
F       Work does not meet the requirements of the assignment. “F” work is
        consistently weak, reflecting little thought or effort.
