Course Description
We live in a rapidly changing business environment. Marketing concepts that were relevant in
the past are no longer pertinent in solving great managerial matters. The new media setting and
the internet have definitely changed the way business people think and create. Today’s market
demands more of a “renaissance professional” than just a “specialized” one. Accordingly, this
course brings forward the integrated way of thinking; self-entrepreneurship, the big picture
insight of the organization, its problems, challenges and solutions, all in the context of brand
promotion. This Class will combine Harvard Business Cases and entrepreneurship efforts, while
practicing creative, managerial, research and presentation skills. Students should expect a great
deal of independent work. Also, be prepared to start shifting yourself from “a student way of
thinking” towards a more “practical/ professional way of thinking.”
Overarching Goals and Objectives
    1) Intangible goals. This class has a unique structure. It offers an opportunity to develop: 1)
        your own creative way of thinking, while learning about decision making process, 2) who
        you are and what is important to you in the business setting, 3) sensitivity to worldly,
        business and ethical issues, and 4) communication skills and courage to express your
        ideas in a group dynamics and in front of an audience.
    2) Internalizing the Case method. In class, we will analyze “real life” business situations
        (aka, cases) that will prepare you as a professional in the field.
    3) Getting a very practical experience in developing your own business and your own
        communication campaign.
    4) Developing a practical sense about your own business inclinations, entrepreneurship and
        desires.
    5) Learn to ask Why!
Teaching Methods and structure
The course will combine lecture, discussion, group work, reflection, mentorship, creative work
and presentation.
The course begins with a short overview of the necessary tools in the field of brand promotion
and management (mostly a summary of your teachings in the program throughout the years).
Throughout the semester, Harvard Business Cases will be discussed in class by the instructor and
students. In parallel, students will be working on their own business project, while focusing on
                                                                                                    1


business development as well as brand promotion. Overall, the course is structured in a way that
enables students the exciting opportunity to work on their own business entrepreneurship.
In general, my philosophy emanates from a deep/ reflective/spiritual outlook of business,
marketing and communication and thus the entire class will be guided based on that particular
outlook, with a strong sense of creativity in the style of teaching.
Course Materials
Reading: “StoryScaping: Stop Creating Ads, Start Creating Worlds” by Gaston Legorburu
and Darren McColl (2014). This book could be easily purchased online in a very affordable
price.
Additional readings and course material will be available online and/or will be distributed in
class. Due to the dynamic nature of the class, readings and the actual course outline are
subject to change. Students will be held accountable for any changed reading material. In
the event changes do occur, reading assignments and scheduling will be posted on Canvas prior
to each class. It is the students’ responsibility to check Canvas regularly and before each class.
Writing:
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flags courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In our discipline writing precisely, creatively
and effectively is a major goal. Students should expect writing in podcast script, websites, cases’
information, presentations and reflection notes. Feedback will be provided via mentorship and
peer evaluation.
Assignments
The following section provides a brief summary of the course assignments; further explanations
will be provided by the instructor during the course of the semester.
    1) Business “from the soul” (Team): Over the course of the semester, teams will be
        working on promoting an original business idea, as well as its brand promotion plan.
        Deliverables:
            a. Phases’ presentations: three phases comprise the business from the soul project:
                understanding the business, figuring out the organizing idea of the communication
                plan and executing the actual brand promotion plan. Each phase is built upon its
                previous one.
            b. Final Presentation: as mentioned, students will be working on their business and
                brand proposal in phases throughout the course of the semester. This process will
                prepare them to present their final presentation at the very end of the session.
            c. Website: students will create an actual website for their company. You are
                welcome to use simple and free online programs to build your website such as
                wix.com.
    2) “Cases by the fire” (Team): 9 real business cases will be discussed with the instructor in
        class. Written cases deal with a situation that has already happened in the past.
        Accordingly, each team will need to prepare a short-written update about the company
        we are about to discuss and upload it onto Canvas.
                                                                                                   2


    3) StoryScaping Presentation (Team): each team is responsible to present one chapter
        from the StoryScaping book.
    4) Course Attendance: Students are expected to continuously attend, participate and
        contribute to class discussion. Attendance will be maintained by the TA.
    5) Peer Evaluations: I take peer evaluations very seriously. Every student is expected to
        significantly contribute to the team…. If I learn that this isn’t the case, the overall student
        grade will be affected.
Evaluation
The following percentage breakdown will constitute your final grade. Final grades will be made
using plus/minus grades. Specific evaluation instructions will be given to students prior to the
assignment’ due date. Please note that most of the assignments are done in groups.

Title IX Reporting:
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at
federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and
working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in
our community, the university can:1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or
escalating.2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced
harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation. 3. Investigate and discipline violations

Religious Holy Days Observance Policy
The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student
from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of
a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused
under this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an
examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable
time after the absence. A student who misses classes or other required activities, including
examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in
advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an
assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a
student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University
and uphold academic integrity. “Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use
words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite
your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary
action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic
Honesty and the University Honor Code.
Personal Pronouns
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and
topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender,
gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s
legal name, unless they have added a “preferred name” with the Gender and Sexuality Center
(http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-resources/ ). I will gladly honor
your request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster,
and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early
in the semester so that I may make appropriate updates to my records.
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all
learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude
you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your
needs and the requirements of the course. There are also a range of resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there
are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have
medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case
the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an
effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs
with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. Any
                                                                                                  8


student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact
Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 512-410-6644 (Video Phone) as
soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations. For more
information, visit http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/.
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle.
You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part
of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than
later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life
events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Food Pantry & Career Clothes Closet
Student Emergency Services in the Office of the Dean of Students has launched UT Outpost
(UA9 Building, 2609 University Ave; ring bell for service) to support students on our campus
that is equipped with a food pantry, and a career clothes closet to ensure every Longhorn has
access to professional clothes for job and internship interviews. Emergencies and financial
hardships can interfere with student success beyond the classroom, and this program will serve
as an additional resource for students.
