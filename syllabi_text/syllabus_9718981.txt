• Determine eligibility for listing in the National Register by applying criteria for significance and
    assessing integrity
• Develop analytical skills to interpret the meaning of built environments to a larger audience

    architectural style, configuration, and design
• Complete National Register of Historic Places documentation

APPROACH
This class covers historic property documentation using designation standards of the National Register
of Historic Places. Architectural and archeological surveys identify significant properties in a given area,
and inventories of such properties help raise awareness of cultural heritage, aid planning efforts, set
preservation priorities, and create a record of the present state of significant places. The National
Register is the nation's official list of cultural resources worthy of preservation and serves as the national
standard for the evaluation and written documentation of historic properties in the United States. This
course covers the steps to producing a National Register nomination, focusing on the ability to identity,
evaluate, and document historic properties. An overview of Texas properties listed in the National
Register will provide the context for evaluating historic properties throughout the course.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
• “The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
    individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold
    these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.”
    http://www.utexas.edu/about-ut/mission-core-purpose-honor-code
• Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
    including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
    dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on
    scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
• Plagiarism is a serious violation of academic integrity. In simplest terms, this occurs if you represent
    as your own work any material that was obtained from another source, regardless how or where
    you acquired it. Additional information about plagiarism is available at
