Exams:             All exams are closed book, closed notes. Exams will include material covered in reading
                   assignments and class discussions. Exam make-ups will be given only in the event of a
                   verified emergency or doctor-verified sickness.
                   The final exam for this class will be optional for those students who achieve a C grade or
                   better (≥74/100) on both of the first two exams. The default exam time provided by the
                   University is t.b.d.. Any student who meets the above criterion and chooses not to take the
                   final exam will have their midterm exam grade represent 50% of their course grade.
Homework:          You may discuss homework problems with other members of the class, but your
                   write-up must be done individually. Copying of homework solutions from others is
                   not allowed. You may turn in up to two homework assignments late (no more than one
                   week after the actual deadline). Other than that, no late homework will be accepted. The
                   late exception does not apply to the project reports.
Term Project:      There will be one term project on analyzing the impact of solar radiation on buildings. The
                   project will be done in groups of two over the course of the semester by performing a set of
                   experiment with a provided solar house experimental setup, registering the results and
                   commenting on the findings. Details will be provided in class.
Behavior:          Please do not talk to your classmates during the lecture as this disrupts the learning
                   environment. (Class activities organized by instructor are excluded). Please always bring
                   your Calculator, and keep your cell phone silent.
Attendance:        It is in your own best interest to attend class, I do not intend to check attendance. If for
                   some reason you do not come to class, it is your responsibility to make sure that you are
                   aware of any announcements that have been made and that you are familiar with the
                   material covered in class.
Office Hours:      I encourage all students to come and see me outside of class. This gives me an
                   opportunity to explain concepts that may be unclear, to get feedback on how the class is
                   going, and to get to know you. As far as possible, however, I ask that you restrict this
                   activity to the scheduled office hours.
Problems:          If you experience difficulty with the course material or encounter unexpected academic or
                   personal problems during the semester that might impact upon your performance in the
                   class, please let me know as soon as possible. I am always willing to help those who are
                   honest and who accept responsibility for their own actions.

Academic honesty: Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to
                   disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal
                   from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the
                   integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For
                   further information, please visit the Student Judicial Services web site
                   http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/
Dropping the Class: From the 1st through the 12th class day, an undergraduate student can drop a course
                   via the web and receive a refund, if eligible. From the 13th through the university’s academic
                   drop deadline, a student may drop a course with approval from the Dean, and departmental
                   advisor.
Course Instructor Evaluation: An evaluation of the course and instructor will be conducted at the end of
                   the semester using the approved UT Course/Instructor evaluation forms.
