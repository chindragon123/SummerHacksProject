Course Description:
This course is an introduction to Cultural Anthropology in the Global Age. It is designed
to introduce students to the central concepts, theories, and techniques employed by
cultural anthropologists to explore the social and cultural dimensions of human
experience in the 21st century. The course is organized around central questions in the
study of human societies, including what it means to study culture, language, and belief
systems in an interconnected global age; how systems of power affect our understandings

of race, ethnicity, nationalism, gender, sexuality, age, and class; and how changes in the
modern world influence our cultural understanding and practice of such fundamental
issues as politics, economics, health, religion migration, and art.
Global Cultures Flag
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Course Objectives
1. To familiarize students with the founding concepts, methods and debates in the
discipline of cultural anthropology.
2. To develop a critical analysis of how culture, as system(s) of meaning, constructs our
everyday life.
3. To generate an appreciation for cultural diversity.
4. To highlight the connections between the students’ lives to other places, peoples, and
processes in the world.
5. To understand the role of power in creating systems of hierarchy and oppression
both locally and globally.

university-prescribed plus/minus rubric. Please note: to ensure fairness, all grades are
absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. The University does not

Instructor: Dr. Suzanne Seriff
recognize the grade of A+.
A = 94-100; A- = 90-93; B+ = 87-89; B = 84-86; B- = 80-83; C+ = 77-79; C = 74-76;
C- = 70-73; D+ = 67-69; D = 64-66; D- = 60-63;               F= 0-60
ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION: (30%): Every student will be assigned a
section with obligatory meetings each week. Attendance will be taken both in lecture and
in your section and students are responsible for information covered in both lectures and
sections. Attendance and participation—through in class discussion, on line discussion
blogs, lectures, lecture quizzes, and class presentations-- will constitute 30% of your
semester grade. Each week there will be required readings, and a discussion blog.
    •   The discussion blog is our CANVAS site for summarizing and analyzing the
        weekly article from the Reader—or the ethnography-- based on concepts
        introduced in the Toolkit. There will be 11 blogs total, from which you will select
        the top 10 for your blog grade. You will get no points for turning the blog in late
        or missing a blog, and there will be no make ups. All blog entries are due by 9pm
        the day before your section. The blog entries should be about a page in length
        (double spaced) and fully address each of the elements in the prompt. Discussion
        blog entries are worth 10% of your final grade.
    •   Class Lectures: Students are expected to attend lectures regularly. Lecture
        outlines will be posted as ppt documents the week before the midterm and the end
        of term exam. Students are urged to follow the lectures carefully, take selective
        notes and participate in class discussions rather than trying to write everything
        down. All films listed under the Assignment column will be shown during lecture.
        They are listed here only in case you need to see them outside of class. In order to
        insure your attendance at lecture, there will be 5 pop quizzes during the semester.
        The entry code for the pop quiz, which you will complete on Canvas, will be
        announced ONLY during lecture and must be completed during that same day.
        There will be NO Makeup quizzes, even if you have an excused absence. We will
        give 6 quizzes throughout the semester and you will take the top five as credits for
        your lecture grade. Lecture quizzes are worth 5% of your final grade
    •   Section attendance is worth 10% of your grade. Attendance will be taken each
        day of section by the TA. You are allowed one unexcused section absence without
        penalty. After that, each unexcused absence in your section class will count for 2
        points off of your final grade, up to 5 absences. If you miss more than 5 sections,
        you will be docked your full participation grade as well.
    •   Fieldwork Journal Assignments: The occasional Fieldwork Journal
        assignments (listed under Assignments below) are designed to give you a chance
        to explore some of the theoretical concepts of the week through an experiential
        practice of fieldwork: conducting your own ethnographic mini-study in your own
        communities. These exercises should be completed BEFORE your section each
        week they are assigned, and will be discussed/analyzed in section. Although the

Instructor: Dr. Suzanne Seriff
        fieldwork exercises will not be specifically “graded,” they will inform your
        discussion in section, which will become part of your participation grade, below.
    •   Participation is worth 5% of your grade. TAs will keep track of your
        participation including both the number of times you contribute to discussion and
        the quality of your contributions. Your reflections on doing the fieldwork journal
        exercises, and what conclusions you drew from them, are a good way to
        contribute to the discussion of the week. If your contributions are particularly
        insightful and/or reflect a good grasp of the readings and materials, you will get
        the full 5 points. The section you are assigned is listed on your registration
        materials by unique number, and is also available through the Canvas. You must
        attend the section for which you are officially enrolled.
MIDTERM and END OF TERM EXAM (40%): This portion of your grade consists of
your midterm and end of term exam. The midterm exam will be given on a regular class
day the week before spring break, and the final exam will be given on the final day of
classes, May 6th. Each test (the midterm and second exam) will include multiple choice
questions, fill in the blank questions, and short essay questions. Questions will include
material covered in the assigned readings, lectures, discussions, and films. The second
exam will only cover material from the second half of the course (after spring break)
Make-up exams will only be given in the event of a serious illness or emergency, for
which official documentation is required. The midterm will be worth 20% of your final
grade and the second exam will be worth 20% of your final grade.
TAKE HOME ESSAY (10%): Students will complete one 2-3 page, double spaced take
home essay over the ethnography, “Aint No Makin It” by Jay MacLeod. The essay
question will be posted on Canvas at 9am on Wednesday, May 6th, and the take home
essay will be turned in online on Canvas by 11:59 on May 8th. This essay will be worth
10% of your final grade. Please note that the submission will be evaluated for plagiarism
by Turnitin.com.
WRITING ASSIGNMENT (20%): You will also be assigned one paper topic during the
second half of the semester. The paper should be between 5-6 pages in length. It will
have several cumulative components, each of which will be graded separately, including
a fieldwork component, a data gathering/research component, and an analysis
component.

Students are required to do their own research and work. All students are responsible for
knowing the standards of academic honesty:

Title IX:
Senate Bill 212 and Title IX Reporting Requirements. Under Senate Bill 212 (SB
212), the professor and TAs for this course are required to report for further investigation
any information concerning incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating
violence, and stalking committed by or against a UT student or employee. Federal law
and university policy also requires reporting incidents of sex- and gender-based
discrimination and sexual misconduct (collectively known as Title IX incidents). This
means we cannot keep confidential information about any such incidents that you share
with us. If you need to talk with someone who can maintain confidentiality, please
contact University Health Services (512-471-4955 or 512-475-6877) or the UT
Counseling and Mental Health Center (512-471-3515 or 512-471-2255). We strongly
urge you make use of these services for any needed support and that you report any Title
IX incidents to the Title IX Office.

Students will find the CANVAS site under the unique number for which they are
enrolled. All correspondence between you, your TA, and your fellow students in your
section and your instructor will be conducted within this site. Please regularly check the
announcements on the site, which is where your instructor will convey any changes to the
schedule, due dates, or general announcements. The CANVAS site will be demonstrated
during the first week of the class in your section.
    •   The CANVAS site will include the syllabus, any instructions or announcements to
        students, power points of the week’s lectures (uploaded before each exam), exam
        reviews, prompts for your discussion blogs, assignment instructions and access to
        any additional readings or URLs (in addition to your textbooks) These will be
        found under FILES on your CANVAS page. All emails to the professor should be
        to sseriff@austin.utexas.edu
