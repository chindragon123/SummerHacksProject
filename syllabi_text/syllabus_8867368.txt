This course fulfills a Writing Flag and the Cultural Diversity in the United States Flag.
Scope of the course: In 1682, the first American bestseller was published. Audiences in the American
colonies and in England devoured Mary Rowlandson’s breathless account of her harrowing experiences as
a captive of the Narragansett and Nipmunk Indians during King Philip’s War in The Narrative of the
Captivity and the Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson. Taking a long, historical view, this course
explores the evolution of American popular culture and its relationship to national consolidation (and at
times, disunion) over the last 336 years. Starting with oral, religious, print, and live performance traditions
during the colonial, early national, and antebellum periods, this course will consider the cultural impact of
new technologies such as steam power, the railroad, photography, recorded sound, celluloid, the electronic
transmission of moving images, and the internet. Throughout the semester, we will stress the centrality of
race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class in shaping the production and content of popular culture, modes
of popular representation, the composition of popular audiences, types of reception, and the ways in which
people have used pop cultural forms as a claim to citizenship.
Class Format: This is a discussion seminar, but occasionally, I will lecture in order to provide broader
historical overviews of specific forms of popular culture, such as film and television; additionally, I will
also discuss pop cultural theorists, such as bell hooks, Antonio Gramsci, Raymond Williams, Chandra
Talpade Mohanty, Michel Foucault, and Lawrence Levine. These brief introductions to key theorists will
help you understand the conceptual and the methodological tools people use to study popular cultural
history.
Requirements: Mandatory attendance, active participation in the discussion—including responding to
select discussion questions from your peers, completion of all reading and writing assignments; in-class
presentation; and a take-home final essay examination.
Attendance Policy: If you are absent, you must tell me IN ADVANCE—either in person, by telephone, or
via email. If you have THREE UNEXCUSED ABSENCES, your grade will be lowered by a half of a letter
grade for each subsequent absence.
Religious Holy Days: You will be automatically excused for missing class on religious holy days.
However, you must let me know about your absence in advance so that we can make alternate assignment
arrangements, if necessary. With prior notice, I will mark all religious holy days absences as “Excused.”

Discussion Format: Be prepared to discuss and analyze the historical significance of the reading
assignment for each class. Occasionally, we will break into smaller groups to analyze specific cultural
objects in relation to the reading assignments, lectures, and larger course themes. For example, we will
study actual copies of Ms. Magazine when we discuss specific chapters of Susan Douglas, Where the Girls
Are. You will also engage in periodic free-write sessions in small groups that you will share with your
classmates as part of the discussion. In all discussions, please be prepared to make historical connections
across assignments and across historical periods.
Study Questions Format: 3-5 questions per set, based on a reading assignment of your choice, due at the
beginning of the class date on which the reading is assigned. Please note that you may write only twice on
the same author during the semester. You are responsible for a TOTAL of five sets of questions. Here are
some suggested guidelines to help you frame your questions analytically, rather than descriptively. Please
note that you do NOT need to incorporate all of these guidelines into each question. Some will be more
pertinent than others, depending on your approach to your questions:
1) What sources does the author use to make her/his analysis? 2) How is the work organized—
chronologically and/or thematically? What historical themes does s/he explore? 3) Does the author appear
to have any political bias or specific political agenda in writing this work? 4) What is the author’s
argument? 5) What types of historical and/or thematic connections can you make between this work and
other reading assignments? In all cases, if you quote from an assignment, please provide a page number
after your quoted material in parenthesis. The final day to submit your last set of study questions is in class
on December 6.
Class Presentation Format: During the semester, you will make a short (5-7 minute) presentation on a
topic of your choosing related to “Pop Culture in the News.” In your presentation, you should provide a
brief overview of your news item, and then you should offer some historical analysis tying your news item
to other events and/or themes in the history of American popular culture. If you prefer, you can focus your
discussion on the relationship of your news item to the week’s reading assignment. We will set up a
presentation schedule on the second day of class. Typically, one student will present in each class.
5-7-page Paper Structure and Format: You will write a 5-7-page analytic essay on a pop cultural object
of your choice. Please note that this page length refers to the text portion of your essay. Your chosen pop
cultural object might be a song, doll, sermon, poem, poster, album cover, Suffragette pin, painting, corset,
movie, cartoon, swimsuit, iconic and/or watershed episode of a TV show, piece of Astroturf, viral YouTube
video, fad, meme, etc. You must, however, receive my permission in advance for the object you choose.
Your pop cultural object can be from the present day; however, your paper MUST contain some historical
component. In other words, even if you choose a contemporary (or fairly recent) object, you must situate its
significance historically. For example, if you were to analyze the extraordinarily popular YouTube video,
“Gangnam Style” by Psy, (clocking in, as of this writing, with more than 3.2 billion unique views since it
debuted in July 2012) you should think historically about the video. Here are some historically-situated
threads of analysis for consideration: making connections between the video’s satirical treatment of Seoul’s
posh Gangnam District, known as the “Beverly Hills of South Korea” and the growth of South Korea’s
booming consumer culture in the decades following the Korean War; exploring the rise of K-Pop in the
USA and the proliferation of celebrity culture via reality TV and social media. Alternatively, you might
focus your analysis on Psy’s transnational fusion of musical and dance styles, all of which have long
historical roots.
Overall, your essay must be logically organized and supported by at least five sources. Only one of your
sources can be a website, although scholarly articles downloaded from a research database, such as a
specific newspaper database on ProQuest, or an online academic journal are exempt from this rule. Please
do NOT use Wikipedia as a sole source. It’s fine to start exploring aspects of your topic with Wikipedia,
but please use this site only as a way to find other sources, including primary material and secondary
sources of record. Your paper must contain endnote citations following pages five to seven. Your endnotes
must conform to standard citation format in Humanities disciplines. Please see the Chicago Manual of Style
in order to format your endnote citations: http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html
Additionally, you can download electronic database sources from the UT Libraries site already formatted in
Chicago Style. Thereafter, simply cut and paste downloaded citations into each respective endnote.


                                                                                                              3
Your essay must be typed, double-spaced, with one-inch margins, twelve-point font, and numbered pages.
You should organize the essay in the following manner: 1) An INTRODUCTION, or an overview of your
topic, including a thesis statement, which tells your reader how you will interpret the significance of the
subject matter of your essay 3) A BODY, comprised of concrete evidence to support your interpretive
thesis statement 4) A CONCLUSION, which summarizes the body of the paper, reiterating (with different
wording) and substantiating the thesis statement. 5) A BIBLIOGRAPHY of your sources that follows pages
five to seven. In crafting your thesis statement, as well as the body of your analysis, please consider the
following questions: 1) What is the historical significance of this object? 2) Why is this object important to
the study of popular culture in terms of producers and/or popular audiences? 3) Does this object appeal to a
specific market segment? If so, to whom does it appeal? Why?
Your first draft of the 5-7-page paper will be due in class on October 23. Your revised paper will be due in
class on November 20.
Final Take-Home Essay Exam Structure and Format:
You must answer 1 question (choice of 2) using relevant material from the reading assignments, lectures,
discussion, and presentations to support your essay. This is an open-book test. This essay should be at least
seven pages and must not exceed ten pages. It must be typed, double-spaced, with one-inch margins and
twelve-point font. Your essay must include an INTRODUCTION, including an interpretive THESIS
STATEMENT; a BODY; and a CONCLUSION. The materials you discuss in your essay should support
your interpretive thesis statement. You may use parenthetical citations when quoting verbatim material for
this take-home essay. Here are some examples: (Cook, p. 58); (Davis Lecture, “The Birth of the Movies
and the Dawning of Celebrity Culture,” 10/11/18).
