   This course focuses on essential developments in Greek history (social, cultural, and political) during the
   Archaic and Classical Periods (ca. 750-338 BCE): from the rise of the Greek city-states in the eighth
   century BCE to the subordination of Greece by Philip II of Macedonia in 338 BCE. We will devote roughly
   equal time to covering major events and personalities, exploring key developments in culture and society,
   and examining the various types of evidence available for the era (both written and archeological). We
   will begin (Weeks 1-3) with a brief look at the geography and climate of Greece and its prehistory,
   including the Bronze and Early Iron Ages (ca. 1600-800 BCE). Then (Weeks 3-5) we will consider the
   major developments of the Early Archaic Period (ca. 800-600 BCE), including the rise of the city-state (or
   polis) and the first forms of (small “d”) democracy, the invention of the Greek alphabet, the introduction of
   massed infantry (or hoplite) warfare, and the diaspora of Greeks across the Mediterranean. Thereafter
   (Weeks 6-15), we will focus on the two most famous city-states of Greece, Athens and Sparta, and
   follow their trajectories from their foundation in the Bronze Age, through the Persian War period (490-478
   BCE), the Peloponnesian War (430-404 BCE), and the complex period of unstable hegemonies in the
   first half of the fourth century BCE, culminating in 338 BCE when Philip II of Macedonia established his
   control over Greece.

   Additional required materials will also be posted on Canvas.
   II. Canvas
   We will make extensive use of Canvas. In addition to the Syllabus, you will find the following course
   materials there:
        “Assignment and Study Guide” for each lecture
        “Assignment and Study Guide” for the each week’s discussion section
        weekly quizzes
        study guides for the three examinations
        supplementary readings
        powerpoints
   III. Lectures
   There will be two weekly lectures (MW 1:00-2:00 in Waggener Hall 201). These will combine historical
   outline with exploration of historical themes and problems in the interpretation of historical evidence. In
   order to get the most out of the lectures you will need to have completed the reading assignment in
   advance of the lecture.
   The Syllabus provides a road map for the course. You will find the assignments on Canvas in Modules.
   The Assignments will list the readings for the day, study questions to help guide you through the
   readings, and sometimes links to websites, images, etc. You are not required to write out answers to the
   questions asked on the Assignment and Study Guide for each lecture unless you are specifically asked
   to do so. We will not take up all of the questions together in lecture, but you should be able to answer
   them.
   IV. Discussion Sections
   The weekly sections are required; informed participation in them will constitute a major part of your final
   grade (see below). The main purpose of the discussion sections is to learn how to analyze ancient
   sources and discuss interpretations of them both orally and in writing. You will find the assignments for
   the discussion sections, study questions, and sometimes links to websites, images, etc.. You should
   come prepared to discuss the questions in the discussion sections. You will need to bring the relevant
   materials (readings and images etc.) with you to section.

   Discussion Section Participation. Informed participation in discussion is required, meaning that you must
   contribute regularly to the in-class conversation and demonstrate your familiarity with the primary
   sources (both textual and archaeological) assigned for each section.
   Weekly Quizzes. Every week on Tuesday afternoon (starting from Week 3) a quiz concerning the primary
   source readings assigned for the Thursday-Friday sections will be set on Canvas. You are required to
   complete it online in advance of your section. The quiz will be available up to 10 minutes before the start
   of the section. Remember that weekly quizzes must be completed even in case of absence at lectures or
   sections or if.
   In-Class Presentation. Beginning Week 4, each student will choose one item among the underlined
   ancient sources assigned for each weekly section and present it in class. In Week 3 we will discuss how
   to organize the presentation and will set up a calendar for the rest of the semester. Presentations will be
   scheduled from Week 4 to Week 13, one or two per section.
   V. Calendar and Grading
   20%        Exam I (Monday, 10/1)
   20%        Exam II (Monday, 11/5)
   25%        Exam III (Monday, 12/10)
   35%        Discussion Section*
   *Your grade in the Discussion Section will be based on the following components:
        attendance and informed participation in discussion (10%)
        quizzes (10%)
        in-class presentations (15%)
   A 93-100; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76; C- 70-72; D+ 67-69; D 63-66; D-
   60-62; F 59 and below.
   There will be no curve. If 50% of you score over 93, 50% of you will get an A. If nobody does, nobody
   will. Consistent improvement during the semester will improve your final course grade.

   will. Consistent improvement during the semester will improve your final course grade.
   When merely quantitative methods cannot be applied, I will assign grades according to the following
   qualitative standards: an A-range grade (A+, A, A-) indicates complete mastery of the material and skills
   involved in the assignment; a B-range grade (B+, B, B-) indicates advanced competency; a C-range
   grade (C+, C, C-) indicates basic competency; a D-range grade (D+, D, D-) indicates effort but
   insufficient competency; an F means that either you put no effort in the assignment or something went
   dramatically wrong.
   If you have a question about a grade you receive on an exam you must wait at least one day before
   seeing your instructor or TA and you must read through any comments on the exam. Please be aware
   that it you do object to the grading of some portion of your exam, we will read through the entire exam.
   This could result in your score going up or down.
   Make-up exams will be arranged only in the event of documented illness or other emergency; you must
   let me know as far in advance of the exam as possible. Additionally, students may make up work missed
   for a religious holiday if they bring documentation of the holiday fourteen days in advance.
   VI. Attendance
   Attendance is mandatory for discussion sections and (of course) strongly encouraged for lectures. Each
   student is allowed 1 unexcused absences from discussion section without
   penalty. Any other absence must be appropriately documented (e.g., with a doctor’s note or a note from
   Student Emergency Services – Office of the Dean of Students). Notify me of your situation as soon as
   possible and document it immediately upon your return.
   Failure to comply with these rules will result in the loss of 1% of your final grade for each unexcused
   absence.
    VII. Class Etiquette
   Cell phones should be turned off or set to silent ring during class time. The use of laptops and tablets is
   allowed only for taking notes and checking assigned readings.
   Phones, laptops, and tablets must be put away and turn off during exams. Failure to do so will result in
   the immediate invalidation of the exam.
   Scholastic dishonesty on any graded assignment or quiz/exam will result in zero credit on the
   assignment or quiz/exam. A second infraction will result in an F for the course. Allcases of scholastic
   dishonesty will be reported to the student’s college adviser.
   Scholastic dishonesty includes any kind of cheating or collaboration on tests, or submitting work that is
   not either your own or accurately attributed to its source. For more information, contact Student Judicial
   Services at 471-2841, or go to http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
