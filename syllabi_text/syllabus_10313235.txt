Course Overview:
        Often viewed as a medium of “pure entertainment,” film has also had an essential relationship
to evolving social conditions in the United States and the struggle for change. This course will focus
those moments where cinema has commented upon, documented, and even arguably had a hand in
producing social change. The course aims to acquaint students with the film movements, film
authors, production conditions, and audience reception practices that have linked film to broader
social movements. It will also teach students basic and essential terminology and style for writing
about film, which is increasingly vital for competent citizenship in our media-driven public sphere. In
addition, it will introduce students to basic theoretical concepts fundamental to understanding social
conditions and social change including, power, ideology, hegemony, institutions, etc. Given the time
constraints, the course focuses on American cinema with occasional references to influential cinema
movements across the globe to place this American discourse in global perspective.
Required Readings:

paragraph in response to one or more of the week’s readings. Reading responses are due on the class
canvas page every Thursday 11:59 PM (must do AT LEAST 10 throughout the semester).
Film Pitch
During Week 4, we will pick groups in order to create a pitch for a social change film. The groups
will present their pitches during Week 6.
Paper Presentation
In Weeks 15 and 16 each student will conduct a power point presentation to the class on the subjects
that their final papers intend to cover. These presentations will aid in strengthening presentation skills
as well as mining through any questions or concerns that one may still have while completing their
final papers. Great work requires constructive peer feedback.


Final Paper
The seminar final paper is due via hard copy during Week 16. The final paper is to be 8-10 pages,
double-spaced, Times New Roman 12-point font, and 1-inch margins.

NOTE: All screenings and assigned readings are subject to change as the semester progresses.
ATTENDANCE: Attendance in screenings and lectures is mandatory.
Two latenesses and/or early departures count as an absence. Each absence will hurt your final
participation grade for attendance.
LAPTOP and CELL PHONE USEAGE: Cell Phones should be silenced during class. Laptops
may be used for note-taking only. Use of laptops for other purposes, most especially social
media, will counts against your course grade. If you receive multiple warnings about this, it will
count as an absence.
ACADEMIC HONESTY and PLAGIARISM: Plagiarism is a serious offense.
Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, multiple
submissions, facilitating academic dishonesty, coercion regarding grades, unauthorized collaboration,
forgery, and theft. Also, should a student purchase or otherwise acquire a document from a third party
and submit such a document as original work for the class assignment, such action is plagiarism and a
violation of the code.
OFFICE HOURS: I am happy to meet with you during office hours to discuss your work, as
well as any other questions or concerns you might have regarding the class. If you would like to
meet with me during office hours, please email me to schedule a time. If you cannot make my
office hours let me know, and we can try to schedule an appointment for a different time.
LATE WORK: Assignments are due by the date and time indicated on the syllabus and
assignments. For each day (notice this is not each class but each day) that an assignment is late it
will receive a 1 letter grade penalty (ex. an A becomes a B).
  Writing assistance: Carefully read through guidelines for the research and writing assignments,
  passed out well before each due date, as these guidelines will influence the grading of the
  assignments you turn in. It is recommended that you consult with your TA or me prior to the due
  dates in order to obtain further clarification regarding the assignments and to discuss possible
  topics, reference materials, and/or writing difficulties.

   with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics,
   sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the
   instructor with the student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an
   alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so
   that I may make appropriate changes to my records.
   Services for Students with Disabilities: Upon request, The University of Texas at Austin
   provides appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. Students
   with physical or learning disabilities should provide the professor with a letter requesting
   reasonable academic accommodation, and work directly with the professor to determine what
   accommodations are needed. This letter can be obtained from Services for Students with
   Disabilities, located in the Student Services Building. For more information, contact the Office
   of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY, or visit their website.

   or psychological disability and need accommodation to take part in or to complete the required
   work for this course.

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally
funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working
environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our
community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
become involved in a Title IX investigation.


3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies. Faculty members and
certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters,”
which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a
Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing,
discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title
IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak
with someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options
and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
