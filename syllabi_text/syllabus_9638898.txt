Text            Stewart, Calculus, Early Transcendentals, Eighth Edition, used
                only for extra homework. You can buy an online book. See the
                links on my site and in Canvas.
Topics          Chapters 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, Detailed syllabus : p5-5
PreReqs         Appropriate score on placement exams.
Goals           Goals: This isn't a theorem/proof class. The goal is for you to learn
                new techniques, to write answers in a clear coherent form, to see
                applications and to get some understanding of why calculus works.
                The University of Texas provides appropriate academic accommodations
SSD
                for qualified students with disabilities. For more information,contact the
                Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY. If you plan on
                using accomodations, YOU NEED TO SEE ME EARLY in the semester,
                and RESERVE A ROOM EARLY, or you'll lose your chance.

TA Info
All your exam and quizzes are in your TA session. If you switch times, I won't grade your exams.
Talk to us if you must switch, even for just one day.

TA Office Hours:
Getting A Regrade
You can ask for a regrade to correct things that you feel we missed, or graded unfairly.
We will never lower your grade.
The Rules: Ignore the rules, I won't regrade your stuff
0) To get a regrade, you must take the exam/quiz in ink.
1) You can't get a regrade if you don't pick up your stuff
2) Compare your work with the online solutions.
3) Mark what you want me to look at, and give the exam/quiz to me in class. NOT MY OFFICE
4) Ask for the regrade within three MWF days after we give it back in TA session.
5) I'll bring the regraded paper to class with me, usually the next class day.
Ichiban Very Important Rule: Don't throw stuff away. I give second regrades before the final.


Computing your grade
AV = 25*(Quiz Average) + .5*(Exam Average) .25*Final
Your average determines your grade: no special deals, no retakes, no curves. The rules on this
syllabus are legally binding.
Study Advice
a) You will need to be in class, taking notes.
b) Watch out for your algebra; it's easy to lose points.
c) You need to show work. Anyone can get answers from Google; I want to see what you learned.
Here's a general plan for studying:
a) Start with working problems. If you get stuck, check your notes to see whether I did a
similar problem. If not, discuss it with your study pals. You can also take a picture of your
work and email me.
b) If something seems wrong on the 14U problems, email me. Don't waste hours of your
own time.
c) Go to TA session to work practice quiz/exam problems.
Where to find study material:
a) The problems in Stewart are too simple, so we have extra practice. For studying, you can start
with Stewart but that isn't enough and your exam problems will be harder.
b) Every week I post 14U problems with solutions. Because the course moves so quickly, you need
to do these problems every night, after the lecture, or at the very least, every weekend. Solutions are
posted, too!
c) The homework has problems to practice you for the quizzes and exams. They don't have solutions;
these are meant to be done in your TA session.
 d) Finally, GO THROUGH YOUR NOTES to see if there's anything you've missed.
This is not a course in which you drill dozens of problems and then get you problems just like
the drill. You need to do more than problems: you need to think about the kinds of problems you've
seen and you need to organize that in your mind. The YAPS are designed to help.
