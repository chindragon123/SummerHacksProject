Overview
Welcome to this​ communication course for engineering students! We are so glad you’re here, whether you are from ME
or another engineering department.
The chief aim of the course is to learn about and practice communicating in a variety of professional and academic
situations. The main areas covered are technical writing, presentations, graphical display, and face-to-face communication,
all oriented toward professional engineering settings. Our theme this summer is design.
This course also deals with engineering ethics--questions about right and wrong for engineering professionals, some of
which you are probably already thinking about. For example, if you want to work in clean energy to lessen harm to the
environment, that’s a desire based in ethics.
I am determined to convince you that communication is not just the icing on the engineering cake--it’s a key ingredient in
the cake. There can be no engineering without effective communication. But if I am not successful in persuading you of
this profound truth, it’s okay, because then communication still the icing, and who wants cake without icing?
Note:​ Credit for rhetoric 306 is a prerequisite for this course, whereas ME 333T is a prerequisite for ME 366J.
Flags
This course carries an Ethics and Leadership Flag, as well as a Writing Flag. Courses with the
ethics flag are designed to inspire critical thinking on issues related to making ethical decisions in
your adult and professional life.

Attending vs. actually being ​present
They are not the same and both matter! Much of the learning in both Lecture and Workshops happens through
structured activities and discussions. You need to be present mentally as well as physically. All of what you learn in class
won’t be posted on Canvas but may still show up on quizzes. Attitudes can make or break a class: willing participation
will lift it up. Please help make this class wonderful!
And (obviously) try not to be absent; we, in turn, will try to make the course worth your while, as we have in designing
the course.​ If you do exceed two absences​ (in lecture and workshop combined), we will begin to deduct a percentage
point per absence from your course grade. Why? Because some people might need to be protected from their own
distractibility. Please don’t arrive late or leave early. Both are disruptive and send a message of disrespect, however
unintended. But if you have a distant course just before or after this class, do let us know. We certainly understand that
situation (and have experienced it ourselves on this campus).
Please note: If you miss a class, do get notes from a classmate. We do not re-teach a class for those who have missed. If
anyone asks me, “What did we do in the class I missed?” I will simply refer him or her to this paragraph. With a
heavy sigh.
You do not have to be an outgoing person to get full credit for participation and engagement, but I expect everyone to
be able to contribute to small-group discussions, to be attentive, and to read the assigned materials.
On the other hand, it is possible to talk ​too much​ in class. But how much is too much? ​If you notice you are making
more than three comments in class, it is probably time to sit back and give others a chance--even if they seem
reluctant.
Electronics and the Classroom Environment


                                                                                 Voss ME 333T Syllabus, Summer 2019, UT-Austin, p. 5
In the interest of creating the best course experience that we can, I also require that you not engage in ​distracting or
unmindful behaviors​ in class. ​Electronic devices need to be put away ​except for your laptop, ​used for class
purposes only. If I see that someone is on Snapchat or doing homework for another class (etc.), I may count
you as absent. ​This is where there truly is a generation gap, and I choose to assert my authority accordingly. (I do not
believe that our phones are extensions of our bodies...yet.)
NO PHONES. EVER. I WILL COUNT YOU ABSENT. ​(OMG, she seemed so nice until now.)
In general, we ask that everyone behave respectfully to everyone else, which is probably what you do anyway.
Writing, Revision, and Late Policy
Full assignment descriptions will be listed under each assignment, within a Module. ​Always upload your work in PDF
form.​ Work is due at the time indicated in the assignment on Canvas.
A preliminary draft will usually be required so that you can get feedback from classmates. (If anyone doesn’t bring a
draft, they won’t receive credit for peer review but will get credit for coming to class.) You can also come to office hours
to have us look at particular sections. Revision is the truly the path to writing better. It pays off. My best advice is work
hard at it.
This course carries a ​Writing Flag​ since it gives you experience and instruction in writing in an academic discipline,
contains several substantial writing projects, and offers feedback from your peers and instructors to help with revision.
 If you must turn something in late, I will accept it up to three days after the due date, but I may deduct 5% for each day
                                                                                                                               late.

From these outcomes you can see that we are achieving four of the outcomes specified by ABET, the organization that
gives accreditation to American undergraduate engineering programs:

            UT Resources
     1.     The Cockrell School has a wonderful ​library, ​The Mckinney Engineering Library​ in EER, ​with very helpful
            librarians who are happy to aid you in finding appropriate sources. We even have a librarian dedicated to
            mechanical engineering, Larayne Dallas. Be sure to take your assignment with you (or pull it up electronically)
            so that the librarians can help you more effectively.


                                                                       Voss ME 333T Syllabus, Summer 2019, UT-Austin, p. 7
     2.   Likewise, the ​Undergraduate Writing Center​ (in the PCL) is a terrific resource, and you have already paid for it
          through your fees, so why not take advantage of it? (Professional writers never go it alone. They have multiple
          readers as well as a professional editor.)
     3.   If you have any kind of ​disability,​ or even think you might, be sure to take advantage of the support available to
          you! Based in the philosophy that all students should be assured equal access and opportunity, ​Services for
          Students with Disabilities​ works to eliminate physical, instructional and attitudinal barriers by providing
          reasonable accommodations and fostering awareness within the University community. (And we instructors
          fully support this mission.) SSD is housed in the ​Division of Diversity and Community Engagement,​ located
          on the fourth floor of the Student Services Building. ​Information on how to register,​ downloadable forms,
          including ​guidelines for documentation​ and ​accommodation request letters​ are available online. Please do not
          hesitate to contact us if you have any questions. We look forward to making your experience at the university
          more accessible!
 ​Grading scale:​ ​Here is how letter grades map to percentage grades (and thus to the four point system) in this
class:
  A = 94-100          B+ = 87-89           C+ = 77-79           D+ = 67-69          F= 0-60
  A- = 90-93          B = 84-86            C = 74-76            D = 64-66
                      B- = 80-83           C- = 70-73           D- = 60-63
Academic Honesty:​ ​All work submitted in this course must be your own and be written exclusively for this
course. The use of all sources (ideas, quotations, paraphrases) must be properly documented. ​The most common
reasons for plagiarism are 1) slipshod copying and pasting, 2) careless electronic note taking, 3) failing to cite
paraphrases.​ ​Plagiarism or any other form of academic dishonesty can result in ​a failing grade for the course and
notice to the dean.​ We will discuss plagiarism (especially unintentional plagiarism--which is still treated as plagiarism) in
more detail later in the semester. For more on UT’s policy on scholastic dishonesty, please ​see:

The Bedford Handbook​ also has an excellent section.
Please come see or email us if you have any questions about your use of sources, or ask a librarian or
Writing Center consultant.
                                  Let’s have a terrific semester!
