Introduction:​ PHY 303L is a calculus-based introductory course sequence for engineering
students. It carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. A background in physics at the high school
level is strongly recommended.
Corequisites​: Physics 303K and 103M with a grade of at least C- in each, credit with a grade of
at least C- or registration in Mathematics 408D or 408M, and Physics 103N.
QUEST System​: This course makes use of the web-based Quest content delivery and
homework server system maintained by the College of Natural Sciences. This homework
service will require a $30 charge per student per class for its use, with no student being charged
more than $60 a semester. This goes toward the maintenance and operation of the resource.
Please go to​ ​http://quest.cns.utexas.edu​ to log in to the Quest system for this class. After the
12th day of class, when you log into Quest you will be asked to pay via credit card on a secure
payment site. Quest provides mandatory instructional material for this course, just as is your
textbook, etc. For payment questions, email quest.billing@cns.utexas.edu.
Pre-Class Reading and In-Class Quizzes: ​Before coming to class you are expected to have
read the relevant materials from the textbook for that day. During the lectures, interactive quiz
questions will be given to highlight the course materials. In order to participate, sign up at
squarecap.com following the instructions here:
https://support.squarecap.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001358353-Student-handout-Canvas-Sign-I
n-schools-​. It charges $12 for five months, or $18 for a year. A smart phone, tablet, or laptop is
required. Questions can be answered via the Squarecap app or browsers (Chrome is
recommended). It is necessary to use the UT Wifi so that the attendance can be properly
recorded. If you submit a wrong answer, you still get 90% credit. We will start counting the quiz
scores on Thursday July 18. The lowest 4 in-class quiz grades will be dropped. The drops are
intended to compensate for non-participation due to legitimate excuses as well as problems
related to Squarecap.


Homework​: You will work on the homework online at​ ​https://quest.cns.utexas.edu​. The
homework assignments will be due at 11:00 p.m. on the dates listed on the last page. Solutions
will be available online the next morning at 9:00 a.m. There are 9 assignments and the lowest 2
grades will be dropped in the calculation of the semester grade. You may work together on the
homework. You must, however, submit your own for credit. Read the students’ instructions at
https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/questla/My+Assignments​. In particular, pay attention to the
QUEST convention for numerical answers. See the following page at
https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/questla/Numbers+and+Scientific+Notation
Midterm Exams and Final Exam​: There will be three midterm exams during class time on the
following Wednesdays: July 24, July 31, and August 7. The lowest midterm grade will be
dropped in the calculation of the course grade. No makeup exams will be given. If you miss a
midterm exam, it will be the one that will be dropped. The final exam is comprehensive and
mandatory and will be held on August 17, 7:00-10:00 p.m., as scheduled by the Registrar’s
Office. No early final exam will be given. The midterm and final exams will be closed book but
an equation sheet will be provided. You are also allowed to bring in one letter-sized (8.5” by 11”)
handwritten​ formula sheet (it is OK to write on both sides). Bring your own calculator for
numerical calculations only (no computer, iPhone etc.). Academic dishonesty will not be
tolerated.
TA Discussion Sessions: ​TA discussion sessions are an integral part of this course, and are
scheduled daily. TA takes attendance and offer a 0.5% bonus per TA session, up to 10 sessions
(5%). During each session, the TA will reiterate the course materials, work out examples similar
to homework problems, or provide hints to solving homework problems. The location and time
will be announced by the TA.
Grading: ​Course grades will be calculated based on the weighted sum of the following:
In-Class Quizzes (4 drops) 15%, Homeworks (2 drops) 25%, Midterm Exams (1 drop) 30%,
Final Exam 30%, and Discussion Session Participation (bonus): 5%. A historic cutoff scheme for
the semester grade is as follows. A: >=90, A-: >=85, B+: >=80, B: >=75, B-: >=70, C+: >=65, C:
>=60, C-: >=55, D+: >= 50, D: >= 45, and D-: >=40. Below 40 is failing. ​The instructor reserves
the right to readjust the thresholds according to the class performance.
Chapter Topics: ​22-Electric Force; 23-Electric Field; 24-Gauss’ Law; 25-Potential and Energy;
26-Capacitance; 27-Current and Resistance; 28-DC Circuits; 29-Magnetic Force, Field, and
Ampere’s Law; 30-Currents and Charges in a Magnetic Field; 31-Induction and Faraday’s Law;
32-AC Circuits; 33-Electromagnetic Waves; 34-Geometrical Optics; 35-Interference and
Diffraction.
Special Accommodations​:​ ​The University provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office
of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY.
