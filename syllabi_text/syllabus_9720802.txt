                    A plus or minus grading scale will be used to assign final grades, with an

                        1. The exams will be administered during the times outlined in this
                             syllabus calendar. Please reserve these times in advance so that you
                             do not have a conflict during a scheduled exam. You must sit for the
                             exams on the dates and times scheduled. If an extraordinary event
                             (death in immediate family, illness requiring hospitalization, etc.),

                             due to the integrated nature of tax law, there may be a
                             comprehensive element to each exam.
                        3. During each exam you may use a calculator, your text, notes, and
                             any printed material you wish to bring. You may not use your laptop,
                             tablet, cell phone during exams.


                      There is assigned reading for each class meeting and you are expected
                      to come prepared to discuss the material.
Outside Reading       Problems are included in each chapter and the solutions to the problems
  and Problems        are posted on Canvas. Although these problems will not be collected or
                      graded, you are encouraged to work through these problems as they will
                      help you learn the material and prepare for the exams.

                 This project will incorporate tax research, comprehension and analysis,
  Group Project critical thinking, creative presentation, visual data illustration and
                 communication skills.
                 In calculating your final grade, 100 points will come from your display of
                 professionalism in my class. This discretionary evaluation will be based
                 upon the following:
                      • Class attendance
                      • Participating in class discussions
                      • Evidence of preparedness by responding to class questions

               responsibilities described there. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to
               observe all student responsibilities described there. If the application of the
               Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is
     Policy on unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
   Scholastic Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to
   Dishonesty disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or
               dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all
               students, the integrity of the University, and the value of our academic brand,
               policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to
