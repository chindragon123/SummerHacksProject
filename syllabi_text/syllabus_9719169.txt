Exams and Homework:
There will be two midterm exams (15% each) and one final exams (40%).
    •    The final exam covers every topic. Two midterm exams are not cumulative.
    •    Exams may include multiple-choice, short answer, and computational questions.
    •    Any request for a re-grade must be made in writing no more than seven days after the exam is returned.
         The request must state, in detail, the reason you believe the grade is in error. Requests that do not conform
         to this policy will not be honored.
    •    Any missed exam must be approved either in advance or through Student Emergency Services. Makeup
         exams will be given only in extraordinary circumstances (at my discretion). For ordinary absences, the
         weight will be assigned to the other exam. If you do not have a valid reason, you will receive a grade of
         zero. I reserve the right to adjust grades for extraordinary class contribution.
Homework assignments account for 30% of your total score. The highest 10 scores will be considered for your
total score. For each question,
    •    You will get full credit if your answer is correct.
    •    You will get partial credit (50%) if your approach to the question is reasonable.
    •    You will get zero credit otherwise.
    •    Working on the assignments with other students is encouraged, but you must write your own answer.


     •   Homework is collected at the beginning of the class on the due date. It must be stapled, with each
         question clearly presented. Office hours tend to be crowded right before exams and thus keeping up with
         homework is to your advantage.
Class Participation: Extra points will be awarded for students who actively participate in class discussion (up to
15%). I do not track attendance, but you need to notify me if your absence will be for an extended time.
Midterm 1: 15%           Midterm 2: 15%         Final: 40%             Homework: 30%           Participation
                                             100                                                         15
                                                Total score: 100 + 15
Curved Grades: Grades will be based on a curve. A curve means that you cannot assume anything about what a
score means as far as a grade. In other words, a score of 90 does not guarantee an “A,” nor does a score below 60
guarantee an “F.” The class average is generally expected to be approximately 3.3, although this may vary based
on my assessment of overall class performance. Plus/minus grading will be used.
Class Conduct: Professional behavior is required. In particular, please put away cell phones. If you have
unusual circumstances, speak with me about it before class. Please note that you may step out of the room at any
time, provided you do so in a non-disruptive manner. I will impose a substantial grade penalty for those who
distract other students through cell phone use.
Students with disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
