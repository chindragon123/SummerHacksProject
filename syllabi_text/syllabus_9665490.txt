All course materials and instructions will be available online via Canvas--no additional purchases necessary, except possibly a Student subscription to
Adobe CC. (There are free and paid options; see details HERE.)
Course Description:
From presentations to content to case-study videos, today’s brand communicators must know how to create persuasive pieces, using a variety of digital
software tools. This course introduces all students to the fundamentals of good graphic design, as well as production basics. Students will then build their
digital design skills using industry-standard software, from print (Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop) to motion (Adobe Premiere) and interactive (HTML,
CSS, Dreamweaver). Assumes no prior knowledge.
Course Outcomes:
 1. Adobe CC Skills: Ability to use various Adobe professional-level applications to create brand messages.
 2. Craft: How well a message is conceptualized, designed, and constructed digitally.
 3. Visual Communication: Understanding how we communicate visually, in static, motion, and interactive media.

You'll be assigned various projects to learn the theoretical fundamentals as well as practical skills of designing and producing work using various Adobe CC
programs. Each course section includes small projects, quizzes, and a capstone Major Project to demonstrate both your theoretical and hands-on skills.
Minor Daily Projects are simple hands-on projects, quizzes, and video lessons that are graded pass-fail. Major projects allow you more freedom to
demonstrate your growing design skills, carry more grade weight, and are graded more subjectively. (In other words, your creative decisions play a bigger
role in this grade, and sheer amount of work put into a project does not always correlate with the final creative output. This is ultimately a design-oriented
class, and there aren't always clear "right or wrong" answers--only better or weaker creative solutions.)
Grades.
Here’s how your final course grade will be calculated:
60% = 4 Major Projects (15% each; graded)
40% = 12 Daily Projects (4% each; complete/incomplete; lowest 2 grades dropped)
Final letter grades are calculated according to these cutoffs—no exceptions:
A = 94 to 100 A- = 90 to <94 B+ = 87 to <90 B = 87 to <84 B- = 84 to <80 C+ = 80 to <77 C = 77 to <74 C- = 74 to <70 D+ = 70 to <67 D = 67 to
<64 D- = 64 to <61 F = 61 to 0
Policies:
Late Work
As a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry, you are expected to complete every module and project on time – no exceptions. All projects are
due on Canvas at the date and time indicated on the Class Calendar.
Emergencies happen, so you are allowed one “Late Pass” without penalty, which gives you an additional 2 days (48 hours) to complete a single Major
Project. (There is no Late Pass for Daily Projects--your two lowest grades will be dropped.) Once you use your Late Pass, you will not be able to turn in any
late projects under any circumstances, unless you already have a prior exemption for a Religious Holy Day, a school-sponsored trip, or a doctor's note,
obituary, or other issue that you can document with a written excuse.
To use your Late Pass, BEFORE the project is due, click HERE.
Scholastic Dishonesty
The Stan Richards School of Advertising and PR has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. Students who violate University rules on scholastic
dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course an/or dismissal from the University. Please familiarize

E-Mail

announcements, as well as Canvas. You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for University e-mail here
