Gotham and Modern Architecture                     1
Spring 2019
Gotham and Modern Architecture
INSTRUCTOR: Dr. Anthony Alofsin FAIA
TIME AND PLACE: Wednesday, 9:00am – 12:00, WMB 3.116
Course Unique Numbers: ARC 342R (undergrad 00825) and ARC 388R (grad 01110)
Prerequisites:
None. For undergraduate and graduate students interested in historical research in any field
throughout the university. This course is not intended to fulfill the University’s undergraduate
writing component. Maximum Class size: 15
Course Format:
Cities throughout history have been lenses for studying the history of architecture. This
research intensive seminar will look at the arrival and transformation of modern architecture in
New York City from 1900 to 1968. Its themes consider, among other topics, the intersection of
tradition versus modernity, Americanism versus Eurocentrism, and technology versus stylistic
image. Students will make frequent class presentations and pursue a major term-long research
project, the topic of which will be chosen in consultation with the instructor. Parallel the
students’ research the instructor will discuss his own case studies of New York and modern
architecture through the work of Frank Lloyd Wright.
Educational Objectives;
By using the city as a lens cultural, social, and political forces become inseparable from the role
architecture plays in civic and domestic life. Pedagogical goals include creating transcultural
research methods and rigorous structuring of research agendas as well as the development of
critical thinking, articulation of ideas, and exposition of logical arguments.
Evaluation:
Grades will be based on class attendance, participation and quizzes; (thirty percent); assigned
projects (seventy-percent). Class participation is obligatory to receive an optimal grade. In the
case of group projects, students should discuss any particular concepts about credit for work with
the instructor during the semester. Pluses and minus will be used with letter grades as permitted
by University rules. See syllabus for updated details.
EVALUATION CRITERIA
Establishing grades for projects of a creative nature is more complex than grading in other
academic areas. While each project contains certain quantifiable elements by which it may be
evaluated, a significant portion of each grade is derived from a broader, more subjective set of
issues: grasping the ideas and understanding of the project at hand, combined with an appropriate
process of inquiry; process: the consistent and rigorous development and testing of ideas;
resolution: the demonstration of competence, completeness, and finesse through representation.

A student must earn a grade of C or better in order for the course to count toward the degree, and
to progress to the next studio in the School of Architecture. A grade of C- will not satisfy degree
requirements or prerequisites for the design studios that follow.
GRADE DESCRIPTIONS
A/A-                 Excellent
Project surpasses expectations in terms of inventiveness, appropriateness, visual language,
conceptual rigor, craft, and personal development. Student pursues concepts and techniques
above and beyond what is discussed in class. Project is complete on all levels.
B+/B/B-             Above Average
Project is thorough, well presented, diligently pursued, and successfully completed. Student
pursues ideas and suggestions presented in class and puts in effort to resolve required projects.
Project is complete on all levels and demonstrates potential for excellence.
C+/C                  Average
Project meets the minimum requirements. Suggestions made in class and not pursued with
dedication and rigor. Project is incomplete in one or more areas.
C-/D+/D/D-          Poor
Project is incomplete. Basic grasp of skill is lacking, visual clarity or logic of presentation are not
level-appropriate. Student does not demonstrate the required competence and knowledge base.
F                   Fail
Project is unresolved. Minimum objectives are not met. Performance is not acceptable. Note that
this grade will be assigned when you have excessive unexcused absences.
X                Excused Incomplete
Can be given only for legitimate reasons of illness or family emergency. Simply not completing
work on time is not an adequate cause for assigning this evaluation. It may only be used after
consultation with the Associate Deans' offices and with an agreement as to a new completion
date. Work must be completed before the second week of the next semester in which you are
enrolling, according to the School of Architecture policy.
Assignments and Papers
All assignments must be submitted on or before due dates. Any late assignment will be reduced
one letter grade per day of delay. The only excuse for a late assignment is illness confirmed by a
physician's letter or dean’s letter. Instructions on the format of papers will be discussed in class
and included in the course assignments folder on Canvas. Any student taking the course
credit/no-credit will receive a failing grade if he or she does not complete the course
requirements by the assigned dates. Pay special attention to instructions on the medium for
submitting your work. If hard copy printouts are required, then a digital submission is not
acceptable; sometimes both may be required. Submit papers as double-spaced single sided text
with page numbers.
