DESCRIPCIÓN DEL CURSO:
        In this course, we explore how schools influence and are influenced by systems of race, gender,
sexuality, class, and colonialism, and we imagine what it means to teach for social justice. We will
review the histories of African Americans’, Native Americans’, Mexican Americans’, and Asian
Americans’ experiences in schools; consider the complex ways that race, gender, and colonialism
intersect and influence our lives and our society; and explore how teachers can engage students in
transforming their communities through education. Although we focus on schooling and the role of
teachers, the course is relevant for anyone who works or will work in service to youth and communities.
        The course entails a substantial amount of reading and discussion about complex and
emotionally charged topics. We will also continually reflect on how we are positioned in the world, what
mindsets we hold, and how we want to take action in our communities. Students should be prepared to
engage deeply with the course material and in-class activities.
TEXTOS REQUÍSITOS:
    • Angela Valenzuela, Subtractive Schooling
    • Course Reader from Jenn’s Copies
TAREAS PRINCIPALES:
Todas las tareas se deben entregar en el sitio de Canvas.
    • Participación (15%)
    • Servicio (15%)
    • Mini-Proyectos (15%)
    • Reflexiones Semanales (40%)
    • Autobiografía de la Educación (15%)
Participación (15%): The central components of the course are the readings, discussion, and service
learning. You will receive credit for discussion participation for coming to class prepared to discuss the
readings, for listening attentively to classmates, and for contributing your own perspectives and insights
to class discussions. I will assign discussion participation grades at 3 points throughout the semester.
Servicio (15%): In order to engage in a cycle of reflection and action, you are required to complete at
least 15 hours of service learning during the course of the semester. It is your responsibility to arrange
and attend these service hours with an approved organization from the list provided in class, or to secure
instructor approval to begin or continue service learning with an organization that is not on the list. You
must track your service learning hours each time that you attend and receive a signature from the
supervising staff member. After each visit to your service learning organization, it is recommended that
you take informal notes on what happened during your service learning and how you felt / what you
were thinking about in order to prepare for your Service Learning Reflection. Service learning is a


mandatory component of the course and you will not be permitted to pass the course without completing
the required hours.
Mini-Proyectos de Servicio (15%): The service learning mini-projects provide an opportunity to put the
course readings into action and to practice culturally relevant public service. You will be doing some on-
site work for each mini-project and can count each as one hour of service. For each project, you will
turn in a 3- to 4-page, double-spaced 12 pt. Times New Roman paper responding to the assignment
prompt.
     • Mini-Proyecto 1: Entrevista. For this assignment, you will arrange a minimum 20-minute
         interview with a parent or community leader/elder to learn about 1) their family history or
         community history, 2) their values in regards to education and schooling, and 3) their or their
         family’s funds of knowledge. Your purpose is to identify this family or community member’s
         culturally-rooted “assets” and forms of “smartness” and, if you are lucky, to learn about the
         family’s or community’s history of resilience and resistance. You will prepare an explanation of
         the assignment and a list of questions, to be reviewed by the instructor in advance of the
         interview. Please select a parent or community member who is comfortable speaking with you
         (even if through an interpreter) and who is comfortable with you recording or taking notes in
         order to complete your class assignment. Plan to share a copy of your notes and your written
         paper with the person you interview. In your paper, you will describe the person you
         interviewed, what you learned from them, and how this knowledge could inform your service
         work in the community.
     • Mini-Proyecto 2: Caminata por la comunidad. For this assignment, you will go on a minimum
         30-minute walk through the neighborhood surrounding your service learning site and take photos
         of at least 5 community assets, forms of cultural wealth, and/or funds of knowledge. In your
         paper, you will explain what these 5 assets tell you about the community, and you will reflect on
         your experience of walking through the neighborhood. For example, you may find that you
         initially focus on the community deficits, in which case you can use the paper to engage in a
         process of positive re-framing.
Reflexiones Semanales: Within a day following class (by 9 AM on Thursdays), you will turn in a 3- to 5-
sentence argument summary of each reading or chapter, followed by a 1-paragraph critical reflection.
You can use the guiding questions to help you identify the relevant argument(s) in each reading. In your
critical reflection, you may describe how historical or current events help you to understand the reading,
how the reading helps you to understand historical or current events, how the reading changes the way
you understand yourself or motivates you to act differently, or how you would question/challenge the
reading or push it further. These assignments will be scored on the accuracy, depth, and
comprehensiveness of the argument summaries, and the engagement shown in the reflection. A rubric
will be provided on Canvas. I recommend that you write the summaries and write a draft reflection
before attending class, then revise your summaries and build upon your reflection after the class
discussion.
Autobiografía de la Educación (15%): In this 4- to 6-page paper, in conversation with the course
readings and course themes, you will write about the sociocultural influences on your K-12 schooling
experiences, paying specific attention to the way that race, class, and gender affected your education, the
way that your schooling experiences shape your beliefs and expectations today, and the ways that you


can enact transformative change in the world from your own situated position. Detailed instructions will
be provided in class and a rubric will be available on Canvas.
POLICÍAS DEL CURSO:
Asistencia: Following the policy of the teacher education program, you are permitted one excused
absence during the semester. Each unexcused absence or additional absence will result in losing ¾ of a
letter grade (or 7.5 percentage points) from your final grade. If you miss more than three classes, you
will receive a failing grade in the course. Please communicate with the instructor as soon as possible in
the event of an emergency.
         You will not be penalized for missing class on religious holy days. A student who misses classes
or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should
inform the instructor, in writing, at least one week before the absence, so that alternative arrangements
can be made to complete work. If you know you will have to miss class(es) for this reason, provide your
instructor with the date(s) as early as possible. Please note that the University specifies very few other
excused absences (e.g., jury duty).
         The instructor is not responsible for updating you on the material that was covered during class if
you were not present. You are responsible for learning about notes and assignments from a classmate or
from the course website.
Late Assignments: Grades for all assignments will be reduced by 10% for each day they are late and will
not be accepted more than 3 days late. Students can potentially receive extensions, at the instructor’s
discretion, if they make the request at least 24 hours before the due date.
Scholastic Honesty
         Turning in work that is not your own, or any other form of scholastic dishonesty, will result in a
major course penalty, possibly failure of the course. This standard applies to all drafts and assignments,
and a report of the incident will be submitted to the Office of the Dean of Students and filed in your
permanent UT record. Under certain circumstances, the Dean of Students will initiate proceedings to
expel you from the University.
         So, take care to read and understand the Statement on Scholastic Responsibility, which can be
found online at http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/rhetoric/firstyearwriting/plagiarismcollusion.php If
you have any doubts about your use of sources, ask your instructor for help before handing in the
assignment.
Students with Disabilities
         Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should
contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video
phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations. More
information is available on the Services for Students with Disabilities website at
http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/
E-mail Accounts
         Email is an official means of communication at UT-Austin, and your instructor will use this
medium to communicate class information. You are therefore required to obtain a UT email account and
to check it daily. All students may claim an email address at no cost by going to the IT Services website
at https://get.utmail.utexas.edu/.
