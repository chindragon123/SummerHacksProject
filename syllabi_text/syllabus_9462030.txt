Course Description
This graduate seminar course provides an introduction to contemporary theories of persuasion
that guide advertising campaigns and persuasive communications. We aim to understand why
consumers respond to persuasive messages the way they do, and learn how to be effective in
persuading them. We will review representative works from advertising/PR, health
communication, persuasion, and mass communication fields, and translate theoretical concepts
from these fields to designing a successful advertising campaign for a local client.
Course Objectives
At the end of the course, students will be able to:
    1. apply persuasion theories and concepts to solving advertising issues,
    2. understand how to derive effective communication strategies for advertising, public
        relations, and promotions from persuasion theories, and
    3. think theoretically and analytically.

Instructional Approach
The format of this course combines lecture with active discussion/participation. Students are
expected to complete assigned readings prior to each class meeting in order to actively
participate.
Course Requirements
                                  Digital Portfolio Project (33%)
You will work in a small group to prepare a state-of-the-art digital portfolio applying a
persuasion theory to the advertising/marketing practice of your chosen local client.
Semester Portfolio Assignments (28%). This portion of your grade includes choosing a local
client and a persuasion theory, interviewing the client, applying the theory to the client’s
advertising needs (5%), proposing an advertising/marketing/PR campaign or strategy through a
digital portfolio that addresses both the client’s needs and the theory’s persuasion potential
(20%), and a confidential peer review score (3%). Your digital portfolio must be useful to inspire
your client’s advertising/marketing practice, summarizing your proposed campaign strategy.
More details will be provided in class.
Final Presentation (5%). To assess and demonstrate the professional relevance of your chosen
theory, your team will “pitch” your chosen theory and the campaign idea based on the theory as
your final presentation.
                                             Exams (40%)
There will be two exams scheduled during the semester. It will cover materials presented in
readings, lecture slides, and in-class exercises. If you are unable to take the exam at the
scheduled time and location, you need to notify me at least two weeks prior to the test. Failure
to take a test will result in the grade of F. No questions about the test the day before it.
                                 Ad Example Assignments (16%)
You are required to read all the assigned journal articles and the textbook chapter every
week. After reading them, choose one of the readings and locate one advertisement example
(e.g., TV commercial, magazine ad, campaign website, mobile/social media ad, etc.) that
illustrates the main point of the article or the book chapter. In less than a double-spaced page,
you should provide (a) a Web link to your example and (b) a brief written explanation of how
your example addresses your chosen reading’s main point as well as the theory for the week.
You cannot use examples in your readings. For Ad Example Assignment 2, you will use one
of this year’s Super Bowl commercials to do the assignment.
The assignment is due by 11:59 pm on the Thursday before we discuss the readings. Class
discussion in the following week will center around selected examples.
You may submit 8 assignments (i.e., each assignment is 2% of your grade). No late assignment
is accepted under any circumstances.
                                                   2


                                  Journal Article Presentation (5%)
In a small group, students will prepare a presentation that summarizes an advertising research
article. The presentation should include (a) the article’s theoretical background, (b) method and
major findings, and (c) your own ideas on how to use the findings and the persuasion theory to
design advertising/marketing materials. The presentation should be less than 10 minutes.
Each week, up to two groups will perform presentations. You will be randomly assigned to one
of the articles in the reading list. A powerpoint and a one-page handout that summarizes your
presentation should be submitted due by 11:59 pm on the Saturday before the scheduled
presentation to CANVAS. You are encouraged to meet up with the course assistant to discuss
your presentation beforehand. On the presentation day, the group will print out/distribute the
handout, and lead discussion after the presentation.
                                          Attendance (3%)
Attendance will be taken every day. For the third and fourth absences, your final grade will
be dropped a letter grade. For instance, if you missed three classes and had earned a B grade,
you will receive a C grade for the course. The 5th absence constitutes F for the course.
I expect you to arrive in class on time and to stay for the entire class. Three unexcused, tardy
arrivals will be considered one absence. A random exit will be considered an unexcused
absence.
In extremely rare circumstances, students may be unable to attend class due to serious illness or
crises. These situations will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. In general, notice must be
given to me at least 24 hours before the absence occurs. Excused absences may be due to a
work conflict (confirmation should be presented in advance), illness (a doctor’s excuse should be
provided at the first opportunity) or legitimate emergency situation. You are responsible for
any assignments given and all work missed when absent or late.
                                       Class Participation (3%)
Your active presence in class is vital to meeting the course requirements. Students are expected
to actively participate in class discussion. Doing your readings and receiving high scores on
ad example assignments can facilitate your active class participation.
Laptop use in lecture is strongly discouraged. Using your laptop or tablet to take notes often
leads to checking email and social media or browsing the internet. This hinders your learning and
has also been shown to distract those around you (https://www.brookings.edu/research/for-
better-learning-in-college-lectures-lay-down-the-laptop-and-pick-up-a-pen/). If a student is
found engaged in any of these distracting activities, s/he will get zero attendance score for
the class. Phones must be in silent mode and all technology (except for taking notes or
performing in-class activity on your laptop) must be put away during the class.
Late Work Policy
No late work will be accepted for the ad example assignment, semester portfolio, and final
presentation. Except for these, I may accept late work, but you will automatically lose 50% of
your score. Software, network or storage device failure is not a valid excuse for late work. No
assignment will be accepted two weeks past the due date.

Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/index.php)
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning
process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and
submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and
must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and
readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Policy on Religious Holy Days Observance
(http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi03-04/ch4/ch4g.html#attendance)
The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student
from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of
a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under
this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an
examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable
time after the absence.
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence
as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable
time after the absence.
Students with Disabilities (http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd)
Please notify your instructor of any modification/adaptation you may require to accommodate a
disability-related need. You will be requested to provide documentation to the Dean of Student's
Office in order that the most appropriate accommodations can be determined. Specialized
services are available on campus through Services for Students with Disabilities.
