AMS 310/HIS 315G is an introductory course in American Studies, a field that examines American
culture and society from multiple perspectives. Using a variety of sources and methods, this
course takes as its focal point American attitudes regarding place, landscape, community, nature,
and the physical environment as demonstrative of social values both historic and current,
dominant and resistant. This course examines a number of major conceptual categories
connecting the North American continent and the people who have inhabited it, such as
landscape and the physical environment, people and place, and community and place-making,
each of which demonstrates great transformations in American society, culture, and everyday
life, while also showing main currents and trajectories over time. The interdisciplinary approach
of this course draws upon history, geography, sociology, literature, popular culture, and other
methods of inquiry to reveal a history fraught with political and social conflicts that complicate
narratives of national consensus.


Class format: This is primarily a lecture course but I encourage questions and discussion.
Learning is collaborative!
Supplemental Instruction (SI): SI consists of optional discussion sections led by one of the course
TAs, Holly Genovese. These sessions will help reinforce and clarify course content plus help you
to learn the material more effectively. SI also gives you a smaller forum for discussing course
content and getting to know your classmates. Regular participation in SI discussion, although
optional, has been shown to improve students’ performance by an average of one-half to one full
letter grade higher than the class mean.
Requirements: Regular attendance, completion of all reading and assignments, three exams.
Goals/outcomes: As members of this intellectual community, you will:
1. Gain a greater understanding of people, places, groups, events, and ideas throughout
American history how they have impacted American culture and society in their time and in ours.
2. Engage with a variety of types of texts and evidence to become interdisciplinary interpreters of
American history.
3. Build critical thinking and analysis skills through written expression, including constructing
thesis statements and supporting your argument with evidence from lecture and readings.
Grading:
First exam                      20%     Tue Oct 1, in class

Final exam                      40%     Day, time, location TBA (between Dec 12 and Dec 18)
Reading quizzes                 5%      Dates variable, in class
Grading scale: A 93-100; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76; C- 70-72; D+
67-69; D 63-66; D- 60-62; F 0-59
Exam format: All exams will be closed book/notes. Exam I will consist of six identification
questions (choice of 10) and Exam II will consist of one essay (choice of 2). There will be a review
session held before each exam. The final exam will contain five (5) identification questions
(choice of 15) and one essay (choice of 2). The IDs on the final will be taken from the last third of
the course but the essay will require you to integrate and synthesize material from the entire
semester to construct your analysis. On all tests, you will be expected to write your essay answers
with supporting evidence from the assigned readings and lectures. For this reason, regular class
attendance is crucial in order to do well in the course. Do not rely on the inevitable Google doc as
a substitute for reading or attending lecture. I do not intend to post lecture slides to Canvas.
Make-up policy: Failure to take a scheduled exam without making prior arrangements with me
will result in an automatic zero for that exam. I will allow you to take a make-up exam only in the
event of a medical or family emergency, or if you have official, documented University of Texas at
Austin business outside of campus. In both cases, you must notify me BEFORE the scheduled
exam, unless extraordinary circumstances while traveling to the exam dictate otherwise, in which
case official documentation will still be required. All make-up exams must be taken at 8 a.m. one
week after the scheduled exam.
Post-exam protocol: If you would like the TA to review your exam after it has been graded,
please carefully review the comments and wait a minimum of 24 hours before contacting the TA.
Thereafter, make sure to address all questions about your grade within eight days after you have
received your exam back. If you do not reach an understanding with the TA, then I will be happy


to review your exam as well. Please keep your exams as they will help you as you review for the
final exam.
Required readings: Required texts will be in the course reader, available for purchase at Jenn’s
Copies (2518 Guadalupe St). I encourage each of you to be active readers and interact with the
texts by underlining, highlighting, and engaging with the texts as you see fit. Some readings are
available online via Canvas. Please show up to class ready to discuss the assigned texts.
Attendance: Students are expected to attend class regularly and to participate as best they can in
such a sizable class. While no record of attendance will be kept, being in class consistently and
doing the assigned reading are essential to satisfactory performance in the class. To ensure this,
unannounced reading quizzes will be given in class periodically, constituting 5% of the overall
grade. Bring 3x5 notecards to class each day to be prepared for reading quizzes.
Office hours: I encourage you to come to office hours during the semester so you can get the
most out of the course. This is an opportunity for you to discuss exam expectations, aspects of
the lecture material or readings, or just to say hello.
Devices: Laptops and tablets in class must remain silent and may not be used for any reason
other than course-related material (this should go without saying, but no phones are to be used
in class). I trust you to use technology responsibly, but failure to abide by this policy may result in
the revocation of in-class laptop/tablet privileges at my discretion.
Communication: Course-related announcements, relevant or interesting links, potential changes
to the course schedule, and other important information will be posted to the course Canvas site
(and therefore sent to you via email), so please check your email at least once per day. All emails
sent to me will be responded to within 24 hours of receipt unless unforeseen circumstances arise.
Classroom conduct: This course is built upon discussing topics that are often controversial and
difficult. I encourage all of you to share your informed opinions, feeling, and experiences, and to
engage in conversations that invite productive and respectful disagreement. As such, we all must
maintain respect for the classroom environment and for our colleagues. Be willing to have your
own points of view challenged and be willing to respectfully challenge others. The most
productive and exciting intellectual growth emerges from engaging with diverse opinions.
Flags: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity
courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American
cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come
from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one U.S. cultural group
that has experienced persistent marginalization. This course also fulfills the history core
curriculum requirement.
Students with disabilities: Any student with a documented disability who requires academic
accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259
(voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty members are not required to provide
accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.
Academic honesty: In an effort to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and integrity in the
classroom, cheating and plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. Cheating or plagiarism will
result in an automatic zero for the assignment and will be reported to the Dean of Students.
University policies regarding academic honesty are available at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php
TL;DR version: show up to class consistently, be respectful of each other, put phones away, use
laptops for class-related stuff only, don’t cheat on quizzes or exams.
