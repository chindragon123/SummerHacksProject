I. Course Description
This course is a hands-on introduction to Digital Humanities, which may be defined as “a nexus of fields within
which scholars use computing technologies to investigate the kinds of questions that are traditional to the
humanities, or. . . [ask] humanities-oriented questions about computing technologies” (Kathleen Fitzpatrick,
“Reporting from the Digital Humanities 2010 Conference,” ProfHacker). What are these questions? As usual, it
depends, depends on the scholar’s theoretical orientation, methods, and resources at hand (including not only
primary source materials, but time, skill, and support). This course will include learning to evaluate DH questions
and DH projects through project-based exercises in creating and interpreting digital humanities resources and tools
and a close (and critical) look at the infrastructural, institutional, and political issues involved in interrogating “the
digital” in the humanities. As we look at the concepts, methods, theories, and resources of DH through the
perspective of practice, we will consider how computational methods are being used to further humanities research
and how our understanding of computing technologies is deepened by humanities research.
No prerequisites are required for this course.
II. Specific Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will:
  • Learn an overview of Digital Humanities history and the most common (or most controversial) methods,
      practices, and technologies
  • Be introduced to the theory and practice as well as the public discourse of Digital Humanities through learning
      to use and think critically about various standards, applications, and tools
  • Express ideas in class discussions and projects in ways that can be understood by scholars in the multiple fields
      involved in Digital Humanities projects
  • Learn to teach workshops, new technologies, and thinking through new technologies
  • Hone teamwork skills
  • Prepare and write grants in Digital Humanities
III. Format and Procedures
This is a seminar-style course, so attendance and participation in class are critical to individual success in this course
and to the success of the course as a whole. Students should come to class prepared to participate in small group and
class discussions, completing all required readings prior to class, and submitting discussion questions on time.
Students will also work independently and in teams to complete a variety of course projects. These projects will
combine individual accountability with collaboration. The success of this course will depend on everyone’s
preparation and willingness to share their ideas and opinions, which requires mutual understanding and respect.
Students are welcome to express ideas that are different from their peers or the instructor, politely and
professionally, and in a constructive manner.

V. Course Requirements
   Class attendance and participation (5%)
   1. Class attendance is required. One unexcused absence is granted, but all other absences will only be excused in
       situations following university policy (illness, religious holy days, participation in University activities at the
       request of university authorities, and compelling absences beyond the student’s control) with proper
       documentation and timely notification (prior to class for non-emergencies). Excessive tardiness may be
       considered an unexcused absence. Two unexcused absences will cost two percentage points. More than two
       unexcused absences may result in a dropped letter grade.
   2. Class participation is not merely attendance, but reflects the student’s overall contributions to the
       collaborative learning environment, based on the quantity and quality of their interactions with fellow
       classmates, the instructor, and in the online discussions.
   3. Religious Holy Days: By UT Austin policy, students must notify the instructor of pending absences at least
       fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. Students who must miss a class, an
       examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, will be given an
       opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
   Discussion Questions (20%)
   Goal: Students will demonstrate a familiarity and/or an understanding of all the readings required for the week
   by posing questions and/or responses that provoke thoughtful class discussions.
   Except when indicated, there will be required readings each week. The required readings will either be available
   online or posted on Canvas, so there are no books to buy or papers to acquire for the class.
   Over the course of the semester, students are required to post 10 discussion posts in total, but in the first weeks
   of the semester, discussion posts are required of all students. Posts are due in Canvas by midnight the day
   before class meets and should begin as a question or questions that reflect a careful reading of the material for
   that week and seek to stimulate thoughtful class discussion. Students will post a thoughtful response to his or her
   own discussion questions. Responses should touch on a majority of the readings for full credit. The length of
   the post depends on how long it takes the student to generate a response that takes all the readings into account.
   Lab Assignments (10%)
   Goal: Students will demonstrate an ability to use a variety of digital tools. Students will also learn to evaluate a
   workshop. Students will complete assignments for all the workshops they are not running.
   Workshop Curriculum (25%)
   Goal: Students will design, implement, and review a workshop focused on teaching a digital humanities tool to a
   class of information professionals using selected data. Ultimately, the students will produce a proposal to run a
   workshop. There will be three assignments (each is 1-2 pages):
   1. Workshop Proposal (10%)
   2. Workshop Plan (7.5%)

    Late Assignment Policy
    All assignments are due according to the due dates and times on Canvas. All assignments must be submitted via
    Canvas. Late assignments will only be excused in situations following university policy (illness, religious holy
    days, etc.) with proper documentation and timely notification (prior to the deadline for non-emergencies). In all
    other cases, assignments received after the deadline will be penalized 10% per 24-hour period. If an assignment
    is turned in (without prior authorization or extreme emergency circumstances) even one minute late, an
    automatic deduction of 10% prior to grading of the assignment will occur; if five days late, even an otherwise
    perfect assignment will only receive half-credit; and if ten days late, 5h3 assignment will not be graded and will
    not receive any credit.
VII. Academic Integrity
    University of Texas Honor Code
    The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
    opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through
    integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
    Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code. [See the UT Honor
    Code above.] Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student’s own work,
    although collaboration is allowed and required for some assignments.
VIII. Other University Notices and Policies
     Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence
    All students should become familiar with the University’s official e-mail student notification policy. It is the
    student’s responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or her e-mail address. Students are
    expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related
    communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be
    checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this policy and instructions for updating
    your e-mail address are available at http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564 .
Documented Disability Statement

    Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty are not
    required to provide accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.

        instructional videos need captioning, course packets are not readable for proper alternative text conversion,
        etc.).
    • Please notify me as early in the semester as possible if disability-related accommodations for field trips are
        required. Advanced notice will permit the arrangement of accommodations on the given day (e.g.,
        transportation, site accessibility, etc.).
    • Contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone) or

Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is
activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
    • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest exit
       door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
    • If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
    • In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
    • Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin
       Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
