                            and services or earn new consumers. It is a business advantage that anyone with

TA                          We are not going to argue the validity of a consumer segment’s race, religion,
                            sexuality or ethnicity’s point of view. The consumer is the expert on themselves.

Email                       We are not going to record this class in any way. The ability to explore these
                            topics requires your classmates to speak freely, ask questions and to be

                            We are not going to focus on diversity in advertising.

 Exercises (30%)
 I’ll give a topic in class and everyone will contribute. For example, Find an example of a classic symbol of
 America. It can be an icon, product, song, culture, saying and anything else. Listen for the specified format:
 submit a slide, upload to Canvas or arrive in class prepared to discuss.
 I am going to introduce you to industry professionals who will have assorted POV on Cultural Fluency. You will
 write a one double spaced, 10 pt., Times-ish font of thoughtful response. Students may be called upon to discuss
 their response in class.
 When I ask for a response, do not summarize the material. Tell me how it expanded your understanding of
 branding. Connect it to other concepts in class or in other classes. Link it to your own explorations in Cultural
 Fluency. Suggest how you might apply this in other coursework or assignments.
 These are just a few examples. But this is advertising … I could assign anything.
 Final Project Presentation (60%)
 You will work in small groups. Do not submit a beautifully designed deck with no substance. I would rather have
 a plain deck that is strategic, thoughtful, organized and persuasive. (Presentation 20% Final Deck 40%)
 Participation and Attendance (10%)
 I’m looking for quality as well as quantity here. Qin and I have a system. We are looking for you to demonstrate
 insights on the readings and other course material plus your performance when called upon in class. Poor
 attendance will affect your grade.

 No late work will be accepted. Qin is the keeper of the assignments. Turn things in on time, please. We will be
 moving at a fairly quick pace and many assignments will become pointless after the deadline as the material has
 been incorporated into the next class. If something comes up that prevents you from attending class and working
 on the day's activity, it is in your best interest to contact the professor or TA prior to class time.

         Although I teach cultural fluency as a creative director, this is my first time formally distilling the practice
         into a course for university students. This means that I’m designing exercises and assigning readings in
         response to our time together in class. That makes your presence and participation in class very important.
         Thank you for choosing to explore this subject with me.
