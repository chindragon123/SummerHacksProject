I. COURSE DESCRIPTION
How do societies remember complex, traumatic and existential events? This course looks at
the manifold ways in which the wars of the 20th and 21st century are remembered in Germany
and the United States - from poems, novels and films to monuments and the controversial
debates about military conflicts that the two countries have been involved in. Based on
theories of social memory, concepts of individual and social mourning and more political
approaches such as necropolitics we will analyze how individuals, groups and societies
remember the events and experiences of war. We will analyze how war affects individual life
stories, how societies mourn, how remembering war may have an impact on national identity,
and how war memories become a way to make political demands for the future. Every student
will have the opportunity to work in-depth and individually on either an event, for example
the Vietnam war, or on a genre, for example poems, film or political texts.
The course aims at enabling students to understand central theories and concepts of memory
studies and to familiarize them with the cultural and social scientific definitions and research
perspectives on war, death, trauma, mourning and political activism. At the end of the course,
students will have a thorough theoretical and empirical understanding of the ways in which
memory and war intersect both as research fields and as cultural, societal and political
practices in contemporary societies. Students will be able to independently design a case study,
to identify a relevant research question and to carry out a small research project.
                                                                                               1


III. COURSE MATERIALS
Readings for each class meeting are on canvas. For your research project you will be asked to
research additional literature. Our Canvas site is accessible to each of you at
https://courses.utexas.edu or through your UT Direct account. Assignments, e-mail
reminders and updates will be sent through Canvas. Please check them regularly.
IV. GRADING AND ASSIGNMENTS
 Students will be graded on a 100-point scale which includes + and -:
 A      100 %        to 93.0%
 A-     < 93.0 %     to 90.0%
 B+     < 90.0 %     to 87.0%
 B      < 87.0 %     to 83.0%
 B-     < 83.0 %     to 80.0%
 C+     < 80.0 %     to 77.0%
 C      < 77.0 %     to 73.0%
 C-     < 73.0 %     to 70.0%
 D+     < 70.0 %     to 67.0%
 D      < 67.0 %     to 63.0%
 D-     < 63.0 %     to 60.0%
 F      < 60.0 %     to 0.0%
Each student will moderate the discussion of a text, participate in a working group on methods
or a genre and carry out his/her individual research project and present it as a written brief in
class. Your grade will be determined based on the following:
                                                                                                2


Moderator/discussion leader: 20 percent
Presentation of vignette of your research project: 20 percent
War and Memory brief: 30 percent
Short written and oral comment on somebody else’s brief: 20 percent
Homework: 10 percent
1. Moderator/discussion leader
Teams of students will be assigned to moderate the discussion on one of the theoretical texts
of the course. These moderators/discussion leaders will prepare a short introduction to the
text (10 minutes, informal oral presentation) and a handout with questions for the class. The
handout will be uploaded on canvas two days before the class meeting. Questions should be
about the content of the reading but they should also be thought provoking, and encourage a
discussion on how the text is helpful for better understanding connections between memory
and war and how the text might help to identify research questions and topics.
2. Vignette presentation
Presentation of the starting point for your research project, a single case, for example a poem,
a person, a monument, that represents the broader topic of your research.
3. Memory and War Brief (2-3 pages)
Written summary and oral presentation of your research project. We will talk about the
details in class. Please use a minimum of 4 scholarly sources
4. Comment on somebody else’s Memory and War brief
Ten minute oral comment on content, sharing ideas and questions that brief raises
5. Homework
Presenting your homework in class, posting your homework on discussion threads, sharing
ideas and questions related to your homework in class
                                                                                               3

VI. OTHER INFORMATION
Religious Holy Days and other absences
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior
to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a
work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
The same applies to official university obligations like Club or Varsity sports.
Attendance policy
You are allowed three unexcused absences during the semester. Any additional unexcused
absence will lead to a reduction of your grade by 0.2 points.
Please send me an email if you miss class because of a medical reason, If you miss classes for
longer than a week due to medical reasons, please provide documentation from a physician.
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you will need to execute a Q drop before
the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas
law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution.
