                                      Course Description
Is there a God? Are there reasons to believe or not to believe in a God?
     This course surveys and at the same time evaluates arguments for and against the existence of God in Jewish,
Christian, and Islamic traditions, along with arguments for Brahman (Hinduism) and
Emptiness (Buddhism). The course takes a global point of view, comparing arguments
proferred originally in Arabic, for example, with medieval arguments expressed in
Latin and with a collection of arguments originally expressed in Sanskrit.
     We will examine the primary atheistic arguments in the West from Epicurus
through Bertrand Russell and in India principally from a philosopher of the eighth
century named Kumarila Bhatta.
     We will also consider differing concepts of God. An important Buddhist argument
purports to prove the Buddha's omniscience. But the Buddhist idea of omniscience
differs from the mainstream view of God's omniscience in the West.
     Our main focus throughout the course will be on the strengths and weaknesses of
each argument. We will examine passages from a wide variety of thinkers, including
Aristotle, Epicurus, Paul, Augustine, Kumarila Bhatta, al-Farabi, ibn Sina (Avicenna), Anselm, Udayana, al-
Ghazali, ibn Rushd (Averroes), Aquinas, Keśava Miśra, Gangesa, Descartes, Leibniz, Paley, Hume, and Gödel, as
well as some contemporary articles illuminating the structure of the arguments.
