                               Summer 2020, First Session – Unique ID 85515
  Instructor:  Dr. Kirk Blazek
  Lecture:     MTWThF 10-11:15 via Zoom
Catalog Description: Techniques of matrix calculations and applications of linear algebra.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 408C, 408K, or 408N with a grade of at least C-.
Text: Lay, Linear Algebra and its applications, 5th Edition, Addison Wesley.
Lectures: Live lectures will be broadcast through Zoom (whose link is provided in the Canvas page for
the class). For people who are unable to attend lecture or experience any issues during the live broadcast,
the lecture will be recorded and posted on Canvas. If you attend the live lecture, you are welcome to ask
questions through text chat.
Piazza: Instead of usual live office hours, everyone in class has been invited to a Piazza page where people
are welcome to ask questions. It is meant to be a place where questions about the class can be resolved by
fellow students, the TA, or the teacher. If you would prefer a more in-person discussion, I’m always happy
to stay a bit after the regular class time and ask questions, or you can schedule a time to have a meeting
via Zoom.
Homework: Problem sets will be assigned twice a week through Quest, https://quest.cns.utexas.edu/
The homework will be due Tuesday and Friday at midnight central time. One homework will be dropped
at the end of the class.
Exams: This course will have a midterm and a final. The midterm will be given on Tuesday, June 23rd
and the final will be on Friday, July 10th. The exams will be posted on Canvas, to be completed and
turned in as .pdfs. You will be given 24 hours to do the exam, but they will be written as though they
were to be done in the usual class time, i.e., 1 hour and 15 minutes for the midterm, 2 hours for the final.
No late submissions will be accepted, so it is important to submit your solutions well before the deadline
in case you run into any technical issues.
Grading: This class is graded on the +/- scale. The overall grade will be determined by the exams and
the homework.
     An A will be given for an overall grade of 93 and up, an A- is given for 90-93, a B+ for 87-90, a B for
83-87, a B- for 80-83, etc. Please note that since the grade ranges for most of the grades are 3 or 4 points,
there is not much rounding (e.g., an 86.5 is still a B, but an 86.95 will round to a B+).
