Description and Goals
This course surveys the history of the Middle East from the rise of Islam to the end of the
fifteenth century. Students will be introduced to basic aspects of the political, social, and
cultural dimensions of Islamic civilization from Spain to Iran in fulfillment of a Global
Cultures Flag. The GC Flag is designed to increase your familiarity with cultural groups
outside the United States.
In the midst of mapping this broad view, we will focus our attention on how specific
historical figures and events contributed to definitions of Islamic identity, community, and
authority. Central themes include the emergence of Sunni and Shi‘i identities, the
relationship of Muslims and non-Muslims, and the unique material and intellectual
contributions of Islamic civilization to world history and other societies.
An overarching goal of this course is to focus attention on the history of the Middle East in
this formative phase as a fascinating, complicated, and enriching study in its own right. In
order to do this, students will be expected to master key terms and concepts of the period.
