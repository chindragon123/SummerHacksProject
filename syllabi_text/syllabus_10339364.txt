Course Description
As the title suggests, this seminar is divided into three segments, each four weeks long.
The first segment, Space, will follow the thinking of the famous ecological perception
psychologist James J. Gibson. We will read parts of The Senses Considered as Perceptual
Systems, with supplementary material by the instructor. We will also study isovist theory,
becoming acquainted with the application ISOVIST 2.3, with which students will be encouraged
to experiment.
The second segment, Object, will revolve around reading contemporary philosopher Graham
Harman (principally, Art and Objects), some essays in CENTER 21: The Secret Life of
Buildings, and Alphonso Lingis's Excesses: Eros and Culture.
The third segment, Relation, will revolve around philosopher Martin Buber's I and Thou as well
as neuroscientist Michael Graziano's Consciousness and the Social Brain, in readings from the
instructor's new book, Architecture Beyond Experience, which will come out in March.
Students will be asked to present two (out of three possible) "Show & Tells," about 15 minutes
long, and a paper (around 5 pages long) that documents their Show & Tell. They will also be
asked to produce one final paper of around 10 pages which attempts to bring all three topics of
the course together or amplifies an earlier Show & Tell. All papers can be traditional written
essays, or documented experiments, or artworks accompanied by explanatory and speculative
writing.
The intention of 'Space, Object, Relation' is to deepen student's thinking about architecture
both as designer/artist/architects as well as appreciator/user/critics: i.e., as creative
professionals as well as philosophers. Because 'Space, Object, Relation' is a graduate seminar
with upper-division undergraduate participation, students taking it need to be committed doing
all the readings and to full attendance and participation in class. More than one absence will
result in a half letter-grade reduction per absence.
