                                        COURSE DESCRIPTION
 “All the bridges between our today and our yesterday and our yesteryears have been burnt.”
                                                Stefan Zweig, 1943
“Memories are built as a city is built.
                                                Umberto Eco, 1986
“The city, however, does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, written in the
corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps, the antennae of
the lightning rods, the poles of the flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches,
indentations, scrolls.”                         Italo Calvino, 1974
Among the world’s major cities, Vienna, Austria, stands out as a place where the past remains a
uniquely powerful shaper of collective identity—an identity that is also shaped by equally
powerful forces to forget that very past. The urban landscapes of Vienna have long been
inscribed by layers of collective remembering and forgetting: the city’s famous nineteenth-
century Ringstraße, with its monumental government, educational, religious, and cultural
institutions was constructed with memories of older building traditions clearly in mind; while
avant-garde architects and artists who followed explicitly rejected connections to the past.
From Sigmund Freud’s influential theories of the psychological unconscious to Ludwig
Wittgenstein’s efforts to create a distinctly ahistorical philosophical system, Viennese thinkers
have been at the vanguard of debates about the power of memory. And the profound
upheavals of the Second World War and the Holocaust further fractured collective
remembering, leading to Vienna’s deep ambivalence to recent history. Today’s Vienna, fully
immersed in a global political-economy, bears witness to the deep impress of the past in the
contemporary world.
The purpose of this course is to study the ways in which cultural memory has shaped, and
continues to shape, urban life in one specific place: Vienna, Austria. For individuals and groups
alike, memory forms an essential component of their social identity; by definition, it involves
sharing, discussion, negotiation, and conflict. Cultural memory is produced in various forms—
from memorials, public art, and commodities to popular culture, rituals, and museums—and is
inevitably anchored in cities. Museums and memorials, for example, have been historically built
as official places of memory in prominent cities to communicate a sense of national history and
citizenship. Yet, due to the distinct interests of diverse social groups, these urban pasts are
open to multiple interpretations that, in many cases, lead to willful and organized forgetting.
Our study of cultural memory in Vienna will explore the city’s changing cultural landscapes
during four important periods during its modern development. We will see, for example, how
the different layers of Austria’s history have literally become part of the Viennese built
environment. We will also visit the many museums that house the artifacts and visual culture so
                                                    2


important to Vienna’s collective memory, and we will attend musical performances that call
forth the city’s unique heritage. This kind of direct exploration, and the course requirement of
daily reflections on these structures and spaces, can only be done on-location, where students
can explore the terrain of memory. With Vienna as our laboratory, students will examine
theoretical discussions of memory and the city in a provocative geographical setting.

Our Host Institution
This Maymester course is fortunate to enjoy, as its host institution, IES Abroad Vienna, one of
the oldest and most experienced study-abroad programs in Europe. Located in an elegant
eighteenth-century palace in the center of the old imperial district of Vienna, it houses the
largest library of any study-abroad program in Europe, a computer laboratory with e-mail
access for every student, as well as a concert hall, classrooms, offices, and lounges. IES will be
the setting for daily German language classes and some of our discussions and lectures.
Contact information: International Education of Students, Palais Corbelli, Johannesgasse 7, A-
1010 Wien, Austria.
Phone: +43.1.512.2601
On Thursday, May 24, students will make an excursion to a cell phone shop as part of the
orientation to secure an Austrian cell phone or SIM card for your unlocked phones. By both UT
and IES policy, all students must keep minutes on the phone and with you at all times.

40%                     Participation in all city tours and class discussions
         Place Notes: A Daily Fieldwork Journal: Students will be asked to keep a daily fieldwork
journal that will serve as a compendium of reflections and ideas about memories and places in
Vienna. Each day, students will describe a place they encounter—a subway station, a public
plaza, a quiet corner of a park, a noisy table at a coffee house—and the people who occupy and
make these places. Students will be encouraged to write freely, and, as the Maymester term
progresses, to begin making connections between different places they visit. The journals will
be read and evaluated at least once during the semester, and will be a central part of in-class
discussions. Be sure to bring them with you everywhere, including to class every day.
         Guided Commentary at Site of Memory: In groups of two or three, students will offer a
guided commentary of a site of memory—a building, a museum, a landscape—during our final
week in Vienna. The presentations should engage several the central themes of the course as
they introduce your classmates to a new landscape. Although a written paper is not part of this
assignment, students will need to research the history and development of the place and to
offer informed interpretations of its importance as a site of memory. The 60-minute
presentation should be divided into equal components, so that each student takes
responsibility for one-half or one-third of the presentation.
         Exam: Toward the end of the semester, students will write a two-hour examination on
the reading, lecture, and discussion of the course. The exam will consist of several short essay
questions and one longer essay.
         Class Participation and Discussion: Actively participating in this class is a central portion
of the coursework, comprising a substantial 40% of the course grade. Daily attendance for
German language classes, guest lectures, field excursions, and classroom discussions—in other
words, for all our activities—is required. Unless identified in the syllabus as “optional,” all
activities are mandatory. Any unexcused absence will lower your grade by one letter. To receive

credit for each meeting, you must take part, ask questions, make observations, and express
ideas—like in a conversation. Every student will be expected to have completed all readings and
be able to discuss them. Finally, be on time! Punctuality is essential.

                                             COURSE FORMAT
“Vienna: Memory and the City” will be conducted as a combination of lecture (from both the
course instructor and guest lecturers), field excursions, and seminar with open discussion of the
assigned readings and other course materials. As a seminar depends on informed discussions,
students will be expected to attend class each day, read all the materials before our meetings,
and come to class prepared to participate. Some classes will be held entirely at IES, while other
days will be entirely “in the field”; most will be a combination of the two. I will try to be as clear
as possible about schedule changes, but each student will be responsible for staying on top of
our itinerary and for being on time for every event.

        German Language Classes: As a fundamental component of this course, students will
receive daily instruction in the German language. These classes will be taught by native German
speakers through our host institution, IES, and will be offered at both the beginning and the
intermediate/advanced levels. Classes will begin promptly at 9 am and last for 90 minutes.
Although performance in the language classes will not be calculated into students’ final grades,
attendance is required and will be part of the participation component of the course
evaluation.

                                       READING MATERIALS
I have put together a course reading packet that includes a wide variety of reading materials,
and which you will have purchased in Austin. Some are original, primary sources, some are
scholarly texts, some are popular essays, some are study reports; some are written by
Americans, some by Austrians. In every case, I’ve tried to keep the reading to a manageable
length and I ask that you have read them closely before each class meeting.
