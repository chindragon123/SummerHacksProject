Cross-lists: AFR 372E / WGS 340                                  Computer Instruction:
Description: In this course, we will examine the novels, films, and art of women of African descent produced from
the 1980s to the present. We will focus on how African and African Diasporic women writers, filmmakers, and
artists reimagine the past, present, and future, paying particular attention to Black speculative arts as they relate
to environment, trauma, race, gender, and resistance. We will strengthen our understanding of these texts
through discussions of history, and a range of theoretical approaches, including cultural studies, feminist theory,
and gender & sexuality studies.
Texts: Toni Morrison, Beloved; Octavia Butler, Parable of the Sower; Jesmyn Ward, Sing, Unburied, Sing; Nnedi
Okorafor, Binti; Rivers Solomon, An Unkindness of Ghosts, Kasi Lemmons, Harriet (film)
Note: Additional short readings will be made available on Canvas or distributed in class.
Requirements & Grading
In order to receive a passing mark for the course, regardless of the student’s performance on other assignments or
total average of the student’s grades, all major assignments (Dialogue Essay; 3x Short Essays; Research Paper)
must be completed to the instructor’s satisfaction. Note: All papers must be formatted according to the MLA Style
Guide, available online and in-print through UT Libraries.
Final Research Paper (8-10 pages)
Through discussion with instructor, each student will develop a research topic relating to contemporary African
American women’s cultural production (literature, film, photography, television). Prior to the submission of the
final paper, students will develop an Annotated Bibliography and a Paper Draft, which they will revise based on
instructor feedback.
Dialogue Essay (5 pages)
For this essay, students will draw on both creative and critical skills to write a 4-page dialogue on the topic of
freedom, between two literary characters we have spent time with up to this point. To accompany this essay,
students will write a 1-page statement reflecting on the dialogue they’ve created.
Short Essays (3 x 2 pages)
Students will write (1) close-reading essay; (2) a “keyword” essay in which each student will propose a new
“keyword” for the study of contemporary African American women’s literature—that is, a concept or word that is
important for twenty-first-century readers to understand this literary tradition; and (3) a Buzzfeed listicle related
to course themes (e.g. “10 Songs Binti Would Listen To in Space”).
Scholarly Book Review (2-3 pages)
Guided by your own interests, you will choose a scholarly book about Black women’s fiction and write a critical
review of it.
Discussion Posts & Responses (3 of each)
Throughout the semester and at a time of the student’s choosing, everyone will compose three discussion posts of
300-500 words (which will be posted to our course Canvas site and made accessible to fellow classmates).
Additionally, students will offer concise 100-200 word responses to one classmate’s post following each discussion
post due date (for a total of 3 comments over the semester).
Attendance & Participation
Your ideas, insights, and questions are what will animate this discussion-based class. Participation grades will be
based on thoughtful and respectful contributions to class discussion; active listening to peers; coming prepared
with notes and questions, and completion of the occasional short assignment.
