You must receive a grade of a C or higher (73% or higher) in order to continue on to FR 320E or FR 324L. A grade of a
C- is not sufficient to continue on to FR 320E or to FR 324L.
Assignments and evaluation:
Regular attendance, daily preparation and persistent, active participation in class are essential to your success in learning
French. This includes being on time and prepared for class. Your instructor will also assign specific exercises to be
turned in before the start of the next class period.
You are allowed a total of 2 absences during the semester. All absences count, even if documentation is presented. A
penalty of 2% of your final course grade will be deducted for each absence after 2 in the semester (up to a 10%
maximum deduction).
You can also expect regular quizzes designed to test your preparation. If you arrive late or are not in class to take the
quiz, you will receive a zero for the quiz. There are no make-ups for missed quizzes.
Online oral assessments (video recorded and submitted via Canvas) will take place following Thèmes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Your
instructor will provide you with more details. These oral assessments very closely reflect daily in-class activities.
Examinations:
Students take 5 chapter exams in FR 317C. These will contain a variety of listening, grammar, culture, translation and
writing exercises. Please note the exam dates indicated on the syllabus, as there are no make-ups. Missing an exam
will result in a grade of zero.
                                                                                                                             2


Final Oral Examination:
For the final oral exam, which takes place at the end of the semester, you have a conversation with another student. The
culminating speaking activity counts as 10% of your final grade.
Final Exam:
There is no final exam in FR 317C.
Classroom Environment:
Students are expected to assist in maintaining a classroom environment that is conducive to learning. In order to assure
that all students have the opportunity to gain from their time spent in class, unless otherwise approved by the instructor,
students are prohibited from engaging in any form of distraction. Inappropriate behavior (use of phones, making offensive
remarks, harassment of the instructor or other students, etc.) shall result, minimally, in a request to leave class. Repeated
inappropriate or disruptive behavior will be reported to the Dean of Students.
Disabilities:
The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students
with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259 or 471-4641, or go to
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd.
Code of conduct:
The dean may initiate disciplinary proceedings under subchapter 11-300 against a student who conducts himself or
herself in a manner that impedes, interferes with, or disrupts any University teaching, research, administrative, disciplinary,
public service, learning, or other authorized activity. For more information and a complete list of Student Standards of
Conduct, please consult http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi08-09/app/gi08.appc03.html - subchapter-11-300-initiation-
of- disciplinary-proceedings.
Scholastic dishonesty:
Scholastic dishonesty on any graded assignment will result in a zero. Scholastic dishonesty includes any kind of cheating.
In language classes, this includes the use of unauthorized online translators. Be aware that scholastic dishonesty can
have far-reaching consequences, and can result in suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information,
contact the Student Judicial Services at 471- 2841, or go to http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis.php.
Religious holidays:
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy
day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to
complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence. If these procedures are followed, students will not be
penalized.
