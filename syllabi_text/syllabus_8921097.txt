         Semester: Fall 2018                                               Computer Instruction: Canvas
Prerequisites: E 603A, Rhetoric and Writing 306, 306Q, or Tutorial Course 603A
Description: As a worldwide refugee crisis continues, hateful rhetoric in the US is directed toward recent and potential immigrants,
despite immigration’s central role in the nation’s identity. Considering contemporary and historical debates about immigration
through the lens of 20th and 21st century Asian American novels and short stories, this course will focus on conceptions of
nationhood, ethnicity, race, gender, and sexuality, and ask the following questions: What has it—and does it—mean to be “Asian
American”? How does Asian American literature navigate oppression, politics, and culture? We will also be considering how Asian
American as a category has changed over time, both because of American politics but also because of historical and social changes in
Asia. As a result, our texts will deal with diasporas from China, Japan, the Koreas, Vietnam, the Philippines, India, and Pakistan.
Because this is not an exhaustive list, students will have the opportunity to explore diasporas from other Asian nations, as well.
The primary aim of this course is to help students develop and improve the critical reading and thinking skills needed for success in
upper-division courses in English and/or Asian American Studies. They will also learn historical contexts, critical debates, and the
relationship between “home” countries and the diasporas.
Cultural Diversity Flag: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity courses are designed
to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one U.S. cultural
group that has experienced persistent marginalization.
Writing Flag: This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with writing in an
academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and
receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or more
assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your
grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking,
Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
Texts:
     •   Bulosan, America is in the Heart (1946)

Requirements & Grading:
Two papers (35% each)
Weekly blog posts (30% total)
     •   Weekly blog posts, 250 words (30%): You will be asked to contribute to the course blog at least three times a week. Your
         contributions will include both an original post (at least 250 words) and a response to two different classmates’ posts (at
         least 100 words each). You will be asked to revise your classmates’ posts in your responses, commenting on both what is
         successful as an idea and what can be improved as an idiom. Topics for posts can be: issues not raised by class, alternative
         directions that a question raised in class could have gone, passages from texts (with commentary) that are intriguing but
         not raised in class, and disagreements born out of class discussion. The course blog should be seen as a way to continue the


         discussion in class, especially those ideas and issues that are left underdeveloped in classroom conversations. Blog posts
         are due Friday of each week; responses are due by the following Monday.
     •   Papers 1 and 2, 4-5 pages (70%): students can select from a few prompts that I will provide or come up with a topic of their
         own. This should be a demonstration of literary analysis that engages with one of the main themes of this course. Papers
         should be in polished collegiate prose, MLA style, double-spaced, one-inch margins, in 11 or 12 point Times or Times New
         Roman font ONLY. A rough draft will be due near the middle of the semester (worth 15% of the final grade) and will be
         subject to peer review before the final paper (worth 20% of the final grade) is submitted.
IMPORTANT: While participation is not graded, not actively participating in class will be considered an unexcused absence. Three
unexcused absences will result in a full letter grade off your final grade (so an A- would become a B-). An excused absence is either
one that is requested in advance or an emergency that can be documented/verified.
Grading Policy:
Final grades will be determined based on the following rubric. Please note: to ensure fairness, all final grades will be rounded to the
nearest whole number (so 89.5 is an A- while an 89.499 is a B+). The University of Texas does not recognize the grade of A+
A= 94-100                                         B- = 80-83                                        D+ = 67-69
A- = 90-93                                        C+ =77-79                                         D = 64-66
B+ = 87-89                                        C = 74-76                                         D- = 60-63
B = 84-86                                         C- = 70-73                                        F = 0-59
