TEACHING ASSISTANTS
Your assigned TA is who you should meet with to discuss assignments. The role of
the TA is to work with you on assignments and grade those assignments. Please, to
help establish consistent relationships, only seek guidance from your own TA
(assignments are according to your last name – see below). Office Hours are held in
your TA’s cubicle in the center of the 4th floor of BMC.

TEXTBOOK
Hair, Celsi, Ortinau & Bush (2017). Essentials of Marketing Research, Fourth Ed.
McGraw Hill. Buy at the Coop or online, bound copy, eBook or value edition –
wherever you can get it and in whatever form you desire, just be sure to get the 4th
edition only. You will need the text for weekly quizzes.
Also required – you must use the iClicker Reef app (available from App Store or
Google Play) to participate in class polls. The app uses geo-location so you cannot
participate or sign in unless you are in the lecture hall. Be sure to enable location
sharing for the app and then sign in on Canvas under assignments.

COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course builds on Adv/PR 309 (or Stats 306) to provide more explanation of
social science research methods commonly used in advertising and PR. The
understanding you gain in this course will be valuable in your future courses
(especially media, management and campaigns) and career, and for your lifetime
role as a consumer of research.
This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning
courses are designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding
the types of quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your adult and
professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to
come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
COURSE FORMAT
This is a large lecture-based class supplemented with quizzes, iClicker polls,
discussion posts, and assignments. Lectures provide the course content and
supplement the readings, quizzes ensure concepts from readings are learned
weekly, iClicker polls and discussion posts provide opportunities for in-class
engagement, assignments apply course concepts in practical ways, and exams offer
assessments of learning progress at key checkpoints.
GRADING FOR THIS COURSE WILL BE ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS:
iClicker polls 5%
Discussion Posts 5%
Assignments 40%
Weekly online quizzes 8%
Exams 40%
Professionalism and research participation 2%
IN-CLASS ICLICKER – 5%
We use iClicker Reef for polling in class. These are NOT announced ahead of time. I
will drop the two lowest scores. The purpose is to build an in-class community,
share ideas and test your burgeoning knowledge.
Discussion Posts – 5%
Periodically we will post on Canvas discussion prompts to which you must respond
within a given time-frame. These may be news articles related to Adv/PR,
professional development tips, etc. Be sure to check Canvas often so you don’t miss
them!


8/29/18 12:27 PM                                                             Kahlor 3
ASSIGNMENTS- 40%
Your TA will work with you on assignments, as well as grade all of your
assignments. Your TA will be available to answer questions about assignments
during face-to-face office hours in the Belo building and by appointment and email.
Questions about assignment grades must be raised in the week following the
posting of your grade. Always start with your TA.
Due dates are listed on the schedule below and are firm. All assignments are to be
completed individually, not as a group. You can revise one assignment (not
including “index & survey” and discussion posts) for a better grade if you improve
on the prior version in substantive ways. Work with your TA if you are interested.
Mintel/SWOT                   15%
Photo post                    1%
Photovoice                    6%
Social Mention                4%
Index post                    1%
Take survey                   1%
Quantitative analysis         12%
QUIZZES – 8%
Quizzes are administered online via Canvas. See below for dates. The quizzes
focus only on the book and each consists of 8 questions answered in 10 minutes.
Note that quizzes are due by class time on the days noted on the class schedule
below. Add the due dates to your personal calendar.
You have one week from the day a grade is posted to resolve dispute about the
grade. I will drop your lowest quiz grade – this includes missed quizzes, sick
days, emergencies or technical failures.
Complete the readings for the week, take notes and then take the quiz. You usually
have more than 72 hours to access a quiz, but once you start it, you must finish it in
10 minutes. NOTE: Sometimes Canvas crashes or freezes and I often am not
available the few hours right before class.
EXAMS – 40%
There will be three in-class multiple-choice exams and an optional final during finals
week. See Calendar for the scheduled dates.
Exams will cover materials presented in class and readings. You are responsible for
readings, even if content is not reiterated in class.


8/29/18 12:27 PM                                                                Kahlor 4
A study guide and online review session will be provided prior to each in-class
exam.
After the exams are graded and the grades are posted, you have ONE WEEK to look
over the exam questions during Prof. Kahlor's office hours. Any grade concerns
MUST be resolved then.
An optional comprehensive final examination will be offered Saturday,
December 15, 7:00 pm-10:00 pm as a make-up option for anyone who has missed
one of the in-class exams or for anyone who wants to try to improve her/his course
grade. This exam will replace the lowest regular in-class examination only if it is
higher. Otherwise, it will not be counted. This is the only make-up opportunity if any
test was missed for any reason. No other make-up exams will be given.
There is no way to know now if you will want to take the optional final, so schedule
travel at your own risk.
RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONALISM - 2%
Research Participation: As research is a big focus in this class, you are required to
take part in a total of 2 research studies that I will make available to you
throughout the semester. I do not honor research points from other departments or
schools. Do not take a study more than once (e.g., to meet another class’
requirements) or the credit will be voided. You will not receive extra credit in this
class for participating in more than 2 studies, although you may have additional
research requirements in other classes.
Professionalism: Please use a respectful tone when addressing the teaching team or
your peers. Remain attentive and engaged in lecture. Arrive at class on time, do not
pack up early, and stay for the entire class period (or until dismissed). Please refrain
from distracting behaviors like watching movies in class or surfing the web.
Students are responsible for any information missed during an absence. Lecture
notes from previous days are not available from the professor.
In class, students who use laptops are asked to sit in designated seats.
Attitude and professionalism will be considered in determining final class
professionalism grade.
FINAL GRADES
Grades this semester will NOT be rounded up or down. For example, a B- is
inclusive of all scores 80.000 through 83.999%. NOTE: You must have a minimum
grade of C in this class.


8/29/18 12:27 PM                                                               Kahlor 5
A = 94-100 A- = 90-93 B+ = 87-89 B = 84-86 B- = 80-83 C+ = 77-79 C = 74-76 C- =
70-73 D+ = 67-69 D = 64-66 D- = 60-63
Note: I do not respond the way you hope when you email me at the end of the
semester about your need for an extra .2 point to get a certain grade. Cutoffs
are listed so you can work from day 1 to ensure you are not on the edge by the end.

are the course guidelines and you must adhere to them. Students who violate
University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the

accommodations include testing time and control of distractions, please arrange to
take your exams in the SSD facility. Remind me to send the exam there before the
scheduled exam date, and have them email the exam back to me for grading.
