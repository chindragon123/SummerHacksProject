  VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (Core Component 050)
This course may be used to fulfill the visual and performing arts component of the
university core curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by
the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking
skills, teamwork, and social responsibility.
Course description:
Can we adopt the criteria used for the analysis and presentation of western art and
artists for the analysis and presentation of works by Africana women artists? How do
we define Africana women’s art and artists? Who are the most influential Africana
women artists, and in which mediums do they work? What tasks do they tackle and
what challenges face them? What are the stylistic diversities that define and
distinguish their contributions? What are the technological tools available to them,
and how have they manipulated and fashioned these tools? How have they shaped
the past and present trends in art history, and what are their aspirations and hopes
for the future? These are some of the questions that this course will investigate with
                                                                                           1


the use of art historical and critical theories that draw on oral and written
literatures, music, films, and other formal and informal documents.
