Course description and objectives:
        This course is an exploration of the relationship between primate anatomical form and
function from an evolutionary perspective. The course is designed to demonstrate how the
primate body form is adapted to its many functions, with an emphasis on adaptations to diet and
                                                                                               1


locomotion. There will be lectures as well as a separate laboratory section. The lab will not
include dissection, but will emphasize the diversity and function of the primate skeleton and give
you a chance to learn anatomy "hands-on".
After taking the course, you should:
1) have a good grasp of basic primate anatomy - e.g. be able to identify the bones that comprise
the skeleton, and to understand the arrangement of the basic muscle groups described in class;
2) understand the various methodological approaches one can use to elucidate the relationship
between morphology and function;
3) be able to provide functional explanations for some of the basic anatomical differences among
primates;
4) understand how the study of functional morphology in living primates can be applied to the
reconstruction of behavior in fossil primates.
Grading : Grades are based on the following:
        1. Midterm             20%
        2. Final               20%
        3. Lab Midterm         10%
        4. Lab Final           20%
        5. Term Paper          15% (Topic due Nov 13, Paper due Dec 10)
        6. Lab assignments 10%
        7. Participation 5% (I expect you to be able to demonstrate your understanding of the
        reading material by responding to questions I might ask in class, or simply by asking
        relevant questions yourself. Participation also consists of being “engaged” during lab, e.g.
        when working with others, contributing to group discussions , asking questions, etc).
                                                                                                  2


Final course letter grades will be assigned using the +/- grading system. Decimal places of 0.5 or
above will be rounded up. (e.g. >89.5=90=A-)
   A       A-      B+     B       B-      C+      C       C-     D+      D       D-     F

Lab grades: Each lab includes a weekly assignment to hand in. You will be graded on the
weekly lab assignments, and you will be tested on the lab material twice during the semester.
There will be a lab midterm, covering only the 3 labs on the human skeleton. At the end of the
semester, there will also be a lab final that covers the remaining lab material. Both the lab
midterm and the lab final will be in the form of a lab practical. The percentages of your final
grade for each of these components of lab are listed above.
Midterm: The midterm is 20% of your final grade and will consist of multiple choice questions
and short answers, and short or longer essays. The material you are responsible for comes from
the lectures, the readings, and the labs.
Final: The final (20% of your grade) is not cumulative and also includes material from the
lectures, the readings, and the labs. Format is similar to the midterm.
Term Paper : Each student will be required to write a term paper 10-15 pages long (double-
spaced, 12 pt font, 1 inch margins.). The paper is worth 15% of your final grade. Details about
the content of the term paper are on the Canvas website (see Term Paper link on the Home page).
Submit paper topic or outline to me by Nov 13 no later than 5 p.m. (via Canvas)
Submit paper (via Canvas) by Dec 10 at 5 pm.
In conjunction with the paper, you are required to read a tutorial on plagiarism and take a short
quiz on it. The tutorial can be found at
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/plagiarism/.
The plagiarism test is available on Canvas under “Quizzes”.
Your term paper will not be graded unless you complete the plagiarism quiz. Take the quiz
anytime but no later than Dec 10
Manage your time wisely when preparing to write the paper. This may help (even though
you’re not “dummies”!):

                                           Course policies:
The following policies are not intended to be harsh, but are included to provide clear guidelines
on issues that students often face throughout the semester.
                                                                                                  3


Expectations
I expect you to do the assigned readings in advance of the lectures and to come to class each day
on time. During class, you may use your laptop or other device for note taking but not for
checking email, doing homework from other classes, surfing the web, etc. For lab, I expect you
to come prepared with your assignment sheet in hand (from Canvas). If you forget to bring the
assignment sheet, you will have to leave class and print it out on campus, which means you will
lose precious lab time.
Attendance:
I do not take formal attendance, but I am aware of who consistently comes to class and who
doesn’t. Consistent attendance can help boost your grade if you end up with a borderline final
grade. Whether you come to class or not, you are responsible for keeping up with what happens
in class. This applies to the content of the class, handouts, and announcements about class
policies, events, deadlines, etc. Lectures and announcements can be found on Canvas, but it is
easy to miss other pertinent information if you are absent from class.
Guns.
As of August 1, 2016, due to the passage of S.B. 11 (https://campuscarry.utexas.edu), licensed,
concealed handguns are now allowed in most campus buildings, including classrooms. If you
hold a license to carry a concealed weapon, it is your responsibility to know and follow the
Texas and University policies listed here: https://campuscarry.utexas.edu/students. Visible
weapons or threatening behavior will be reported to the UT Police Department immediately.
The following statement serves as a reminder - I am required to notify you of this verbally, and I
will do so in class:
Based on my legal right to ban guns from my UT office, no guns are allowed in my office (SAC
5.128). Leaving a gun unattended (as it would be, if left outside my office) is against the law.
Please plan accordingly. YOU are always welcome in my office, just not your gun. Thank you.
Make-ups
There will be no make-up exams or labs. Exceptions will be made only 1) with proof of dire
emergency or illness, 2) due to observance of a religious holy day, or 3) due to military service. I
will not provide alternative exam times for students who have personal travel plans or
commitments, so please don’t ask.
       Illness or emergency: If you miss an exam or lab due to illness or emergency, contact me
        as soon as possible either before the exam or within 2 days after the exam or lab. You
        will not be given a make-up unless you can provide documentation regarding the reason
        for your absence.
       Religious holy days. By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence
        at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must
        miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a
        religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within
        a reasonable time after the absence.
                                                                                                   4


       Absence for military service. In accordance with section 51.9111 of the Texas Education
        Code, a student is excused from attending classes or engaging in other required activities,
        including exams, if he or she is called to active military service of a reasonably brief
        duration. [The maximum time for which the student may be excused has been defined by
        the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board as "no more than 25 percent of the total
        number of class meetings or the contact hour equivalent (not including the final
        examination period) for the specific course or courses in which the student is currently
        enrolled at the beginning of the period of active military service.”] The student will be
        allowed a reasonable time after the absence to complete assignments and take exams.
Students with disabilities: Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
Students with Disabilities at ssd@austin.utexas.edu , 471-6259 (voice), 410-6644 (video phone)
or http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/. Please inform me as soon as possible if you need
accommodations.
Late assignments
Late assignments will cost you 10 points (out of 100) per day. This could change your grade
dramatically. Don't be late!
Grades
The grade you are given, either on an individual exam or assignment or as your final grade, is not
the starting point of a negotiation. It is your grade unless an error has been made. If you think an
error has been made, let me know within one week of receiving the assignment or exam grade.
Extra Credit:
I do not offer “extra credit” opportunities. If you are struggling in the course, please come for
help during the semester when there is still time for me to help you. Take advantage of office
hours or make an appointment with me or the TA . Do not wait until the course is over and ask
me to change your grade because you are trying to graduate, or you have had a tough time with
your personal life this semester. By then, it is too late for me to help you.
Honor Code: Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor
Code.:
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.
Scholastic Dishonesty
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from The
University. Scholastic dishonesty" includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion,
                                                                                                    5


falsifying academic records, misrepresenting facts, and any act designed to give unfair academic
advantage to the student (such as, but not limited to, submission of essentially the same written
assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor), or the attempt to
commit such an act.
See http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis.php

http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/plagiarism/
Special note on use of social media: If students create a Facebook page (or use other social
media) to communicate about the course, Dr. Shapiro and the teaching assistant must be
provided access. Communication about content/answers to lab assignments, or course exams
(whether verbally or via electronic communications) will be considered cheating and students
involved will be subject to disciplinary action.
