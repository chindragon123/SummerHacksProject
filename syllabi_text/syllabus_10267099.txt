             B+ = 87-89                        C- = 70-73                       D- = 60-63
             B = 84-86                                                          F = 0-59
             B- = 80-83
                                                                                                       2


Classroom Policy
Devices
      ● Must be kept in silent mode unless an emergency notification is expected.
      ● Can be used for research and class note taking, but not for social media (unless related to class
          activities)
Food/Drink
      ● Food is not allowed in class.
      ● Drinks in closed containers are permitted but must be kept on the floor or out of sight
          when not in use.
Required Equipment
      ●   Bring Internet-connecting devices for research and collaboration.
      ●   Have a shareable cloud space for collaboration with fellow students.
UT Electronic Mail Notification Policy
Electronic mail (e-mail) is a mechanism for official University and instructor communication to students.
Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with
University- and course-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be
time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week.
It is the responsibility of every student to keep the University and instructor informed of changes in
his or her official e-mail address (do so at
https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/bio/address_change.WBX).
Consequently, e-mail returned to the University with "User Unknown" is not an acceptable excuse
for missed communication. Similarly, undeliverable messages returned because of a full inbox or
use of a spam filter will be considered delivered without further action required of the University
or instructor. (see
http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy​)
Use of Class Materials
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, and homework
assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the class materials is a
violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.
Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may
be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could
result in further disciplinary action. This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to
websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students. (from
https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/coursematerials/Sample+Use+Statement+for+Syllabus)
                                                                                                          3


Attendance/Absences
Attendance is tied directly to your grade. If attending a scheduled class meeting is not possible,
students are expected to promptly notify the instructor of extenuating circumstances
(hospitalization, death in the family, etc.). In addition, see the exception below for religious holy
days.
Arriving more than ten minutes late at the beginning of class or after a break, leaving class without
permission, and leaving class prior to dismissal for the day all count as being tardy. Points will be
deducted from your grade for each of these occurrences.
Religious Holidays
Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code states that a student shall be excused from attending
classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day,
including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be
penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from
which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence.
University policy requires students to notify each of their instructors at least fourteen days prior to the
date they will be absent from scheduled classes to observe a religious holy day.
(from ​http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/1555_001.pdf​)
Q Drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to
six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:“Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of
higher education may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped
courses, including any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher
education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
Classroom Etiquette
Please observe the following rules during class as a courtesy to fellow students and the instructor.
     ● Be on time at the beginning of class.
     ● You may only use your phone during class to interact with Canvas, research design
          resources, and collaborate.
     ● Don’t distract other students.
Academic Integrity
The University's ​Honor Code ​states that “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall
abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” You are expected to
maintain absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in scholastic your academic
discipline; and avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another
student (adapted from ​http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php)​.
                                                                                                            4


Academic Dishonesty
In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines academic
dishonesty as including any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved academic advantage, such
as:
    ● Cheating
    ● Plagiarism
    ● Unauthorized Collaboration / Collusion
    ● Falsifying Academic Records
    ● Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain an
          extended deadline for an assignment)
    ● M​ultiple submissions​ (submitting essentially the same written assignment for two courses
          without authorization to do so)
    ● Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity
          (adapted from​ http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php​)
          Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to
          disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal
          from the University.​ (from​ http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_faculty_syllabus.php)
Plagiarism
“Plagiarism” includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or
obtaining by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source, including
words, ideas, illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting
that material as one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program
course requirement (from Sec. 11-402,
http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-con​ duct/​).
Copyright and Fair Use
Understanding the basic principles of copyright and fair use is of critical importance to designers.
Many of the uses we will make of texts, images, and videos this semester will be covered by the
doctrine of fair use. However, as creators, you need to be aware of your own and other copyright
holders’ legal rights, and to properly identify and license your own and others’ works. We will
discuss these issues during the semester as needed, but when you have questions about whether
or when you can appropriate someone else’s work, a useful resource is Georgi K. Harper’s
Copyright Crash Course, available at ​http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/.
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD)
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for Students with
Disabilities (512-471-6259, ​ssd@austin.utexas.edu​, ​http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/, ​or
videophone 512-471-6644). Please provide documentation of your needs during the first week of
class, if possible, so that I can make the necessary accommodations promptly.
                                                                                                         5


Student Support Services
There are numerous free and/or low-cost support services available to students at UT. They
include (but are not limited to) the following:
Fine Arts Career Service​s (512-232-7333, utexas.edu/finearts/careers) provides a full range of
services and resources to support students and alumni.
The Undergraduate Writing Center
(512-471-6222, uwc.utexas.edu) helps students with every phase of writing assignments for courses.
University Health Services ​(512-471-4955, healthyhorns.utexas.edu) provides medical and health
promotion services for currently enrolled students and some non-students who are
officially enrolled in certain University programs.
The Counseling and Mental Health Center ​(512-471-3515, cmhc.utexas.edu) helps students with their
personal concerns so that they can meet the daily challenges of student life.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns
Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is
provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and
Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas
Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit ​http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Personal Nouns
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics
dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance,
and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will gladly
honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster,
and by the gender pronouns you use she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of this preference early in
the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual harassment,
sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational
institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
     1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
     2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
          become involved in a Title IX investigation.
     3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory
Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX
                                                                                                             6


Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are
disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff
member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you
want to speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university,
email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources, visit
titleix.utexas.edu​ or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
Emergency Procedures
Mass e-mails (in addition to sirens and fire alarms, when appropriate) will be used to provide
students, faculty, and staff with information regarding potential threats to the safety and security of
the campus community. E-mails will also be used as a way to notify students, faculty, and staff of
emergency situations and keep them updated on the situation. Emergency officials also have the
ability to disseminate important information via text message directly to the cell phones of users
subscribed to the service. Please consider subscribing to this service at
https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/csas/text/main/​.

                                                    A ​Wireframe​ Focuses More On Functionality Than
                                                    Aesthetics. Wireframes are not concerned with how the
                                                    product looks, but how it functions. While a high-fidelity

                                                    elements, a ​wireframe​ is specifically concerned with
