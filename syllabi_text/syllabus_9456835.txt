PREAMBLE
Welcome.
This is a big deal. It’s the capstone class. The place where you get to show off everything you’ve
learned so far, learn a few new tricks, and put your education to the test with real world
applications.
This course is designed to be a rigorous process that transitions you from academic to
professional life. Additionally, it will familiarize you with the process of formulating integrated
communications campaigns, from identifying the problem and developing the strategy to
producing and distributing the creative content through social and earned media – in real time.
The goal of this course is to mirror what's happening out there in both popular culture and the
advertising industry. Effective communications are no longer created in silos. Collaboration
amongst all disciplines rules the day. Big agencies with even bigger budgets are no longer
required to produce big, world-changing ideas. Only creative problem solving, resourcefulness,
and resolve are needed.
It will not be easy. You’ll spend a lot of time researching, studying, ideating, writing,
experimenting, producing, directing, managing, promoting, and presenting. And you’ll spend time
working together in agency-like teams with people you might not get along with on tasks you
might not like or feel comfortable doing. Otherwise known as personal growth.
When the dust clears, you’ll walk away with more than something you’ll be proud of and
something tangible that will get you one step closer to landing your dream job.


HOW
This is the real world, packaged into a class. As such, it is designed to be flexible and ready for
change at a moment’s notice. We’ll have meetings as a full class, and we’ll have private team
check-ins online and in my office. Additionally, you’ll be working with your teams, both in and out
of class, for several hours a week.
We will have guests lecturers and/or meet off campus with working professionals. We will have to
accommodate their busy schedule. So our meetings with them may occur at times outside of
class. Every effort will be made to notify you of these meetings ahead of time. But, as is common
in our industry, things change. Be prepared.
Sure, I’ll lecture some, and I’ll serve as a moderator and facilitator. But I prefer classes to be
intelligent discussions between smart professionals. So let’s make it a conversation with many
sides. Speak up. Your opinion is welcome, valid, and always interesting. And it’s the vocal ones
with smart perspectives that do well in this business.
The class will be intensive and demanding. That’s life in this business. Canvas will be our support
system. It will host links, readings, and other course materials. It is your responsibility to ensure
that the email address listed on Canvas is correct, as it is at this address that you will receive all
pertinent class announcements and directives over the course of the semester.
While some of your assignments will be done individually, your major assignments will be done
as a member of a team. Once you have been assigned to a team, you must stay in that team for
the duration of the semester. There will be no switching at any time. You will be assigned to a
team to ensure that we have a number of well-rounded and balanced teams.


MUSTS
You will be responsible for a wide range of assignments and experiences throughout the
semester. Initial due dates are listed in the schedule at the end of this syllabus. More assignment
details will be distributed at the appropriate time. But as a preview, you’ll be responsible for the
following:
1 VIDEO CO NTENT
While you may create other media to support your campaign, video is the heart of this class. And
it’s a long process. Each team will be expected produce and post online. The video(s) you create
is essentially the product you are selling to consumers. Without a well-crafted product to distribute
and promote, it will not succeed. It is a team effort and requires everyone to help out in a variety
of rolls that haven’t done before.
2 FINAL PRESENTATIO N + CASE STUDY
You will have mini-presentations along the way, but the final presentation and digital case study
of the campaign you hand in will be a large chunk of your grade. You won’t be presenting to a
client what you think they should do, but to industry experts what you’ve done and why it was or
was not a success.
3 MINI-ASSIG NM ENTS
The process for creating integrated video campaigns has been broken up over 15 weeks. You
may be presenting or handing in materials at the beginning or end of each stage individually or as
a group. There will be reading assignments and online tutorials via sites like Lynda.com, Udemy,
YouTube, Vimeo, No Film School, etc. You will be asked to write and/or present your findings.
While there is no required textbook in this class, be prepared to spend $50-$100 each.
4 PARTICIPATIO N
Advertising is a team sport and a team is only as strong as it’s weakest link. I will not be taking
roll call, but class attendance and participation on the days we meet as a class are critical and
mandatory, as is lively discussion. How you perform with your teammates will significantly weight
your grade in this course. Peer evaluations will be given at the end of the semester and will be
15% of your grade. This grade cannot be changed. If you are fired from your team, you will fail
this course.


GRADES
Client Presentations               35%
Pitch Decks/Video                  30%
Mini-Assignments                   20%
Participation / Peer Evaluation    15%
Note that there is a catalog requirement for all Advertising and PR majors to have a minimum
grade of C in all communication courses and all courses required and electives for their major.
Final letter grades are calculated as follows:
A 93.5 to 100 A- 89.5 to 93.4 B+ 86.5 to 89.5 B 83.5 to 86.4 B- 79.5 to 83.4 C+ 76.5 to 79.4 C
73.5 to 76.4 C- 69.5 to 73.4 D+ 66.5 to 69.4 D 63.5 to 66.4 D- 59.5 to 63.4 F 0 to 59.4
Questions about grades must be submitted in writing via email within 5 days of when the grade is
posted.
The digital time stamp when you post work on Canvas will be considered the time you handed it
in. That item must be complete. Errors in uploading, corrupted files, or missing emails are not
excused. Technology can be challenging, so plan ahead. Assignments turned in late will receive
a zero. The work cannot be made up. I expect your work to be of the highest professional grade.
This includes your writing style, your presentation skills, and your ability to put a beautiful
campaign case study together.
Please treat this class as an internship, and one of the last stops to polish your skills on your way
to a fine career. And please familiarize yourself with the university policy regarding academic
dishonesty. I take this policy very seriously.


RESOURCES
There are no required textbooks in this class, but you can expect to spend roughly $50-$100 on
various resources, if you can’t get them for free. This is by no means an exhaustive list and will
grow over the course of the semester.

INFO
Student Responsibilities:
1. Students are responsible for all material covered in class and all assigned readings and
viewings.
2. Students must complete readings and assignments by the times specified.
3. Check Canvas frequently, and make sure your e-mail address is current with the University so
that you can receive emails sent through Canvas. It is the student’s responsibility to maintain this
email address and ensure that it is correct and able to receive messages. Check your junk mail
too.
4. Any questions about grades must be submitted in writing within 5 days of when the grade is

5. This course upholds the values of the University Policy of Scholastic Dishonesty. Students who
violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. For more information,
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis_whatis.php .
6. Technology can be a pain. So plan ahead. Do not wait until the last minute, or even hour. Work
posted or handed in late is late, regardless of technology errors, computer crashes, corrupt files,
or lack of internet access. I honor the Canvas or email timestamps, depending on the specified
submission format. Forgetting to attach files, or email bounce-backs, are not excuses.
W riting
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly
during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your
instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or
more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag
classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication,
Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating
Board.
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,

Scholastic Dishonesty Statem ent
The Department of Advertising has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in
detail in the Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty for the College of Communication. By
enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all of the student responsibilities described in


that document. If the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is
unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification. Policy on Scholastic
Dishonesty: Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to
disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course an/or dismissal from the
University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University,
policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
