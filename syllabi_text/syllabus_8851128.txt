Course             The course examines issues in financial reporting from both preparer and user perspectives. The basic
Objectives         objectives of the course are:
(1) to learn about current GAAP.
(2) to consider the economics of transactions and events, and understand whether and how financial reporting captures those
    economics. This way of thinking lays the foundation for understanding how equity and credit analysts use financial reports.
    This way of thinking also allows you to learn about business (i.e., broadens your thinking beyond just debits and credits).
(3) to learn how to reason about financial reporting problems in a forward direction, similar to what preparers normally do (i.e.,
    work forward from the data to journal entry to financial statement) and to learn how to reason about financial reporting
    problems in a backward direction, similar to what financial report users do (i.e., work backward from financial statements and
    notes to the financial statements to journal entry).

COURSE MATERIALS
TEXT: INTERMEDIATE ACCOUNTING, by Kieso, Weygandt, and Warfield, 2016, 16th edition. Available for purchase at Co-
Op in hardbound (new or used) or loose-leaf form. Many cheaper options exist: Available for hard copy rental on Amazon.com or
(perhaps) Chegg.com. Available for e-purchase or e-rental in several places, including Kindle.
Unless you buy a new book at the Co-Op, you are not likely to have access to the Chapter 21 Update-Accounting for Leases. This
updated chapter just came out this year. So, if you do not have access, please let me know and I can get you the updated chapter
when we get closer to the time we cover that chapter.
ADVANCED ACCOUNTING, by Halsey and Hopkins (3rd edition). Purchase three chapters from this book via custom publishing.
Custom published book will be available at Co-Op. Alternatively, this can be purchased as a custom E-book at this URL:
https://mybusinesscourse.com/book/financialreportingaustin#purchase
CLASS NOTES: These are essential, cannot-do-without class notes. I will provide the relevant parts on
Canvas in advance of class. It is up to you to have them available at class each day. These notes contain (1) my class notes,
and (2) the "Additional Problems in Class Notes" indicated on the assignment sheet later in this syllabus.
The class notes will be your primary source of studying the topics covered in this course.
SOLUTIONS TO ADDITONAL PROBLEMS: This packet contains the solutions to the
optional unassigned additional homework problems. It does not include those to be turned in for course credit. These assigned
problems will be posted to Canvas after they are due.
Available for purchase at Jenn’s Copy & Binding, 2518 Guadalupe Street. (Guadalupe at Dean Keeton). (2200@jennscopies.com).
Be sure to get the solutions to additional problems for this class and not my ACC 380K.1 class.
The three primary sources of studying topics in this course are: class notes, solutions to homework problems (both assigned and
unassigned - see above), and the textbook. Based on feedback from students who have taken this course previously, your primary
source of studying topics in this course probably will be the class notes. Students have indicated to me that they rely heavily on the
class notes and homework problems to study for exams. Spending time reading every word in the textbook was not deemed as
productive for several reasons:
         (1) we cover topics very quickly in this class and there is not much time to spend reading the textbook,
         (2) the textbook contains many accounting details that are not that important (i.e., they will never show up on exams),
         (3) the textbook forces students to think only about current accounting; many aspects of this course involve thinking about
         alternative perspectives, some of which are not currently allowed (but may be something you would want to do as part of
         your financial statement analysis, and
         (4) some topics are not discussed in the book.
Thus, you are encouraged to use the textbook as a reference tool; read excerpts from the textbook as necessary. For most,
reading the textbook on an as needed basis after we talk about a topic in class will work best. For others, reading it before class
optimizes their performance in this class. For topics you’ve never been exposed to before (such as derivatives), reading the notes
and related sections in the textbook before class can prove very valuable. Reading the textbook on an as-needed basis can save
you valuable time and maximize efficiency. DO WHAT WORKS BEST FOR YOU.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS
    EXAMS: There will be two mid-term exams and one final exam.                 Each exam will only cover the materials in that portion
    of the course, with the following important exception: statement of cash flows and deferred taxes topics will be covered in all
    three exams.
    My exams are largely problem based. For each of the three exams, you can bring an 8 ½ by 11 “cheat sheet.” Writing/typing on
    both sides is acceptable.
    HOMEWORK: There will be 14 homework assignments.                      These homework assignments help you stay up to date on
    the material (it’s easy to let things slide and somewhat disastrous in this class if you do). Solutions to these assigned homework
    problems will be made available on the due date after class on the Canvas course website. You will be able to drop one
    homework from your grade, but I suggest that you make every effort to do them all.
    Homework should be turned in electronically on Canvas with a deadline of immediately after class on the day homework is due.
    Graded homework will be returned electronically on Canvas.
    .
COURSE GRADES
    Course grades are determined by the following weighting scheme:
      Exam 1                           290 points     29%
      Exam 2                           290 points     29%
      Final Exam                       290 points     29%
      Homework                         130 points     13%
      TOTAL POINTS                   1,000 points    100%
DETAILS ON GRADING
EXAMS: Exams are problem based and so we do assign partial credits. For example, to the extent we can tell that you made a
pure math mistake (i.e., you wrote $10 x 5000 units = $5,000), not all points are deducted. Hence, showing your work is important!
I grade on a curve with an average grade generally designed to fall within a 3.2 – 3.4 guideline range. Class participation will be
considered where there is a borderline grade.
No make-up exams will be given. Medical emergencies and family emergencies are the only valid reasons that will be accepted for
missing an exam. You must provide supporting documentation (e.g., signed note from a physician) if you do miss an exam. If you
are excused from an exam, the other two exams will be re-weighted (e.g., if you miss the first exam, the second and final exams will
be re-weighted). If you miss two exams, you automatically fail this course and no re-weighting will be granted. If you do not have a
valid reason for missing an exam, you will receive a zero on the exam, which usually implies failing the course.


SYLLABUS ACC 326 Professor Moore – Fall 2018                                                                       Page 4 of 13
HOMEWORK: Unless otherwise noted, the homework will be graded on an effort, and not accuracy, basis.                   Each homework
is worth 10 points. You will receive full credit for a problem if the grader concludes that you made a reasonable effort; you will
receive a zero if you did not turn in the homework (or turned it in late). Scores of less than 10 will be assigned based on partial
completion of homework.
REGRADING POLICY: My TAs and I will make every effort to ensure the accuracy of grading. Should grading
discrepancies arise (e.g., not adding up your points correctly, etc.), you must submit a TYPED-UP, WRITTEN request for re-
grading, on one page, and turn in your written request along with your exam within 3 calendar days (72 hours) after the exams
are given back to you.
STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
I. GETTING OFF TO A SOLID START:
    I would highly recommend that those of you who feel in any way nervous about your skills at making journal entries to read
    through Chapter 3 of the textbook and work some problems. Work through as many as you need to feel comfortable with
    making journal entries. Suggested: E3-1, E3-8, E3-20 (don’t do Part B), P3-1, P3-5, P3-6, P3-8, P3-9, P3-11, and P3-12. I can
    provide you with the solutions to these problems.
II. CLASS ATTENDANCE AND HOMEWORK:
    In my opinion, class attendance and homework are the two most important components of this course. Why?
    Reason #1: There is a lot of material in ACC 326 and the course moves quickly. If you miss class, you will typically spend at
    least triple the class time to learn the materials on your own. Trying to figure out on your own some of the course material
    is just too tough. Maximizing in-class learning is the most efficient way to learn the materials.
    Reason #2: Much of what I cover in class will be included in the exams.
    If, for some reason, you have to miss class, I recommend that you obtain the class notes from someone else and, if possible,
    also have them audio record the class. It’s an easy way to ensure that you can get up to speed on the material you missed.
    Reason #3: Since the content of ACC 326 is largely problem oriented, doing the homework problems on a timely basis is a
    must for good performance. Exam performance is directly related to systematic preparation, which includes timely completion
    of the homework assignments.
    There are homework problems from the textbook and in my class notes. What is the difference? Problems in the class notes
    supplement the textbook when the textbook is deficient in a particular type of problem. So you should view the two as
    complements and not substitutes. If you don’t do all of the problems for a particular topic, be sure to scan all problems and
    make sure you get coverage on all types of problems/subtopics within a particular topic.
III. USE THE RESOURCES PROVIDED:
CANVAS: The course Canvas site will be an integral part of my teaching tool and your learning tool.
        Solutions to homework that is turned in for credit will be available on Canvas.
        Discussion boards are available on Canvas. The TA’s and I will monitor these discussion groups to provide timely answers
        to questions.

Privacy in Canvas: Information in Canvas is protected by your UTEID login. Other students will not actually learn your email
address and no other personal data will be revealed through Canvas. If you have any concerns, please contact the ITS Help Desk
at 475-9400 for help removing your name from view of other students.
     TAs:          The TAs have earned their positions and are eager to help you.
IV. THINKING LIKE A BUSINESS PERSON:
   Your in-class understanding of the accounting issues will be much enhanced if you train yourself at the same time to think like a
   business person. In a lot of topics we cover, a solid understanding of the underlying business transactions is a must before you
   tackle the accounting issues. Understanding the business transactions and the business environment are also important for
   fulfilling our class objectives, i.e., understanding the economics of the transactions and reasoning backward from the financial
   statements to infer firms’ performance.
   Where do you start? One great starting point is to acquire knowledge about what is going on in the business world. Thus, I
   encourage you to get access to a business publication and to read it on a regular basis. I realize that time is a scarce commodity
   but even a little bit of reading here and there is much better than no reading. I recommend:
            1.   The Wall Street Journal. It’s THE newspaper of business.
            2.   Financial Times. It’s equivalent to the international version of Wall Street Journal.
            3.   Fortune. It comes out every couple of weeks and has longer and more in-depth articles.
            4.   Forbes.
            5.   The Economist.
            6.   Business Week.
            7.   Barron’s
   I can provide you with links to websites which will allow you to obtain a discount on these publications (except for Forbes).
OTHER
     Academic accommodation for students with disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
     academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
     Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY, or http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd. If you are eligible for an academic
     accommodation for a test, please provide me email notification at least 10 days prior to the test, so that I can obtain
     appropriate reservations for the accommodation.
     Religious holy Days: Per university policy, you must notify me of an absence related to a religious holy day observance no later
     than 14 days prior to the observance of that holy day. If your religious holy day falls on one of the exam dates, I will reschedule
     you to take a ‘make-up’ exam before the class exam date.
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
The Department of Accounting is making a concerted effort to focus students’ attention on their professional conduct. Why? We are
the #1 program in the country, but this ranking can easily be undermined by a lack of professional conduct.


SYLLABUS ACC 326 Professor Moore – Fall 2018                                                                     Page 6 of 13
Developing and protecting the value of a McCombs degree influences everything I do and should influence your behavior as well.
The McCombs brand will open doors for you, but it does not provide you with entitlements. You will still have to earn the benefits of
being branded as from McCombs. This of course will also ensure that your degree reflects well on you and your fellow graduates
throughout your careers.
      What does it mean to be professional? Behaving with the highest level of integrity, respect for others, and ethics. Stand
      by your word, make good decisions, and take responsibility for your actions. Show courtesy and respect for the views and times
      of your fellow students and to faculty, TA’s, program directors, and staff. In turn, we will show you the same.
For this class
Professional behavior is not only required when interacting with someone outside of the university environment, but it also is
expected in your classes and in situations related to this class. Therefore:
1. I expect you to attend class. In the professional working world, attendance is mandatory unless illness or an emergency
prohibits it. Performance is positively correlated with attendance.
2. I expect students to arrive to class on time. It is very disruptive to the class when a student enters the classroom after class
has begun, as it interrupts the flow of the lecture/discussion and distracts the other students.
3. I expect that all electronic devices will be turned off once class begins. Cell phones, pagers, Blackberries, and other
communication devices are to be turned completely off (including turning off “cell phone vibrate mode” during class time.) Laptops
should also be turned completely off unless they are being used to take notes. Please note that my academic colleagues report that
research shows that retention is better with handwritten notes. I also expect that reading of non-class materials will stop once class
starts.
4. I expect students to not take personal breaks during class. There may be cases where a student must leave class for one
important reason or another, but students leaving and returning during class is very disruptive, so please keep these disturbances to
an absolute minimum.
5. I expect that you will not have conversations or write notes back and forth with other students during class.
6. I expect that you will be respectful of me, the TA, and of the other students in class and in office hours.
7. I expect you to be responsible for getting the course notes and in-class handouts on any day that you must miss class. It is
not my responsibility to secure missed material for you.
In return, you can expect me and the TA to:
1. Be in class and office hours on time.
2. Be respectful of your need to learn the material in this class. Thus, we will provide timely and enthusiastic responses to
questions made in person or on Canvas and keep you up to date on changes in the syllabus or homework solutions, again on a
timely basis. You can expect us to return homework and exams in a timely fashion to enhance your learning experience.
3. Be courteous to you in our interactions with you in and outside of class.
4. Provide you with an education that will prepare you well for the long-term.

                                       Departmental Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both students
and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the department’s Policy Statement on
Scholastic Dishonesty. By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all of the faculty responsibilities described in
that document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all of the student responsibilities described in that
document. If the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your
responsibility to ask me for clarification.
                       Application of Departmental Policy to Writing Assignments in this Course
GRADED HOMEWORK
Working on the homework assignments with other students who are currently enrolled in ACC 326 is permitted.
However, merely copying the work of another student who has previously completed the homework assignment is not
permitted. Copying homework solutions from the solutions manual, another instructors’ solution packet, a previous
semesters’ solution packet, or any other source also is not permitted. Violation of this policy will be treated as an act of
“scholastic dishonesty.” Evidence of violation of this policy will be forwarded to the Dean of Students with a
recommendation of up to and including that a grade of “F” be assigned in the course.
EXAMS
Each student is expected to independently complete the exams during the designated exam period. Each student
should not refer to other students’ exam solutions or discuss the exam with other students during the exam period.
Violation of this policy will be treated as an act of “scholastic dishonesty.” Evidence of non-independent work will be
forwarded to the Dean of Students with a recommendation of up to and including that a grade of “F” be assigned in the
course.

        BIFURCATION OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT WORKS. THE TEXT TALKS ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF IFRS WHERE CONVERTIBLE
        DEBT IS ALWAYS BIFURCATED. BUT THE GENERAL DISCUSSION WILL BE HELPFUL FOR OUR DISCUSSION OF US GAAP IN
        THOSE CASES WHERE IT IS BIFURCATED. SO WHY DOESN’T THE TEXT JUST TALK ABOUT THIS BIFURCATION CONCEPT IN
        THE CASE OF US GAAP? THE TEXTBOOK IS NOT QUITE RIGHT WHEN IT SAYS US GAAP DOES NOT BIFURCATE
        CONVERTIBLE DEBT– UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES (CASH SETTLEMENT OPTION), IT IS BIFURCATED.
