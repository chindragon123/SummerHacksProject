Course Description:
This course provides a rigorous introduction to the anthropology of the state. Focusing primarily on key
theoretical interventions within anthropology and cognate disciplines, the course introduces a set of
different ways to understand the exercise and accomplishment of rule. Course readings are oriented
around a series of key questions and debates in both historical and contemporary discussion of state
power. Namely, the course asks:
• What is the state?
• What does it mean to examine “state formation” historically and ethnographically?
• What different forms (states?) might a state take?
• What is state power and how does it work?
• How might one understand and trace everyday experiences of and encounters with the state?
• What is the relationship between sovereignty, violence, and legitimacy?
• What is territory and how is it lived?
The course explores different ways that these questions have been engaged in Marxian thought, post-
structural critique, and other schools of critical social theory. Though course readings are primarily
theoretical in content, the course is targeted broadly at students interested in carrying out ethnographic
and/or historical qualitative research on questions related to politics, power, and rule.
                                                                                                              1


                                                   Course Goals
This course is designed as an introduction to the political anthropology of the state, but focuses
specifically on three terms that have (again) come to dominate discussions of power in the contemporary
moment: state, sovereignty, and territory. The relationship between and, indeed, the very meanings of
these terms are hotly contested and by no means clear. Yet, they remain concepts that any student of
power, politics, violence, development, environment and more must grapple with. The course, as such,
aims to provide a solid foundation of understanding for students interested in pursuing ethnographic,
historical, and qualitative research on politics and power in its many forms. Though by no means
comprehensive, it should provide the tools for students to actively explore and engage a rich literature,
set of methodological tools, and emerging areas of investigation. For the most part, it privileges
theoretical readings over book length ethnographic and historical studies (with some exceptions).
However, I have endeavored to provide a robust set of suggestions in each week for those wishing to dig
further into any given topic. On completing this course, students should be prepared to:
•    Explain (in both oral and written work) core theories and ideas about the anthropology of state,
     sovereignty, and territory.
•    Understand different theoretical approaches to understanding state power (Marxian, Foucauldian,
     Feminist, etc.)
•    Engage a series of key concepts and terms in discussions of state, sovereignty, and territory
     (hegemony, governmentality, exception, space, etc.)
•    Articulate ways that theories of state, sovereignty, and territory might inform their own research
     designs, interpretations, and analyses.
                               Course Format, Expectations, and Procedures:
•    This is a seminar course. The bulk of the class will be devoted to class discussion, not lectures. I
     expect everyone to be an active, regular, and respectful participant of course discussion.
•    This is a reading intensive course. I expect students to arrive in class having done the readings and
     prepared to engage in active class discussion.
•    I reserve the right to treat this syllabus as provisional. That is: if I or course participants identify other
     readings that will be helpful, I reserve the right to swap them in for readings listed here as needed.
     The amount of reading listed in this syllabus will remain approximately the same.
•    I ask that everyone write 8 reading responses over the course of the semester. More on how to do
     these will be provided in class. These response papers should be posted on the canvas Midnight on
     Tuesdays before class.
•    Everyone will have an opportunity to lead class discussion twice. We will discuss the format for this in
     class.
•    Your final project should be productive for you. While this project should draw on themes and
     readings from the course, the format is open ended. It should be the equivalent of an approximately
     20-page paper.
•    Each class has, in addition to required readings, suggested readings and/or framing pieces. The
     suggested readings are just that: suggested materials that you are more than welcome to pursue for
     further grounding in a given week’s materials.
                                                Required Material
All course materials with the exception of books are available on the course’s Canvas site. This includes
suggested readings (again, with the exception of books). The following books are required reading for the
course and may be purchased at the campus store or from other venues.

                                             University Policies
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date
of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a
project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed
work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed
six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
Student Accommodations
Students with a documented disability may request appropriate academic accommodations from the
Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-
6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
• Please request a meeting as soon as possible to discuss any accommodations
• Please notify me as soon as possible if the material being presented in class is not accessible
• Please notify me if any of the physical space is difficult for you
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
      “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the
      University and uphold academic integrity.”
This means that work you produce on assignments, tests and exams is all your own work, unless it is
assigned as group work. I will make it clear for each test, exam or assignment whether collaboration is
encouraged or not.
Always cite your sources. If you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in
previous class), you must make that clear otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to
academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course.
You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty Policy which can be found at the
following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
