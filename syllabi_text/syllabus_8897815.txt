COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of how the basic
principles of ecology (the study of how organisms interact with their
environment) can help us understand variation in primate biology and
behavior. Using a comparative and evolutionary approach, we will first
identify variation in ecological traits across primate species. Then we will
explore and how this variation can influence primate sociality, life history,
reproductive strategies, sensory systems, animal communities, and
cognition. Because most primate species are threatened, endangered, or
even facing extinction, we will also explore how aspects of ecology are used
in primate conservation.
Objectives: After taking this course you should be able to:
  1) Understand what it means to take an evolutionary approach to thinking about primate biology and behavior.
  2) Describe the variation in primate ecological traits (e.g., diet, habitat).
  3) Be able to critically read and discuss scientific papers.
   4) Be able to articulate evolutionary hypotheses for a given pattern of primate behavior or biology and to design
       and critique tests of those hypotheses using logic and evidence.
COURSE FORMAT AND REQUIREMENTS
This course meets twice a week (Mon & Wed) and will be structured around interactive lectures and dedicated
discussion days or partial days where you will be expected to come prepared to discuss the assigned readings.
There will also be several in-class group activities, some of which will result in assignments to be submitted the
next week. Thus, participation is an important part of your grade. It is difficult to participate if you are not present
in class and so attendance is highly recommended and will be recorded.
Prerequisites: ANT301 (or permission of instructor)
Readings: There is no assigned textbook. All readings will be posted in Canvas or through library e-journals. Make
sure to check Canvas regularly. You will be expected to print a scientific poster at PCL at the end of the semester
($20, BevoBucks accepted).
Classroom expectations:
• I expect you to come to class prepared by having done the readings.
• I expect you to treat others in the class with respect. This includes putting phones on silent and no texting during
      class.
In turn, I will:
• Post assigned readings and assignments to Canvas in a timely manner (at least 2 weeks ahead of time)
• Return assignments/exams in a timely manner (~within one week).

                                   ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING POLICIES
Grades for the semester will be based on the following components:
                           Exam 1 …………………………………………                              20%
                           Exam 2 …………………………………………                              20%
                          Research proposal project …………………..                   20%
                          In class assignments & activities ................... 15%
                          Informal reading responses ………………….                   10%
                          Participation, discussion, & attendance ……            15%
Final grades will be calculated using the following scale (plus/minus will be applied):
         A = 100-89.5           B = 89.49-79.5          C = 79.49-69.5           D = 69.49-59.5       F = < 59.49
 Exams (40%). There will be 2 non-cumulative exams during class time which will cover all lecture material and
   assigned readings. Exams will be objective format (e.g. true/false, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short-
   answer) as well as 1 long short-answer question. Possible questions for long short-answers will be posted
   before the exam and the actual question will be chosen exam day. Study guides will be posted on Canvas 3-5
   days before the exam, but you will need to complete an online practice quiz to gain access.
   Make-up exams will be given ONLY with documented proof of dire emergency or illness. You must contact me
   within three days of a missed exam to qualify for a make-up.
 Research proposal project (20%). You will be expected to become an expert on the ecology of a primate
   species of your choice and design a research proposal for your species relating to one of the major topics
   discussed in class. You will present your information on the ecology of your species, your proposed research
   question and hypotheses, and a brief description of your proposed methods in a scientific poster format at the
   end of the semester. More information will be provided separately.
 In class activities (15%). There will be multiple in-class activities throughout the semester, including 2 all-day in
   class activities that will involve writing and preparing material before class and/or submitting an individual
   summary of the activity done by your group (“Designing a research study” and “Teaching a sensory ecology
   question”). More information will be provided separately.
 Informal reading responses (10%): There will be 7 reading responses over the semester (~up to 1 typed page
   each). Responses are due by 11:59 PM on the day prior to the class discussion and are submitted through
   Canvas. Late assignments will be accepted until the start of class but the grade will be docked 10%. After
   starting class, no late assignments will be accepted as they are the basis for class discussion.
 Participation, discussion, and attendance (15%): Participation is an important component of this class, and
   you are expected to come prepared having done the readings. All lectures will be interactive and in most cases
   will involve in-class activities, where you will be asked to think about material we have been working through
   and to prepare questions or responses to prompts. Your written responses (for example, “one-minute-essays”
   on concepts that we have covered) will be collected and used to assess attendance and participation. On days
   where articles have been assigned for class discussion, you are expected to come with questions prepared
   and participate in discussions. Attendance will be taken randomly throughout the semester. Missed quizzes/in-
   class activities cannot be made up.
Late work. Except where discussed previously in the Assignments and Grading Policies or specific assignment
   handouts, late work will be accepted but will incur a penalty of 10% for every day late.
 Regrading Policy: Grade disputes must be turned in to me in writing within 1 week of when the exam is returned.
   The student must include a 1 page explanation per question of why (s)he thinks that his/her answer is correct.
   Simple errors in addition can be corrected immediately. Students wishing to appeal a grade for one of the
   writing assignments, have 1 week to appeal their grade by turning in a 1 page explanation of why (s)he thinks
   that his/her paper should be regraded.

                                                 COURSE POLICIES
Statement on Learning Success and Accessibility. Your success in this class is important to me. We will all
   need accommodations because we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you
   from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to
   meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student
   resources available through UT (see below).
Veilleux – Comparative Primate Ecology                                                                     5


    In compliance with the UT Austin policy and equal access laws, I am available to discuss appropriate academic
    accommodations that may be required for students with disabilities. Requests for academic accommodations
    are to be made during the 1st 3 weeks of the semester, except for unusual circumstances, so arrangements
    can be made. Students are encouraged to register with Student Disability Services to verify their eligibility for
    appropriate accommodations (see below).
Exam taking policies. On exam days, students will only be allowed to take a pen/pencil to their seat. All
    backpacks, book bags, purses, phones, etc. must be left at the front of the classroom. Hats with rims are not
    permitted to be worn.
Social media/discussion groups. Students are welcome to participate in online forums for study and discussion
    (e.g., a course Facebook page). However, Dr. Veilleux must be invited and permitted to join any such forum in
    order to monitor content. Please note that sharing information about an exam with a student who has not yet
    taken an exam will be considered cheating, regardless of the means by which the information is shared (e.g.,
    verbally, on a web page, via email, via text, etc.). Students who observe cheating via electronic media are
    encouraged to inform Dr. Veilleux.
Absences. Attendance will be taken randomly through the semester, and attendance is necessary for in class
    activities. The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious holidays or extenuating
    circumstances due to an emergency.
Personal Pronoun Preference. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to
    individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender,
    gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I
    will gladly honor your request to address you by a name different than what appears on the roster, and by the
    gender pronouns you use. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make
    appropriate changes to my records.
Religious Holy Days. Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If you miss
    an examination, work assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day, you will be
    given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. It is the policy
    of The University of Texas at Austin that you must notify each of your instructors at least fourteen (14)
    days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a religious holy days.
Academic Integrity. Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As
    a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold
    academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not
    your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of
    plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
    understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following
    web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
In this class, cheating and plagiarism includes (but is not limited to):
• Copying from another student's exams, in class assignment, or from any electronic device.
• Collaborating, without authorization, with another person during an exam or in preparing academic work (e.g.,
    summaries for In Class Activity assignments or Ecological Profiles).
• Copy/pasting information from sources into your assignments (you MUST use your own words to paraphrase
    the information and cite the source)
Any student found cheating (including plagiarizing) will receive a zero for the assignment, be dropped 1
letter grade for the final course grade, and be referred to the Dean of Students.

University Resources for Students
Services for Students with Disabilities. This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities,
    and abilities. If there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have
    medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building
    needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment for
    all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain

Counseling and Mental Health Center. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
    exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
    achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not
    alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience
    is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
    depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html

Title IX Reporting. Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded
educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
    1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
    2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become
        involved in a Title IX investigation.
    3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters,”
which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible
Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-
one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask
whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without
making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting
options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
