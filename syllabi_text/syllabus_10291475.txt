               Asian Regionalism and Multilateral Cooperation
                                       (GC and WR)
Asia’s rise as a region will shape the future world order. Asian regionalism as a vitally important
dimension of Asia’s rise has attracted critical attention of Asia experts and policy makers. This
course first addresses the nature, functional principles, leadership, and policy making process of
contemporary Asian regionalism in comparison with the experiences of European integration.
We also explore the linkage between the momentum of Asian integration and contemporary
Asian nationalism. Then we will introduce and assess the origins and its developments of leading
regional cooperation mechanisms: ASEAN, China-Japan-ROK Summit Meeting,
SAARC/BIMSTEC, and SCO. Finally, in terms of engaging with the Asian multilateral
cooperation we will discuss policies and strategies of major powers, particularly, the United
States and China.
This course contains four main parts:
1, Comparison between Asian Regionalism and European Experiences: Concepts, principles,
leadership, and policy making process;
2. Asian Regionalism and Asian Nationalism: explore the linkage between the emerging Asian
cooperation and contemporary Asian nationalism, focusing on Chinese nationalism, Indian
nationalism, and Japanese nationalism;
3. Introduce four most important cooperation mechanisms: Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) in Southeast Asia; China-Japan-ROK Summit Meeting in Northeast Asia;
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in South Asia; and Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Central Asia;
4. Major Powers' Responses to Asian Cooperation: Focus on American and Chinese Strategies
for engaging with Asian Integration and multilateral cooperation.

This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly
during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your
instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or
more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing
Flag classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication,
Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating
Board.
This course also carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices,
beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Grading Policy:
1. Two take-home essays (6-7 pages) 40%
2. One 12-page term paper, 50%
  Note: Writing of the term paper includes the paper proposal, the first draft
    (15 points), and the second (revised) draft (25 points), and the final draft
    (10 points).
3. Class participation, 10%
    Overall class participation/attendance may be reflected in a plus or minus up to
    l0 points in determining the course grade.
