     target language. You are welcome to ask questions in English outside of the class.
Course Requirements:
1. Attendance
   •     Because of the cumulative nature of language learning, it is essential that students keep
         up with course work on a daily basis and attend all classes. It is extremely important to
         attend and be prepared for all class sessions according to the daily schedule to be
         provided.

         day of tardiness (coming late or leaving early or leaving and coming back during the
         class period) counts as 1/2 absence.

2. Participation
   •    Your active participation in class activities will greatly enhance your progress as well as
        others in Japanese. Students’ active participation is also a very important factor to
        make this Japanese course fruitful and enjoyable. Be careful! Even if you are physically
        in class, you cannot get the day’s participation points without speaking out.
   •    No food, no chewing-gums! You cannot speak properly with something in your

        turn off and put it in your bag for the duration of the class.
   •    Do not disturb your classmates and the instructor by chatting, sleeping, or studying
        other subjects, etc.
   •    In addition, studying other subjects, chatting in English with your class-mates, texting,
         checking or reading phones/laptops/tablets/other books/magazines and etc. may
         penalize you (up to -2%).

        •      Only in rare cases, will students be allowed to make up the tests missed during
               their absences. We will abide by this rule quite strictly. The instructor reserves the
               right to judge whether to allow work to be made up.
   B.    Final Exam:
        •      You will have grammar and reading tests as a final written exam (Lesson 1-6) to
               evaluate your understanding of the grammars and expressions introduced in class
