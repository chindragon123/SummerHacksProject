Course Description.
The importance of brand storytelling continues to grow with new modes of message sharing. As more brands move to a story/content marketing approach, this
class shows students how to create tomorrow’s engaging, sharable content. The course examines how classic elements of storytelling, semiotics, and
symbolism can be used to create and manage a modern brand’s story and “meaning.” Students will create visual, verbal, and video examples of brand
storytelling that go beyond traditional advertising and PR.
Course Outcomes.
By the end of this course, you should demonstrate an understanding of how to:
    Think of brands in terms of story
    Analyze, construct, and manage meaning for brands
    Create a strategic brand story platform that works in a variety of media
    Execute an ongoing content marketing plan

Coursework.
You'll be assigned various projects to learn the theoretical fundamentals as well as practical skills of creating modern brand messages. Each course section
includes small projects, quizzes, and a capstone Major Project to demonstrate both your theoretical and hands-on skills. Minor Daily Projects are simple tasks
that can often be completed during class, and include quizzes and small projects that are graded pass-fail. Major projects allow you more freedom to
demonstrate your growing skills, carry more grade weight, and are graded more subjectively.
Grades.
Here’s how your final course grade will be calculated:
60% = 4 Major Projects (15% each; graded)
40% = Daily Projects (most class days; quiz or complete/incomplete; lowest grades dropped)
Final letter grades are calculated according to these cutoffs—no exceptions:
A = 94 to 100 A- = 90 to <94 B+ = 87 to <90 B = 87 to <84 B- = 84 to <80 C+ = 80 to <77 C = 77 to <74 C- = 74 to <70 D+ = 70 to <67 D = 67 to <64 D- =
64 to <61 F = 61 to 0
Policies:
Late Work
As a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry, you are expected to complete every module and project on time – no exceptions. All projects are due
on Canvas at the date and time indicated on the Class Calendar.
Emergencies happen, so you are allowed one “Late Pass” without penalty, which gives you an additional 2 days (48 hours) to complete a single project.
Thereafter, you will not be able to turn in any late projects under any circumstances, unless you already have a prior exemption for a Religious Holy Day, a
school-sponsored trip, or a doctor's note, obituary, or other serious issue that you can document with a written excuse.
