Description*:
         This course focuses on post-abolition Afro-Brazilian life, history, culture, politics, and
literature. It engages a wide range of literary texts, socio-cultural movements, visual arts, and
cultural performances, while raising a number of questions that would lead to provocative
midterm and final research papers, while simultaneously honing students’ writing skills with a
number of response papers that may be expanded into a research paper. Most concepts and issues
will be illustrated with multimedia clips or movies to ensure that students gain a richer
experience of the Afro-Brazilian diaspora world.
         Some of the questions the course will grapple with include the following: (i) What
explains the continued exclusion of Afro-Brazilians from political power?; (ii) What is the
legacy or impact of slavery within this context?; (iii) How is the concept of Africa (re)imagined,
distorted, and manipulated in this regard?; (iv)What are the discourses used to justify social
inequalities and racial discrimination in Brazil?; (v) How is the “radical” view on discrimination
silenced while the “co-opted” perspective is promoted?; (vi) What are the effects of
governmental patronage on cultural producers as they negotiate what Carl Degler calls the
“mulatto escape hatch” that fits into Gilberto Freyre’s “racial democracy” model; and (vii) What
are the limitations of ideology in an era of “globalization” and pragmatism? These among other
issues will form the basis of the course which will additionally analyze the social condition that
goes beyond the more apparent “culture game”; and must also be seen as a political game
towards visibility, participation, gendered equality, and empowerment.
                                                                                                    1


Objectives:
    1. Students will be able to meet requirements for writing and global flags.
    2. Students will be exposed to the dynamics of coping mechanism with social inequalities in
       Brazil as they mostly affect the Afro-Brazilian population.
    3. Students will not only be exposed to elements of style, they will also improve their
       writing skills by having opportunities to re-write most of their assignments.
    4. Transnational resonances will be invoked for comparative analysis within contexts and
       texts in order to see the African Diaspora beyond a continental prism.

                                        GENERALITIES
                                WRITING FLAG COMPONENT:
       IMPORTANT NOTE FROM THE COLLEGE OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES
        “This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give
        students experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect
        to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive
        feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the
        opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and to read and discuss your peers’ work.
        You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your
        written work.”
CUSTOMIZED LIBRARY VISIT
In order to help you navigate “information literacy resources” available on UT campus and
through internet access, a formal customized library visit has been set up at the Perry-Castaneda
Library (PCL) in Learning Lab 4 (Main Floor) on Monday, September 24, during class time at
1PM. Your attendance at this one-time workshop is not only required, it also counts for 10% of
the final grade.
Before Library Visit:
    1. Please, watch this video: http://guides.lib.utexas.edu/choosetopic.
    2. Please, view also a sample assignment for preparing an Annotated Bibliography:
        https://www.lib.utexas.edu/signaturecourses/resources/create-annotated-
        bibliography
ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION
Given the writing intensive nature of the class, skipping classes will put you at a disadvantage as
lectures on elements of style or customized comments cannot be repeated once shared with the
class. Also, you cannot participate if you are absent. This segment counts for 15%.
                                                                                                   3


POSITION PAPERS
These are meant to provide your critical reactions or responses to your readings. When properly
done, it involves a brief exposition of the main arguments of the reading, your critical analysis,
and a “position” taken in a form of reflection or how the reading affected you in a personal way.
What strikes you in a reading may not strike someone else. It is about your own position not
someone else’s. The length of each paper is 2 double-spaced pages. This exercise counts for
15%.
RE-WRITTEN PAPERS
As part of the expectation of this class—that you improve your writing systematically over the
course of the semester, this is an opportunity to hone your writing skills by using the suggestions
you have been provided with to improve and strengthen your paper. In order to show that you
have followed the instructions, you are expected to attach the first version to the revised
paper each time. The excuse that you “forgot,” “lost your paper,” “did not know,” “missed the
class it was announced,” “had the flu” or “will scan or email it to me” is NOT acceptable.
Length is same as the position papers: 2 double-spaced pages each. This exercise counts for
10%.
MIDTERM EXAM/PAPER
This is to get you ready for your “final research paper” by getting started on your research paper
very early through a combined assignment on a RESEARCH PROPOSAL and an
ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY. The exam expects that you: (i) present your research
proposal in a cogent manner by advancing a thesis statement of your paper and the main
arguments that support it in one cogent page; and (ii) prepare an annotation of your working
bibliography where you synthesize and analyze your readings of a number of articles and/or
books (at least 5 entries of annotation of articles and or books, according to the topic) by listing
an entry for each reading in few paragraphs for a total of 3 pages. Overall, the assignment is at
least 3 pages (one-page “research proposal” as a cover page, and a two-page analytical
“annotation” for a total of 3 pages). This segment counts for 15%.
CAPOEIRA REPORT
This is a one-page reflection on the in-class practical capoeira knowledge and experience with a
Master Capoeirista (Prof. Dare) for a week. The assignment counts for 5% of the final grade.
GROUP/ORAL PRESENTATION
This is an opportunity for team work while not losing your individuality. When properly
coordinated, different aspects of a subject matter or topic may be presented by a group and or
presented as a PANEL on the due date. Regardless of how the group is formed (similar topics) or
disparate topics within the same group, each presenter will have 7-8 minutes to present to the
rest of the class at the end of the semester. You need to know the group you are in and not
complain at the end of the semester that you don’t have a group to present in. You may use any
multimedia approach you wish as long as you prepare well in advance and not have a situation
where your laptop malfunctions and you blame it on technology. This segment accounts for
10% of your grade.
                                                                                                     4


FINAL RESEARCH PAPER
This is a topic you have researched and will develop throughout the semester. A list of possible
topics will be distributed before MIDTERM. Any of your response papers could be further
developed into a research paper if properly coordinated. Likewise your midterm assignment is
meant as a “midway” moment for you to work on a potential final research topic in terms of a
Research Proposal and an attached Annotated Bibliography. The assignment counts for 15%.
THE STANDARD OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AT UT-Austin
        A fundamental principle for any educational institution, academic integrity is highly
valued and seriously regarded at The University of Texas at Austin, as emphasized in the
standards of conduct. More specifically, you and other students are expected to "maintain
absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in scholastic work" undertaken at the
University (19-128, Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities). This is a very basic
expectation that is further reinforced by the University’s Honor Code.
        At a minimum, you should complete any assignments, exams, and other scholastic
endeavors with the utmost honesty, which requires you to:
        •          acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts;
        •          complete your assignments independently unless expressly authorized to seek
                   or obtain assistance in preparing them;
        •          follow instructions for assignments and exams, and observe the standards of
                   your academic discipline;
        •          and avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself
                   or another student.
        •          students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations
                   from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
                   Students with Disabilities, 471-6259.
ON PLAGIARISM
        The academic tradition demands that you cite your sources if you have used the ideas or
words belonging to others. Failure to do so constitutes plagiarism (academic theft) and can cost
you your status as well as academic integrity that has serious consequences.
ON CAMPUS CARRY
        I do not allow any concealed weapon in my office. I would also ask you to declare if you
are carrying one before you step into my office. Otherwise feel free to exercise your rights but be
aware also that the best safety you can have is to have a heart full of love for humanity. The fear
of the other is indeed due to the absence of love.
                                                                                                    5

      Suggested Reflection/Question for Paper 1
      To what extent is The Color of Tenderness a subtle, innocent, and “apolitical”
      autobiographical piece that is written from the viewpoint of a female child? Should the
      reader excuse or question the narrative voice for not openly challenging social
      inequalities and racial discrimination? Is it enough to expose the complexities of the
      racial situation without really taking a position? As a reader, what do you take away from
      this award-winning piece of Afro-Brazilian literature and its gendered dynamics?

     Suggested Reflection/Question for Paper 2
     The blurb of the edited volume, Black Brazil, states: “This collection of essays brings
     together diverse perspectives on multiple dimensions of Afro-Brazilian culture, with a
     common focus on the construction of identities and the ways grassroots cultural
     expressions are linked to social organization and mobilization.” Focusing on one or more
     aspects that struck you in particular, reflect on the complexity of Brazilian national
     identity and how Afro-Brazilians feel that they still have to struggle for their sense of
     belonging and citizenship in a “racial democracy.”.

     For Richard S. Heckler, “Capoeira weaves fighting, music, dance, prayer, and ritual into
     an urgent strategy by which people live, struggle, celebrate, and survive together.” Based
     on your reading of Bira Almeida’s Capoeira: A Brazilian Art Form, what aspect of this

   Suggested Reflection/Question for Paper 4
   The poems in Finally…Us celebrate the visibility of Afro-Brazilian women’s writing
   while at the same time challenging the stereotypes that have kept them “behind the
   curtain.” Selecting a few poems to illustrate your perspective, discuss the women’s sense
   of being marginalized by the mainstream Brazilian society. How do you explain the
   contradiction in the compelling female power contained in what Conceição Evaristo calls
   the “continuous motion of the world” (‘I-Woman’ [p. 71])?
