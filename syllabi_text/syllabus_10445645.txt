TEXT:            Archaeology and Humanity’s Story – Deborah Olszewski, 2020
                 Chapter assignments are listed on a separate page.
GENERAL COURSE CONTENT:
    1.   This course will introduce “Prehistoric Archaeology” beginning with a discussion
         of the types of archaeology in practice today. A brief history of the discipline will
         be presented as well as summaries of certain field and analytical techniques.
    2.   The major emphasis of the course will be the study of human prehistory. Included
         in the topics of discussion are human origins, the peopling of the New World,
         hunters-and-gatherers, plant and animal domestication, the development of
         complex societies, and the decline of ancient civilizations.
    3.   Among the ancient cultures examined in the class are Paleo-Indians of the New
         World, the Shang of China, the Anasazi of the American Southwest, the Maya
         and Aztecs of Mesoamerica, and the Inca of Peru. Class lectures and readings
         may be supplemented by guest lectures, demonstrations/hands-on experience,
         and films/slides where appropriate (some of this within the lab setting).


    4.   A schedule of planned topics is presented (below). This serves primarily as a
         guide to the order of topics. The actual amount of time spent on a particular issue
         or culture will vary according to the needs of the class. Given the available time
         near the semester’s end, we may discuss a case or two of “fantastic” archaeology
         (for example, the story of Atlantis or the “evidence” for extra-terrestrial
         presence/influence in ancient times, etc.).
COURSE GRADING: Evaluation in this course will be through five tests. Five (5) tests
are administered and please note that there are NO MAKE-UPS since the lowest grade
will be dropped. The top four (4) scores are averaged to equal 90% of your grade. The
10% balance of the course grade is based upon participation in the lab component
section. The lab component may be hands-on activities as well as films, etc. There are
NO MAKE-UP Lab classes. If you miss two (2) or more lab sessions, you automatically
receive a “F” for the lab component. An “F” for the lab component also means an “F”
for the course, regardless of your class average.
When tests are “returned,” any questions or need of modification to the evaluation must
be done within two class meetings of the returned test. Test results will not be
reevaluated at the end of the semester. Any questions, confusion about the course
grading, etc. should be clarified/settled with Prof. Valdez as soon as possible.
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
