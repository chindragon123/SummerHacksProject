Course Overview
This class is an overview of the business of film and media focused on past, present
and emerging practices from both a major motion picture studio, independent and
disruptor perspective concentrating on the legal, business, practical, strategic,
economic and business models – “follow the money” - that drive show business. The
class will also include exposure to the critical practical expertise required to satisfy
the multi-faceted demands of producing content in the ever-changing media
landscape. In addition, the disrupting influence of technological advances, changing
consumer habits and the rise of ‘international’ will be analyzed as well as the
tensions between content/distribution, business/creative, and risk/reward, to
name but a few paradigms, that are at the core of understanding the eternal beating
heart of the entertainment industry.
Information will be presented in class from your instructor, handouts, reading
assignments and industry professionals.

Assignments
Per the Canvas syllabus dates you can instantly access, you will find written
assignments are due to be posted onto Canvas no later than midnight the day before
the next class session (for example, the Class Assignment which is based on material
covered in the previous class is due to be submitted to Canvas no later than
midnight on the Tuesday immediately before the next Class). Please do not submit
printed material unless requested. Make sure your name appears on the title of the
document and the calendar date of the assignment on the paper itself. Extensions
will be difficult to come by. However, if extenuating circumstances arise, like a
death in the family or your own illness, please notify me via text or email before the
deadline so that the matter may be discussed.
Special Guest Speakers
Industry professionals will be scheduled to offer their insights and personal
experiences. Owing to unpredictable schedules, there may be last minute changes
which will be communicated to all students via Canvas and email (with UTLA in all
caps prominent in the subject line). You will be expected to research the speakers,
companies, and their work ahead of time to ask them questions. This is a unique
opportunity for you to speak directly with professionals. These visits are highly
valuable and you will be expected to participate in the Q&A for each speaker.
It will be a CLASS ASSIGNMENT automatically due after each Guest Speaker’s
class to write a brief summary of insights (minimum 1 page per speaker) of what
you learned from that Guest Speaker and post that to Canvas in advance of the
class the following week.
Absences/Tardy
See above in “Assignments.” If you have a legitimate scheduling problem (this does
NOT include business lunches, family visits or screenings!) please contact me prior
to class via email, text, or a phone call to the office. Unexcused absence from more
than one (1) class will result in a deduction of up to 5 points from your overall grade
for each individual absence. Likewise, being tardy or leaving early after the first
such instance, will also, at my discretion, result in the deduction of overall grade
points up to the same level as an absence. At NO time may your internship be used
as an excuse for being late or missing class.
Required Texts
The Biz by Schuyler M. Moore, 5th Edition . In addition, there are often required
readings that will be made available via Canvas. Canvas should be checked on a
regular basis so that you are up-to-date with required readings.

address. Students are expected to check email on a frequent and regular basis in
order to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that
certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that email be

University of Texas at Austin that you must notify your instructor at least fourteen

Scholastic Dishonesty: The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating,
plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, falsifying academic records, and any act
designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic
dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other
assignment, and submission of essentially the same written assignment for two
courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus,
you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty
damages both the student’s learning experience and readiness for the future
demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on scholastic
dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University. More information on student
conduct and academic integrity is available at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php.
