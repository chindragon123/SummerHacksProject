Course Description:
This course offers the rare opportunity to master Ancient Greek in a way few other mortals have ever
first learned it. We are happy to have you join us for the experience this summer. You will read a wide
range of Ancient Greek texts with proficiency using a simplified linguistics approach that gives you
intuitive knowledge of how the language works.
A typical Ancient Greek textbook focuses on a select few prose authors from the same city-state (Athens)
at the same period in time (the Classical Period), emphasizing the rote memorization of chart after chart
after chart (the so-called word-and-paradigm approach) while reading artificial Greek sentences and
short adapted passages decontextualized from their original text. Gareth Morgan’s Lexis is not your
typical Greek textbook. Its linguistics approach teaches you to predict and analyze words, whether or
                                                     1


not you have seen them before, thereby significantly decreasing the need to rely on pre-memorized charts
and lists. As a result, you can read both prose and poetry in a variety of Ancient Greek dialects written
across at least a millennium of ancient Greek history. By the end of the summer, you will have read three
stories from Herodotus, a speech by Lysias, all of Plato’s Apology, an entire play by Euripides, all of
Homer’s Odyssey 9, some Christian Greek, some papyri, inscriptions, and much more—all in 10 weeks.
Welcome to Summer Greek!
What to Expect from Summer Greek, and a Note on the Word “Intensive”:
Summer Greek is not for the faint of heart. Each weekday of your summer will look like this:
         8:00-8:30: Office hours (in WAG 10)
         8:30-9:40: Section 1 (required attendance)
         9:40-9:50: Morning break
         9:50-11.00: Section 2 (required attendance)
         11:00-12:00: Lunch
         12:00-1:10: Section 3 (required attendance)
         1:10-1:20: Afternoon break
         1:20-2:30: Section 4 (required attendance)
         2:30-3:30: Office hours (in WAG 10)
Thus, you will be in class for five hours each day. Former students suggest that you plan to spend at least
three hours outside of class each day reviewing that day’s material and preparing the next day’s
assignment. It should therefore go without saying that you cannot take on other significant
responsibilities (e.g. part-time jobs, other courses) this summer. Note further: weekends afford you
critical time to catch up, review, and prepare, so use them wisely! Like training for a marathon, this
course requires constant, steady, regular distance runs with occasional sprint intervals built in. Each day
of class is equivalent to a week of a regular semester. You can fall problematically behind by missing
even part of one day. Do not do this.
That said, you get out of the program what you put into it. Many of our most successful students were
not language geniuses. They were, instead, dedicated students who struggled, like all of us, but
consistently worked hard, asked for help as soon as it was needed, and kept a healthy momentum from
beginning to end. Nor, by the way, is the program just for those who wish to work professionally on
ancient languages. Indeed, the program has had as its students a number of top-notch scholars, but
lawyers, scientists, musicians, foreign aid workers, and soldiers have also profited from Summer Greek.
Course Requirements, Grading, and Placement:
         Participation and attendance: 10%
         Quizzes: 20%
         Three exams: 70% (20% + 25% + 25%)
Participation and attendance. The only way to learn a language, even (if not especially) a dead one, is
through active participation. Your participation grade does not reflect how well you know the language,
the brilliance of your translations, or the frequency with which you answer questions correctly. Rather,
it reflects your effort, thoughtfulness, and engagement with the material. Your participation grade will
be negatively impacted if you arrive late to a daily session (of which there are four), leave a session
                                                     2


early, do anything with your phone in class, or are otherwise disruptive. You are allowed one unexcused
absence. Each additional unexcused absence will result in a deduction of 1% from your final grade.
Quizzes. There will be regular quizzes, usually one a day. These cannot be made up even in the case of
a University-approved absence. We will, however, drop your lowest quiz grade. Quizzes are short
(typically 5 minutes), targeted, and their content clearly explained the day before. Only quizzes from
summer session 2 count toward your final grade (see below).
Exams. There will be several exams over the summer, but only three “author” exams during session 2
count toward your final grade. Your weakest exam of the three will count for 20% of your final grade;
the other two will count for 25% each. We will give you a schedule of quizzes and exams for session 2
in due course.
***Only the quizzes and exams from summer session 2 will count toward your final grade. This is so
that your grade reflects where you are at the end of the summer, not what inevitable roadblocks you
struggled to overcome along the way. That said, the material from summer session 1 is a sine qua non
for success in session 2. You must take that material extremely seriously.***
Grading Scale. A = 100-93, A- = 92-90, B+ = 89-87, B = 86-84, B- = 83-80, C+ = 79-77, C = 76-74, C-
= 73-70, D+ = 69-67, D = 66-64, D- = 63-60, F = 59 and below. Grades will not be scaled and fractions
will not be rounded up. E.g. 89.9 is a B+.
Placement. Upon completion of the course, you will earn two things: (i) an official letter grade for the
12 credit hours of the course, submitted to the Registrar, and (ii) a placement recommendation for a
subsequent Greek course, whether here at UT or at another institution. The official grade and the
placement recommendation are distinct.

Disabilities and Accommodations:
UT provides appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more
information,      contact     SSD       at    512-417-6259        or      find    them     online     at
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/. Students who use the service must provide an official
accommodation letter authorizing specific accommodations as soon as possible and before the graded
assignment in question.
Religious Holidays:
                                                     3


Let us know as soon as possible if you need to miss a class, assignment, or other required class activity
due to a religious holiday. The University’s “Religious Days Policy” is online here:
http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/.
iStuff in the Classroom:
The use of cellphones, laptops, abacuses, etc. is not permitted in the classroom without our prior
approval. Use of these objects will detrimentally harm your learning. If we simply sense the existence
of an iThing in your immediate vicinity, you will be marked absent for that day.
Scholastic Dishonesty:
No cheating allowed. Any work that is not entirely and authentically your own—unless it is a sanctioned
group assignment—is considered scholastic dishonesty and will result in a 0 for the assignment and an
F for the course. We will also report you to Student Judicial Services. Reading a prepared translation in
class, even if you are its author, is cheating. For more information on what counts as scholastic
dishonesty, contact Student Judicial Services at 512-471-2841, or find them online at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php.
Late Work/Make-Ups:
Only exams may be made-up, and only with University-approved documentation (e.g. from a physician
or coroner on letterhead explicitly telling us to excuse you from the specific hour you were absent from
class that day; a photograph of your severed finger turns out not to be University-approved
documentation).
