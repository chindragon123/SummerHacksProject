Course Description:
For almost seventy years, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has influenced significantly our
understanding of Second Temple Judaism, the formation of the Bible, and the origins of the
religious movements of Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. This course presents an in-depth study
of the Dead Sea Scrolls in order to understand better the development of law, interpretation,
ritual, messianism, apocalypticism, and prayer in the late Second Temple period. This course will
include discussion of the archaeology of the Qumran community, textual production and
transmission in antiquity, scribal practices in antiquity, and pseudonymous authorship.
Prerequisites:
None
Global Cultures Flag:
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your
familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and
histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Learning Goals:
After completing this course successfully, students should be able to:
• Outline the development of Jewish history between the third century BCE and the second
     century CE
• Give an overview of the types of literature found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.
• Describe the history of the group associated with the Dead Sea Scrolls.
• Situate the practices and ideas described in the Dead Sea Scrolls in the landscape of Second
     Temple Judaism.
• Articulate at least three ways that the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has contributed to
     our understanding of the development of the Bible and interpretive practices in antiquity.

Major Course Requirements and Assignments:
(1) Participation counts for ten percent of the course grade, and one cannot participate if he or
     she is not in class. That being said, I understand that students sometimes miss class. More
     than two unexcused absences will result in a lowering of a student’s participation grade. If
     you are going to be absent from class, please let me know as soon as feasible and provide
     any documentation for an excused absence. If there is a personal or medical reason for
     multiple absences, please alert me. I understand that students may be hesitant to speak in
     class for a variety of reasons. If students have any concerns about class participation and
     would like to meet with me to discuss alternative ways to participate and/or strategies to
     improve class participation, please do not hesitate to contact me.
(2) Map Quiz – Short quiz on locations in maps discussed in the first class sessions. This test will
     be given on Tuesday, June 11 during class.
(3) Mid-term test – The format of this thirty-minute test will consist of identifications (terms
     and passages). This test will be given on Friday, June 21 during class.
(4) One 3–4 page paper – This paper will involve close reading of a primary source that has
     been discussed in class. Specific instructions will be passed out in-class. The paper will be
     due on the following dates during the semester: Monday, June 24.
(5) Cumulative final test – The format of this one-hour test will consist of identifications (terms
     and passages). This test will be given on Thursday, July 11 during class.

CLASS SESSIONS AND COURSE SCHEDULE
Ground Rules for Participation in Discussion:
This course is a critical introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is important to emphasize that
the course does not expect students to have a particular religious perspective. Students who
have such a perspective are encouraged to bring their own experiences into the classroom
while respecting the opinions (and individuals) that may challenge those views. As such, I ask
that during class discussions you (1) listen carefully and respectfully to the viewpoints of your
classmates; (2) make sure you understand the position offered by your classmate (asking
clarification questions if necessary) before responding; and (3) offer your contributions to the
conversation respectfully and in the interests of advancing critical, academic discussion.
Course Outline (subject to change):
Note: Assigned readings must be completed before the date on which they are to be discussed
in class! Do not SKIM the readings from ancient texts (i.e., selections from Josephus, the Bible,
or the Dead Sea Scrolls). They must be read S-L-O-W-L-Y, or else you will not understand them
or be able to articulate what you do not understand about them.

COURSE POLICIES
Use of Class Materials:
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, and homework
assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the class materials is a
violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.
Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor
may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty,
which could result in further disciplinary action. Such violations include, among other things,
uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other
current or future students.
University Policy on Religious Holidays:
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence
as possible (at least fourteen days in advance), so that arrangements can be made to complete
an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.
Extension Policy:
Extensions on papers and exams will only be granted for documented, exigent circumstances.
Late Assignment Policy:
Assignments turned in after their deadline will be accepted but with a reduction in grade on the
assignment equal to one-third of a letter grade per day (or portion of a day that an assignment
is late). For instance, if an assignment is due at 1 p.m. on a Friday and a student turns the
assignment in the following Monday at 9 a.m., the assignment will be considered three days
late, and its grade will be reduced by one full letter grade.
Accessible Education:
The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. You will need to provide
documentation to the Dean of Student’s Office so that the most appropriate accommodations
can be determined. Specialized services are available on campus through Services for Students
with Disabilities (SSB 4.104, 512-471-6259). Any student who requires special accommodations
must obtain a letter that documents the disability from the Services for Students with
Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement (512-471-6259 voice
or 512-471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). Present the letter to the
professor at the beginning of the semester so that needed accommodations can be discussed.
The student should remind the professor of any testing accommodations no later than five
business days before an exam. For more information, visit
