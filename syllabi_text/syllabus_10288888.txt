                                           GENERAL GUIDELINES
Plagiarism and Academic Integrity
(From https://ugs.utexas.edu/flags/faculty-resources/teaching/syllabus)
Using someone else’s work in your own writing without giving proper credit is considered plagiarism, a
serious form of academic dishonesty that can result in severe penalties. Copying someone else’s work,
buying a paper and submitting it as your own, copying and pasting text (even with changes), or borrowing


images from an online source, are some examples of plagiarism. Even if you plagiarize accidentally, you
can be held responsible and penalized.
Learning to cite sources appropriately is an important part of becoming a professional. When you are
unsure about citation, you are encouraged to ask your instructor (who is already an expert in the
discipline) what is appropriate in the context of your assignment. Consultants at The University Writing
Center can also help you determine whether you are citing sources correctly—and they have helpful
guides online for using direct quotations and paraphrasing. Reviewing those skills will help you feel
confident that you are handling sources professionally in your writing. You can read the University’s
definition of plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty in Sec. 11–402 of the Student Conduct
Code. For more information, visit the Dean of Students’ site.
Title IX:
 If you have experienced any form of sexual or gender-based harassment or violence, dating or domestic
violence, or anything else which has made you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, I encourage you to talk to
any faculty or staff member. Please note that we are obligated as mandatory reporters to notify
administrators who specialize in these types of situations. The University’s Title IX office is available to
support you. Should you feel the need, you can contact the Counseling and Mental Health Center
(CMHC) for additional help with mental health and/or high-stress concerns.
Accessibility:
Accessibility concerns often present issues in both private and public spaces. University faculty a staff
strive to provide necessary accommodations and assistance so that individuals with various abilities can
access programs, services and facilities on campus. If you find that you need accommodations, please
provide a letter notifying me of your needs. This letter can be obtained from Services for Students with
Disabilities, located in the Student Services Building. For more information, contact the Office of the
Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY, or visit their website at:
www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.
Flags:
This course satisfies the requirements of the Global Cultures flag. You can expect to learn about diverse
global cultures and perspectives.
                                       CLASSROOM GUIDELINES
Attendance:
All students are expected to attend each class. You are allowed TWO unexcused absences. All other
unexcused absences will result in an automatic point deduction from the student’s “Class Participation”
grade. Please be on time; extreme tardiness will be counted as an absence.
Classroom Ethics:
The topics in this course may be difficult to discuss and there may be moments where our conversations
can become complicated and rather heated. Respect, civility, and decency are mandatory for this class
and our time together. Listen attentively and proactively when others are speaking and be respectful when
engaging one another in discussion. Each of us is here to learn and engage in healthy academic exchange.
Acknowledge that some participants may have experiences that are different than your own. Please listen
to the perspectives of others while remaining grounded in the course readings and academic contributions
of the authors.
Inclusivity:
At its core, this course embraces a multiplicity of voices and perspectives. As such, it adheres to the
principles of diversity and inclusion integral to the academic community. As such, we invite class
participants to share their perspectives in the classroom environment which fosters healthy academic


dialogue. We also understand that encountering people and ideas that challenge one’s strongly held beliefs
and perspectives is a defining and invaluable feature of a university education.
I invite your feedback on ways that we can, as a community of learners, respectfully and productively
assist and challenge one another in our individual and collective academic growth. For a start, if you
wish, please let me and the class know your preferred name and pronouns.
Course evaluations:
Students in this class are expected to complete course evaluations. Near the end of the semester, you will
receive an email with a link to an on-line evaluation form. Your evaluation of the course is extremely
valuable to me, the Department of Religious Studies, and the administration; I take your feedback
seriously and will use it to try to improve the course.
Electronics:
YOU CANNOT BE FULLY PRESENT AND ON YOUR ELECTONIC DEVICE. Please refrain
from cell phone and computer usage during class unless you have accommodations cleared through the
professor. You may bring in daily readings on a tablet, but please disarm your wireless and detach your
keyboard. If I see you on your phone, I will deduct points from your participation grade.
Written Assignments:
All written assignments should be typed in Word with Times New Roman 12pt font, double-spaced, and
with one-inch margins. Your work will be graded on the clarity and technical proficiency of your writing
in addition to content. Incorrect spelling and grammar will negatively impact your grade.
I strongly encourage you to use the services offered by the University Writing Center. The UWC offers
45-minute, one-on-one consultations with UT students on any piece of writing. You may visit up to three
times per assignment. The consultants are well trained, and the cost of the service is covered in your
tuition. If you wish to make an appointment, you may do so through the UWC website: uwc.utexas.edu.
Late Work:
Daily assignments, quizzes, and presentations will not be accepted late. Major assignments like essays will
be accepted late at a penalty of 10 points per day (1 day late, and your grade starts at a 90; 2 days late,
and your grade starts at a 80). A paper or project turned in on the due date but late in the class period or
after class is still considered late. I DO NOT ACCEPT LATE FINAL PAPERS.
Texts: Your required textbook can be found in the Co-op. All other texts will be posted on Canvas.
Grade Assignments:
  93 to 100 A                 73 to 76 C
  90 to 92 A-                 70 to 72 C-
  87 to 89 B+                 67 to 69 D+
  83 to 86 B                  63 to 66 D
  80 to 82 B-                 60 to 62 D-
