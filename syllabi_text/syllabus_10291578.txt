Course Description
This course examines a variety of Japanese popular manga and anime, focusing mainly on those
works Japan has exported since becoming an economic superpower in the 1980s. We will
explore utopian/dystopian expression in Japanese sci-fi narratives, examine the ways that the
Japanese entertainment industry has responded to changing notions of gender, and chart the
evolution of traditional genre categories as they accommodate new hybridic representations of
the posthuman body. We will also consider the significance of global fandom with the rise of
the transnational otaku, and its relevance to Japan’s exercise of soft power.
Required Texts
Anime: A Critical Introduction (AACI), Denison, Rayna (2015)
ISBN: 978-1847884794
Anime From Akira to Howl's Moving Castle: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation,
Napier, Susan, (2005) ISBN: 978-1403970527
Course Objectives:
    ● Students will read, view, analyze, interpret, discuss and write critically about
        contemporary Japanese popular media.
    ● Students will learn to perform close textual analysis, and demonstrate their findings
        through responses to test and discussion questions.
    ● Students will demonstrate their ability to visually decode complex media messages with
        culturally specific meanings through discussions and written tests.
    ● Students will construct a persuasive argument on behalf of a particular example of
        Japanese popular culture, and write a brief paper supporting their views.
Course Work:
Students will be expected to view the films listed in the schedule below outside of class. For
students who can make it, we are offering weekly screenings every Thursday in PAR 201 from
5:00-7:30 pm. Most titles will also be on reserve at the Fine Arts Library, but if you have
another way to view them you are welcome to do so. In addition, there are readings listed in
the schedule, which you should read before the class when they will be covered. Many of the
readings will come from the required textbooks (indicated by the author’s name), but I have
made additional readings available on the Canvas site. There will also be discussion questions


for each week that may pertain to the readings or film. A one-paragraph response to a
question for 10 of the scheduled films will assure you full class participation points (10%). In
addition, there will be a test at the end of each unit. The test questions will be drawn from
material we have reviewed in class and will be given in multiple formats (T/F, FITB, multiple
choice, short ID, etc.). A cumulative final exam will be given at the end of the class, and
students will write a short paper (500-700 words) arguing for the inclusion of an anime of their
choosing that does not currently appear on the syllabus (see attachment).
Course Schedule:
Below is the list of screenings and readings for each week of class. Additional assignments,
readings, and other information can be found on the Canvas website at
https://utexas.instructure.com. Changes to the schedule may be made if circumstances
require. I will do my best to ensure that you receive the changes with as much advanced notice
as possible, but please check the Canvas site regularly to stay informed.

Grading Policies
Flexibility is built into the assignments to support your success in this course. If you miss a
smaller, class participation assignment, your grade will not be impacted significantly.
Consequently, the final grades are firm, and no additional curve is available.
Grading Percentages:
                                  Attendance/Participation     15%
                                  Paper                        15%
                                  Tests (4)                    40%
                                  Final Exam                   30%
                                                   4


Final Grades are assigned as follows:
93-100 = A                                              73-76.9 = C
90-92.9 = A-                                            70-72.9 = C-
87-89.9 = B+                                            67-69.9 = D+

80-82.9 = B-                                            60-62.9 = D-
77-79.9 = C+                                            below 60 = F
Global Cultures Flag
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States, in this case, Japan. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the
practices, beliefs, and histories of Japan, past or present.
Attendance/Participation
Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class, and you will accumulate attendance
points by showing up. If you have to be absent, ask a classmate for notes on any lessons you
miss. If you find there are topics that we covered while you were gone that raise questions,
please come by during office hours or schedule a meeting to discuss. Email specific questions
you have in advance so that we can make the most of our time. “What did I miss?” is not
specific enough. Participation in large, lecture style classrooms is challenging, but there will be
opportunities throughout the semester to respond to questions, both in the classroom and on
Canvas.
Student Rights & Responsibilities
Students have a right to an inclusive learning environment where they are respected, graded
fairly, provided with opportunities to freely express opinions, and guaranteed privacy and
confidentiality where appropriate. In return, each of us is responsible for treating others with
respect, listening courteously and doing our best to make the learning environment supportive
to all. If you are feeling that the class is not meeting this standard, please let the instructor or
TA know so that the issue can be addressed as quickly as possible.
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a
student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University
and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use
words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite
your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary
action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic
                                                   5


Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:

Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the
Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law,
you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For
more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
University Resources for Students
If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me
know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the
requirements of the course. There are also a range of resources on campus

      have medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific
      arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know, but also

Counseling and Mental Health Center
         There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the
         college experience is learning how to ask for help. If you or anyone you know
         experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
         depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of
Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting
and assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and
building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you
used when entering the building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform
their instructor in writing during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation,
follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given
instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin
Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office. Link to information regarding
emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at:
www.utexas.edu/emergency
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at
federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and
working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs
in our community, the university can:
         1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
         2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced
         harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
         3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
“Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to
the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related
incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or
with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they
are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies
without making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more
information about reporting options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title
IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.

                                       Japanese Popular Culture
                                         Writing Assignment
For the course writing assignment, I am giving you a chance to make a persuasive argument on
behalf of a manga/anime title that does not currently appear on the syllabus, but you feel should
be studied in future sections of this course. In making your argument, you should demonstrate
how the “work” you have chosen meets the following criteria:
        Popularity: When something is popular, it shows that the work appeals to the values of a
        significant portion of its intended audience. The work you choose should be reasonably
        popular, rather than obscure. Is it a work by a well-known artist or studio? Was it a
        blockbuster movie, or a long running TV series? Has it appeared in multi-media formats
        as part of a franchise? Can we see the work’s characters represented on clothing,
        figurines or other spin-off products? Explain how you know the work is popular, and
        why you think it is so.
        Genre: In keeping with the genre focus of the course, choose a unit or specific genre that
        the work could fit into. How does it meet those generic criteria? Does it advance the
        genre, or subvert the genre’s conventions? Is it creating a new genre by combining traits
        of existing genres? If it resembles, imitates, or parodies a previous popular work,
        mention and explain that.
        Global Cultures Connection: What does the work tell us about Japanese culture? Does
        it pull from Japan’s history, or touch upon important issues in present day society? Does
        it express fears or desires about Japan’s future? For this component, draw upon specific
        ideas and concepts discussed in the course, and make a case for why the work you have
        chosen would prove a particularly good vehicle for understanding some aspect of
        Japanese culture.
        Academic Significance: Since this is a college level course, it is important that there is at
        least one “scholarly” publication available to help interpret and explain the work. For
        this component, give the author and title of the article or review, and briefly summarize
        the author’s main thesis about the work. Then explain why this article is helpful for
        understanding the work you have chosen. Please attach the first page or abstract of the
        article (a screen shot is OK).
In addition to satisfying the above criteria, the paper should be 500-700 words in length (double
spaced) and written in standard academic English. It should be free of
grammar/spelling/punctuation errors and, although this is not a research paper, should include
citations if you use any outside sources, apart from the one required above.
The paper will be due on March 12, 2020, and can be submitted through Canvas.
