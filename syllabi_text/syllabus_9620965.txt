                                    2019 Maymester (May 22 – June 10)
Course Description:
This course is designed to provide hands-on instruction for graduate and upper-level undergraduate
students in the collection and processing of marine geological and geophysical (MG&G) data. The course
will cover high-resolution air gun and streamer seismic reflection, CHIRP seismic reflection, multibeam
bathymetry, sidescan sonar, sediment coring, grab sampling and the sedimentology of resulting seabed
samples (e.g., core description, grain size analysis, x-radiography, magnetic susceptibility etc.). Scientific
and technical experts in each of the techniques will first provide students with classroom instruction.
The class will then travel to Port Aransas, Texas for 7 days of at-sea fieldwork and on-shore lab work.
Two small research vessels will be used concurrently: one for multibeam, sidescan, ADCP, and sediment
sampling and the other for multichannel seismic reflection, Chirp, and coring. Students will rotate daily
between the two vessels and onshore lab facility. Upon returning to Austin, students, working in teams
of four, will be expected to integrate and interpret data in a final project that will examine the geologic
history and/or sedimentary processes typified by this small area of the Gulf Coast continental shelf.
Students will present their interpretations formally to the class and course sponsors (private and
corporate).
