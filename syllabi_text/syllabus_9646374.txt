Extra Help: Extra TAs are available for coaching on the 5th floor of RLM. Check the bulletin
board near the coaching tables for schedule. You may also get help at the Sanger Learning
Center in the Jester Hall.
Text: Essential University Physics, 3rd Edition, Volume 1 by Richard Wolfson (older editions
are fine as well). See attached syllabus for schedule of lectures.
Overview: This is the first part of a calculus-based technical physics sequence recommended
primarily for premedical students and others in the biomedical sciences. The course covers
mechanics of solids and fluids, oscillations and waves, and heat and thermodynamics. This
course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to
equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments
you will regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-
world problems.
Administrative Issues: Please see Ms. Kelly McCoy, Undergraduate Office, RLM 5.214, 512-
471-8856, ugaffairs@physics.utexas.edu.
Course Pre- and Co-Requisites: Credit with a grade of at least C- in Mathematics 408C or
408R; or credit with a grade of at least C- in 408K or 408N and registration in 408L or 408S;
credit with a grade of at least C- or registration in Physics 117M.


Grading: Course grades will be calculated based on the weighted sum of the following:
Homework – 25%, Midterm Exams – 40%, and Final Exam – 35%. Course grades will be
determined by a class curve at the end of the semester and no prescribed cutoff values should be
assumed.
Quest: This course makes use of the web-based Quest content delivery and homework server
system maintained by the College of Natural Sciences. This service will require each student to
pay a $30 charge per course and $60 for two or more courses per semester for its use. This
charge goes toward the maintenance and operation of the resource. Please go to
http://quest.cns.utexas.edu to log in to the Quest system for this class. At some point during the
second or third week, when you log into Quest you will be asked to pay via credit card on a
secure payment site. Quest provides mandatory instructional material for this course, just as is
your textbook, etc. For payment questions, email quest.billing@cns.utexas.edu.
Homework: You will download the homework and submit your answers online at
https://quest.cns.utexas.edu. Solutions will be available online right after the due time. The
lowest two homework grades will be dropped in calculation of the course grade. Read the
students’ documentation at https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/questla/Students. You are
encouraged to work together on the homework. You must, however, submit your own work for
credit.
Midterm Exams and Final Exam: There will be three in-class midterm exams on Monday
June 17, Friday June 28, and Thursday July 11. The lowest midterm grade will be dropped in
calculation of the course grade. No makeup exam will be given. If you miss a midterm exam, it
will be the one that will be dropped. The final exam is comprehensive and mandatory and will be
held as scheduled by the Registrar’s Office. No early final exam will be given. The midterm
exams and final exam will be closed book and notes. A formula sheet will be provided to you
and calculators may be used for numerical calculations only. Academic dishonesty will not be
tolerated.
Pre-Class Reading and In-Class Activities: Before coming to class you are expected to have
read the relevant materials from the textbook for that day. The lectures will not simply
regurgitate what you have read, rather they will focus on explaining and expanding the concepts
that you may have difficulty understanding, with the help of demonstrations and example
problems.
Special Accommodations: The University of Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact
the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY.
