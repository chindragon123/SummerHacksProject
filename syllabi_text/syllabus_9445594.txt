Frank Lloyd Wright: Design/Method/Theory
INSTRUCTOR: Dr. Anthony Alofsin
TIME AND PLACE: 2:00-5:00pm. Tuesday                           Location: WMB 4.118
Course Unique Numbers: ARC 342D (00810), ARC395D (01235)                                       v1
Prerequisites
Open to students throughout the university. Upper division standing for undergraduates and
graduate enrollment for others. It is preferable to have a background in the history of modern
architecture and completion of survey courses I and II in the School of Architecture, but not
required. This course is not intended to fulfill the University’s undergraduate writing
component.
Course Format
 There are many ways to look at the history of architecture. This lecture course is intended use
the work of Frank Lloyd Wright to explore his designs, methods, and the theories supporting
them. While the course includes a broad over of Frank Lloyd Wright’s work, it focuses on
analysis of his designs and ideas. Students will obtain a familiarity with Wright's work, an
introduction to concepts of organic design, and a synthetic definition of architectural
modernism. The themes of the course will be explored through a series of analytical exercises.
Examples of organic architecture by other architects may also be considered as variation
interpretations of organic design. Requirements and evaluation may change as a function of the
availability of graders or Teaching Assistants.
Educational Objectives
Using the lens of historical inquiry into architecture, this course also intends to train students in
fundamental skills of critical thinking, writing, and speaking. It seeks to present a monographic,
analytical approach to the work of a major cultural figure and the phenomenon of modernism;
to develop effective skills of analysis through writing, oral, and visual communication; to
consider and analyze different viewpoints represented in diverse cultural and historic contexts;
and to gain a greater appreciation of the role of architecture in the formation of regional, natural
and global identity.
Evaluation
Grades will be based on three assignments(90%) and class attendance and participation (10%)
Details of assignments will be posted on the course Canvas site. In the case of group projects,
students should discuss any particular concerns about credit for work with the instructor during
the semester. Occasional quizzes may be given to test specific knowledge. Note: assignments
and lectures may change depending upon course size, support via a Teaching Assistant, or
changes by the Instructor that reflect lines of thought arising from lectures and class
discussions. Pluses and minus may be used with letter grades as permitted by University rules.


                                                                                               2
No make-ups of exams or quizzes will be given; a grade of 0 will be entered for a missed exam
that is not excused by an official dean's or physician's letter. Papers submitted late will receive
a reduction of one letter grade per day late. Attendance at all classes is required. Missing three
classes results in an automatic deduction of one letter grade.
EVALUATION CRITERIA
Establishing grades for projects of a creative nature is more complex than grading in other
academic areas. While each project contains certain quantifiable elements by which it may be
evaluated, a significant portion of each grade is derived from a broader, more subjective set of
issues: grasping the ideas and understanding of the project at hand, combined with an
appropriate process of inquiry; process: the consistent and rigorous development and testing of
ideas; resolution: the demonstration of competence, completeness, and finesse through
representation.
A student must earn a grade of C or better in order for the course to count toward the degree,
and to progress to the next studio in the School of Architecture. A grade of C- will not satisfy
degree requirements or prerequisites for the design studios that follow.
GRADE DESCRIPTIONS
A/A-                 Excellent
Project surpasses expectations in terms of inventiveness, appropriateness, visual language,
conceptual rigor, craft, and personal development. Student pursues concepts and techniques
above and beyond what is discussed in class. Project is complete on all levels.
B+/B/B-             Above Average
Project is thorough, well presented, diligently pursued, and successfully completed. Student
pursues ideas and suggestions presented in class and puts in effort to resolve required projects.
Project is complete on all levels and demonstrates potential for excellence.
C+/C                 Average
Project meets the minimum requirements. Suggestions made in class and not pursued with
dedication and rigor. Project is incomplete in one or more areas.
C-/D+/D/D-          Poor
Project is incomplete. Basic grasp of skill is lacking, visual clarity or logic of presentation are
not level-appropriate. Student does not demonstrate the required competence and knowledge
base.
F                   Fail
Project is unresolved. Minimum objectives are not met. Performance is not acceptable. Note
that this grade will be assigned when you have excessive unexcused absences.
X                Excused Incomplete
Can be given only for legitimate reasons of illness or family emergency. Simply not completing
work on time is not an adequate cause for assigning this evaluation. It may only be used after
consultation with the Associate Deans' offices and with an agreement as to a new completion


                                                                                               3
date. Work must be completed before the second week of the next semester in which you are
enrolling, according to the School of Architecture policy.
Sections:
If sections are supported for this course, small group discussions will focus on reviewing
lecture content and reading assignments. Exercises will include sections dividing into teams to
debate contrasting positions reflecting differing positions concerning architectural production
and divergent cultural viewpoints.
Assignments and Papers:
All assignments must be submitted on or before due dates. Any late assignment will be reduced
one letter grade per day of delay. The only excuse for a late assignment is illness confirmed by
a physician's letter or dean’s letter. Instructions on the format of papers will be discussed in
class and included in the course assignments folder on Canvas. Any student taking the course
credit/no-credit will receive a failing grade if he or she does not complete the course
requirements by the assigned dates. Pay special attention to instructions on the medium for
submitting your work. If hard copy printouts are required, then a digital submission is not
acceptable; sometimes both may be required. Submit papers as double-spaced single sided text
with page numbers.
Lecture etiquette:
No food or eating in class. Classes start promptly at the designated; do not arrive late as often
important announcements occur at the beginning of class.
COMPUTER USEAGE IN CLASS:
CELL PHONES AND SIMILAR DEVICES ARE NOT ALLOWED DURING
LECTURES. Texting, work on other courses, email, or anything else except careful listening
and note taking for this course is not a good use of your time and suggests that you may not
only be failing to take advantage of lectures, but you may also be distracting other students.
Please respect this course requirement. The instructor recommends that you listen, take written
notes, and after class review and revise your notes.
Special accommodations:
At the beginning of the semester, students with disabilities who need special accommodations
should notify the instructor by presenting a letter prepared by the Services for Students with
Disabilities Office. To ensure that the most appropriate accommodations can be provided,
students should contact the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259, http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/

By UT Austin policy, you must notify the instructor of your pending absence at least fourteen
days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an
examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will
be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the
absence.


                                                                                              4
