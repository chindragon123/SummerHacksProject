                                     Course Description
This course explores the history, politics and conditions of indigenous people
throughout the world. One organizing theme of the course will be the ongoing
relationships between indigenous people and their respective settler-states, relationships
that have been characterized by equal parts continuity and change. Though our primary
focus will be on Anglophone indigenous peoples in the United States, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, we will also bring in other examples
from around the globe when relevant. Our goal is to understand how indigeneity, as
both a theoretical concept and a lived experience, intersects with ideas about
sovereignty, citizenship, race, culture, gender, nationalism, colonialism and authenticity.
Students will be exposed to a range of voices, including native and non-Native writers,
scholars and activists. Course content will cover key issues and topics critical to
indigenous communities, including defining the indigenous and the Fourth World;
comparative histories of colonialism; the various forms of legal inclusion and exclusion
in the polities of indigenous people and their settler states; the relationship between
sovereignty and citizenship; the politics of indigenous political recognition and
identification; and the image of the “native other” as it is appropriated and understood
by settler-states.
                                       Requirements
    1) Weekly notes on the required reading (MAXIMUM 2 pages, single-spaced) that
        include a brief summary of the main points along with a constructive, critical
        appraisal. These reading notes are due in class on the day of the discussion. No
        late notes will be accepted, but each student may skip two sets of notes over the
        semester.
    2) Each student will lead at least one classroom discussion, for which some
        background reading is strongly recommended. The student leader must circulate
        copies of their reading notes to the rest of the class and provide a handout of
        their “talking points.”
    3) Students will prepare one research paper (20-30 pages in length), the due date of
        which is noted in the body of the syllabus.
You will be evaluated on the basis of your weekly reading notes (35%); the final research
paper (35%); and active participation in classroom presentations and discussions (30%).
This means that readings are absolutely mandatory. Since this is a seminar, students
must be prepared to exchange ideas and to respectfully engage one another in the
classroom setting.
