I. Course Overview
This course explores issues that impact human development. They are controversial in that they comprise problems
with no obvious solutions. Rather than memorizing a set of facts delivered via my lectures, students will become
familiar with the topics through their own class presentations. In the course of this analysis students should also
become more familiar with the many ways that developmental psychologists go about answering basic questions
such as: “Is nature or nurture more important for developmental outcome?”
II. Course Requirements
      •   The Psychology Department will drop all students who do not meet the following prerequisites:
          o     PSY 301 & PSY 418 (or equivalent listed in course schedule) completed with a grade of C or better
          o     Upper-division standing (60 hours completed)
      •   B. Readings: Posted in PDF format on Canvas: http://canvas.utexas.edu/
THIS COURSE WAS DESIGNED TO BE DISCUSSION-BASED.
      •   Much of your performance in the online version will be based on the interaction that you have with
          your classmates, with our TA, and with me.
      •   If feel that you will not gain anything from a course that is not a traditional lecture-style course, you
          should probably drop this one.
      •   This is NOT the kind of course that you can register for, prepare for an exam, and then go away
          again. Attending class regularly is out this time around, but you are expected to meet deadlines
          each week. The intent of these deadlines is to keep all of us engaged with our topics as we would be
          in normal times.
lll. Evaluation of Student Performance
        Class participation I: Class Discussions (on Canvas) To encourage you to interact w/your classmates
        about course material, we’ll post weekly discussion topics on Canvas through each topic’s module or through
        Assignments.
      •   A new discussion will be activated each Monday
      •   For the 4 weeks that the discussions are up and running, you are required to:
          o offer comments/responses to posted questions.
          o respond to at least one of your classmate’s posts.
      •   Your correctly posted responses earn you 3 points per Class Discussion. Of course, you are encouraged to
          read these discussions regularly and to make comments whenever you like.
      •   The people presenting on the topics for the week are also expected to post to these class discussions.
      •    In addition to offering a chance to make observations, these class discussions also ‘prod’ you to keep up
          w/course topics. This component contributes a maximum of 12 points to your total grade (3 pts. X 4 weekly
          Class Discussions).
        Class participation lI: Article Comments This type of class succeeds or fails as a result of your preparation.
        You will be expected to read our topic materials in sufficient depth to be able to participate in online class
        discussion. To motivate you to do so, you will reflect on the readings sufficiently to come up with a comment
        or a question.
      •   Plan to post an entry no later than Monday (by midnight) for the first topic of the week and Wednesday
          (also by midnight) for the second topic of the week.
             o An entry comprises 2 comments or questions – 1 from each reading (each worth 2 pts.).
      •   The exception is our first reading, State of America’s Children. There’s just 1 reading, but you’re still
          expected to post 2 comments or questions.
                                                             1


•   As with the Group Discussion Forums, you can access the Article Comments links either through the
    “Assignments” or the “Modules” areas. Each topic will have its own Article Comment link.
•   The persons presenting on an issue will also be expected to post on the readings related to their
    topics.
•   This activity offers an opportunity for me to have a 1-to-1 dialog with each of you.
•   This course component can earn you a total of 28 pts. (4 pts. X 7 issue reading sets)
•   Ground Rules for Article Comments:
       o Please indicate which paper your question or comment addresses and the page numbers for specific
            questions/comments.
       o    Since one of the purposes of the questions/comments is to encourage you to keep up with the
            reading, the questions/comments must clearly be related to the reading (Example of a poor question
            related to sex education: “So why are teenagers so stupid about sex anyway?” You could have come
            up with this question without doing any reading.)
       o    Personal reflections are fine as long as it’s clear that the reflections were stimulated by the reading.
            (“When I read about the type of information teens receive in abstinence classes, I recalled how my
            own sex ed classes….”)
       o    Clarification questions (“What is chlamydia?”) are OK, but plan on elaborating on your confusion
            (“what is chlamydia? I thought the authors were making a point about HIV, but then they introduced
            chlamydia….”). Remember that questions/comments that you would really like to talk about are
            preferred; many points of clarification can be cleared up on your own through a bit of internet
            research.
  Class participation Ill: Issue Presentations
    The Presenters: To encourage as diverse a set of perspectives as possible, we will ask you to join a group
    in presenting facets of our course topics during the semester. Guidelines will be addressed in the first week
    of classes
  •    What we want from you is very straight forward—a presentation of important concepts, some analysis of
       the topic, and some initiative in encouraging your classmates to engage in some active reflection on your
       topic. Send completed slides to: repp@austin.utexas.edu.
  •    Your slides will be made available in Canvas>Presentation>“Issue Name Presentation + Responses”
  •    The presentation is worth 16 points.
  •    Your responses to 4 comments or questions from classmates who post on your “Issue Presentation +
       Responses” earn you 4 more points (1 pt. per post with a max of 4 pts.)
  •    The presentation-related components total 20 points.
    The “Audience”: Those not presenting will have responsibilities, too. To ensure that you are engaging with
    the presenters’ information, you’re asked to:
  •    Post 4 questions or comments in response to each presentation, accessible at
       Canvas>Presentation>“Issue Name Presentation + Responses”
  •    1 pt. per post with a max of 4 pts., 4 pts X 5 presentations = 20 possible points)
  •    Complete Issue Reports
         o Issue Reports: You will complete Issue Reports for 6 topics—the sample topic (The State of
              America’s Children) plus the 5 issues that you are not presenting.
         o By midnight each Monday, Issue Reports from the previous week’s topics that you did not
              present will be due.
         o These reports simply summarize the issues associated with our topics.
         o Each issue report is worth a possible 6 points making this component of your grade total = 36
              points.
         o The report forms can be downloaded from the “Assignments” or “Modules” areas of Canvas. You
              will use the “File Upload” option. Directions can be found at:
              https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-3128
                                                         2


        Quizzes: Quizzes over the issue readings will be available on Canvas.
        •    There will be 7 of these quizzes over the issues each comprising 6 questions plus 1 extra credit question.
        •    The quizzes contribute 42 points toward your grade.
Total course points equal 158.          Points will be recorded in your grades on Canvas.
Course grades will be assigned on the basis of the percentage of the total possible points that you earn.
Course Grade                   Per Cent of Course Points
