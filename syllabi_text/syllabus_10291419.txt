Overview: The course examines financial reporting issues, mainly from a user perspective. The objectives are:
(1) To learn about current U.S. financial reporting;
(2) To understand whether and how financial reporting captures the economics of transactions and events, and;
(3) To learn how to reason about financial reporting problems as users do (i.e., to understand the relations
between financial statements, including footnotes, and journal entries).
Required Text: Financial Reporting and Analysis by Revsine et al. (7th Edition)
Communication Channels: The class webpage is Canvas. I may send email containing announcements.
Exams: There will be two exams each term, each worth 50% of your grade. Exams may include multiple-choice,
short answer and computational questions. You may have 1-page (8.5” x 11”, front/back, your own handwriting)
of notes for use during the exam, which must be turned in with your exam. Electronically prepared exam notes
will receive a LARGE penalty. Any request for a re-grade must be made IN WRITING no less than two days
and no more than seven days after the exam is returned. The request must state, IN DETAIL, the reason you
believe the grade is in error. Requests that do not conform to this policy will not be honored.
Any missed exam must be approved either in advance (by me or the program director) or through Student
Emergency Services. Makeup exams will be given, at my discretion, for exceptional circumstances. For normal
absences, the weight will be assigned to the other exam. If you have no valid reason, you will receive a grade of
zero. I reserve the right to adjust grades for extraordinary class contribution. I also reserve the right to give
(unannounced) quizzes, which will substitute for part of the exam. There will be no makeups for quizzes.
Homework: Homework (problems only) may be required to be turned in. If so, they will count for 10% of the
exam grade and will be due on exam day. Please note that the “Expected Dates” on the Detailed Schedule are just
that; only homework for topics that will be on an exam will be due for that particular exam. In other words,
homework for incomplete topics is not due.
You should work homework exercises and problems to prepare for the exam. You should NOT wait until just
before the exam to work all of them at once. Working on the homework assignments with other students is
encouraged. When homework is collected, it must be stapled, with each question clearly presented. All other
common law norms of homework apply (e.g., put your name on it). Office hours tend to be crowded right before
exams and thus keeping up with homework is to your advantage.
Curved Grades: GRADES WILL BE BASED ON A CURVE. I cannot stress enough that a curve means that
you cannot assume ANYTHING about what a score means as far as a grade. In other words, a score below 60
does not guarantee an “F.” In general, scores around 60 receive a “B,” although, again, this is not a guarantee.
Despite repeated explanations of this concept, many students make false assumptions that they are failing the
course or getting very low grades when they are (often) performing in the average range. Again, it all depends on
the distribution. While most students seem to understand the curve, there are misunderstandings EVERY semester
on this issue. The class average is generally expected to be approximately 3.4, although this may vary based on
my assessment of overall class performance. Plus/minus grading will be used. I will provide an update after the
first exam of where your score places you. This will be done IN CLASS.
Class Conduct: Professional behavior is required. In particular, please put away cell phones. If you have
unusual circumstances, speak with me about it before class. If I say nothing, this does not mean that I did not


notice it – the use of a cell phone is one of the most obvious activities to observe from the front of the room.
Please note that you may step out of the room at any time, provided you do so in a non-disruptive manner. If you
cannot live without your cell phone during class, this is not the course (or career) for you. I will impose a
substantial grade penalty for those who distract other students through cell phone use.
Class Attendance: Class attendance is important, but I do not track attendance. YOU DO NOT NEED TO
NOTIFY ME UNLESS YOUR ABSENCE WILL BE FOR AN EXTENDED TIME. Please note that if you miss
class, photocopying or scanning of that day’s notes is not a service that I provide - you may copy them (by hand)
during office hours or get a copy from a classmate.
Students with disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
