Second verse same as the first
Well, almost. You’ve done it before, now we’re going to do it again only bigger, better, and
creative...er. You’re going to come up with big ideas that don’t only work once, but multiple
times, in multiple directions, on multiple media. Your design must be better. Your execution
must be better. Your copy must be better. Your YOU must be better.
Trading books for tiny statues
While most classes require books and course packets that could cost you hundreds of dollars,
P2 mostly just costs all of your free time (and then some). However, we highly encourage you
begin setting aside money for entry, tickets, postage, etc. for work you wish to submit to
award shows. Depending on the semester, you may wish to enter several pieces of work in
anywhere from 2 to 4 award shows. For reference, the local Addy Awards usually costs
$35-$45 per entry/category, with tickets to see the show around $50 for students. So, save
those pennies.
Stand and deliver
You’ll be presenting more than simply hanging stuff up on walls, though that happens as well.
This means you’ll need a more final idea before you stand in front of the class and make a fool
of yourself. How much sleep did you think you were getting this semester? Might want to
rethink that. Half-baked ideas will not be critiqued. Bring your A game.
Final critique, take 2
As before you are expected to fully execute the best of the best ideas using all digital, manual,


bought, borrowed and stolen methods available. Unlike before, the expectation is higher. In
final critique you will show a MINIMUM of 15 pieces and a minimum of 4 campaigns. Even
more so than in P1 you’ll be working on your projects in your “free” time. Don’t underestimate
the commitment. P3 is not a given.
         NOTE: The lightnin’ round
         If you don’t show the required work in final critique you cannot earn a grade higher than
         a 80, and an 80 would mean you had a perfect book otherwise (read: not gonna
         happen). I must see and approve all portfolio work prior to the critique. I reserve the
         right to remove work shown without my approval. If I remove work and you don’t meet
         the minimum requirements you may not participate. If you can’t participate, chances are
         you’ll be saying hello to Mr. C (or even Mr. D) and goodbye to P3.
Push your pixel pushing skills. What passed for quality in P1 won’t in P2. You have to grow.
Though it’s no longer mandatory, Lynda classes and the like are highly encouraged.
Remember, advertising is subjective. There are no right answers. Do better each time and play
nice with others. The ad biz is small and incestuous. Your friends here will be your colleagues,
competitions, and cohorts. Love them. Fear them. Respect them. You’re all in this together.
                 Go buy this stuff...again (yes, that means you’re mounting work):
                 ‣ 500 sheets of white copy paper (cheap is good)
                 ‣ Black Sharpie fine-tip markers (A stack of them. They tend to get lost.)
                 ‣ 1-2 Sheets of black on black foam core board
                 ‣ A fresh X-Acto #1 knife + pack of extra blades (borrowable/shareable)
                 ‣ A metal straightedge ruler (borrowable/shareable)
                 ‣ A can or 2 of 3M Spray Mount (NOT Super 77)
                 ‣ ​TWO (2) black queen-size FLAT bed sheet (lowest thread count wins!)
Final Grades
65% = Final Portfolio (15 pieces minimum)
20% = Final Critique
15% = Participation, attitude, and professionalism
Note that there is a catalog requirement for all Advertising and PR majors to have a minimum
grade of C in all communication courses and all courses required and electives for their major. I
believe that grade is a B for graduate students.
Grades are true to form. You earn a C by being average. That means you showed up and
checked all the boxes. Impress me and get a B. If I think you could start a business with me
tomorrow you might just be gunning for an A.
How to succeed
‣ Treat this like it’s already your job.
‣ Fail big! Make mistakes and own them. We all learn from them.
‣ Play nice. Be a good partner. Seriously. Do your end and then some.
‣ Spend at ​LEAST​ 10 hours outside of class for every one hour in class. No, really. Do it.
‣ Study award shows and latest work, seek out all kinds of existing and emerging creativity,


and develop your skills. Keep your eyes open.
‣ Seek a balance. Absorb advertising and culture as much as possible but leave yourself time
for your own contributions. Remember, you’re a creative now. Create.
Legal stuff. Read it anyway.
Attendance + Late Work
You are a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry. That means you are expected to
do all of the work all of the time. That means showing up ready to present in every class. If I
decide to call on you or your partner to show me what you’re up to, you better have something
to say. If the class, as a whole, does not have work enough prepared for class then class may
just be cancelled. And trust me, you need every bit of class time you can get each semester.
Cheating
The usual university rules apply to cheating and plagiarism. When it doubt, refer to Wheaton’s
law. If you are caught doing either, you will automatically fail this course. Please familiarize
yourself with the university’s policy on plagiarism​ ​here.
Moving on to P3
To move forward in the highly competitive Texas Creative sequence, you must earn at least a
“B-” in this class (79.5% or higher) to be eligible for admission to Portfolio 3. Earning a “B-” or
better DOES NOT guarantee your progression. Evidence of exceptional work, mastery of
concepts, growth from previous semesters, and professionalism is also required.
E-Mail and Canvas
In this course, email and Canvas will both be used to communicate. I’m very reachable on my
email. So you will be as well. Make sure your Canvas email is updated to a current, reachable
account. You will be responsible for checking it regularly for class work and announcements.
It’s tough out there
The world is a little more stressful than usual lately. So, if stress, test anxiety, racing thoughts,
feeling unmotivated or anything else is getting in your way, UT has options available for
support. Our CARE Counselor in the Moody College of Communication is:
