COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course is the culmination of your undergraduate engineering education. To be enrolled in this course, you must
have completed all core courses in the BSME degree curriculum, excluding one or more technical area block
courses. As part of a three- or four-member student team, you will apply your engineering skills to a design project,
with the guidance and advice of faculty members. Many of these projects are sponsored by industry, while others are
proposed by faculty members. All projects represent current areas of concern to the sponsors, who frequently
implement the students’ design solutions.
A core requirement of this course is application of engineering design methodology to solve the problem. This
means that each student team must follow a systematic approach, employing both engineering analysis and
synthesis, throughout the design project.
ME Program Outcomes:
The faculty of the Department of Mechanical Engineering has established 10 Program Outcomes that define the
basic skills and abilities that each graduate of the department will successfully acquire. Each course in the
curriculum is designed to address one or more of these Program Outcomes. Demonstration of the following
outcomes is expected of each student who successfully completes MEw266K/MEw266P:
1.   Knowledge of and ability to apply engineering and science fundamentals to real problems.
2.   Ability to formulate and solve open-ended problems.
3.   Ability to design mechanical components, systems, and processes.
4.   Ability to set up, conduct and interpret experiments, and to present the results in a professional manner.
5.   Ability to use modern computer tools in mechanical engineering.
6.   Ability to communicate in written, oral and graphical forms.
7.   Ability to work in teams and apply interpersonal skills in engineering contexts.
Course-specific objectives:
Each student who successfully completes this course will demonstrate the ability to:
1.   Work in a team to solve a significant, open-ended engineering problem.
2.   Combine structured design methods and techniques into an appropriate design process.
3.   Apply project management techniques throughout all stages of a design project.
4.   Apply task clarification techniques to identify and clearly state an engineering problem, or apply root cause
     analysis to identify the sources of an engineering or technical problem.
5.   Generate alternative solutions to an engineering problem.
6.   Make engineering decisions using QUANTITATIVE techniques.
7.   Apply appropriate engineering analysis to predict performance and develop details of solutions to engineering
     problems, or develop and perform experiments, analyze the resulting data, and draw correct conclusions about
     the data Carrying out detailed engineering analysis is one of the most important objectives of this course.
     Note that “tinkering” to get a prototype to work without sound engineering predictions does not fulfill this
     objective.
8.   Communicate engineering information in graphical, oral, and written forms.
In addition, each student must be knowledgeable about:
1.   Engineering professionalism and ethics.
2.   Product and engineering liability.
3.   Safety considerations and obligations for protection of life, health, and property.
4.   Other considerations important to the professional engineer.

COURSE STRUCTURE
1. Three-hour LECTURES (MEw266K) are presented at selected times throughout the semester to introduce
    material of broad interest and value to students engaged in engineering design projects. Lectures will be held
    during the first three weeks of the semester, the week after the scheduled oral design review, and once before
    and once after the final presentations.
2.  Scheduled LABORATORY SECTIONS (MEw266P) meet two times a week for 2 ½ hours at a time to allow
    teaching assistants to supervise and monitor each project closely.
    LABORATORY GROUPS include teams of three or four persons each. Each team receives a different project
    assignment (the team’s stated preferences are considered as much as possible). Student teams schedule regular
    meeting times with their TA during the laboratory time. Teams usually visit the sponsoring institution’s
    facilities to define the design problem clearly and become acquainted with the sponsor representative.
3.  ATTENDANCE is required by all students at all scheduled lectures and laboratories.
4.  Each team is required to have a FACULTY ADVISOR. The team is expected to work with their Faculty
    Advisor throughout the semester.
5.  Each team will produce a series of reports and presentations as the semester progresses, culminating in a final
    WRITTEN REPORT. Grades on the final report will focus on quality and completeness rather than on
    quantity and effort alone. Sponsor and faculty advisor feedback will be used to determine final grades.
    Dr. Crawford grades the final written report. The student manual has a sample final report grading sheet.
    A FINAL ORAL PRESENTATION is given to the sponsors, faculty, and Mechanical Engineering students.
    The presentations are graded by the entire MEw266K teaching staff. The student manual has a sample oral
    presentation grading-sheet. The final presentation and final report take the place of a final exam.

As the table shows, 75% of your grade is based on the final oral presentation, the final written report, and the project
notebook. Also, 50% of the final written report (20% of the total points for the course) is based on the quality of the
design solution. Thus, the four most important factors in determining your final grade are:
    1.    The quality of the design solution;
    2.    The quality of the final written report;
    3.    The quality of the final oral presentation; and
    4.    The quality of your project notebook.
Final grades for the class are assigned on the plus/minus (+/-) grading system according to the following scale:
                                                      91-100    A
                                                      90        A-
                                                      89        B+
                                                      81-88     B

The following considerations may result in grade adjustments:
1.  GRADES FOR INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS may be adjusted up or down to account for differences in
    performance of individual members of a design team, based on peer evaluations and evaluations by TAs.
2.  LECTURE ABSENCES may result in modification of an individual student’s final grade.
3.  FAILURE TO WORK WITH YOUR FACULTY ADVISOR OR SPONSOR will result in a significant
    grade reduction.
COURSE GUIDELINES
1. TEXT: None. Course materials are provided via the course's Canvas site (http://canvas.utexas.edu/).
2.    DESIGN NOTEBOOK: Each team member will use the provided Google Docs notebook template to record
      design notes, meeting notes, Gantt charts, sketches, calculations, research and patent information, experimental
      data, and related items pertaining to the project. You should create and use a "UTmail" (Google for Edu)
      account to store your notebook file in your associated UTmail Google Drive instance. The TA periodically
      reviews the notebooks—you will export your current notebook as a pdf and upload it to the appropriate Canvas
      assignment (NotebookCheck1, NotebookCheck2, NotebookFinal). At the end of the semester, each student
      will also include their notebook pdf in the team's UT Box folder which you share to your sponsor.
3.    DEADLINES for the required reports and oral presentations determine the pace of the course. Each student
      receives a course schedule (inside the front cover of the bluebook) that lists all deadlines for submission of
      individual and team reports. Grade deductions may result for any work received after the specified deadline (if
      the work is accepted). There will be no deadline extensions.
4.    The UNIVERSITY WRITING CENTER (http://uwc.utexas.edu/) provides free writing assistance for any
      UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis. The UWC is located on the second floor of the Perry
