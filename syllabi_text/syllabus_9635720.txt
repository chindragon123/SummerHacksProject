OFFICE HOURS
M/W 3PM- 4PM: Please email me to arrange an appointment, if possible.
If you cannot make this time, you can email me to arrange alternative times.
Text Books:          Genetics (From Genes to Genomes); 6th edition by Hartwell et al.
Leland Hartwell and colleagues have written a superb genetics textbook, now in its 6th edition.
It is lively, current, weaves in the new and exciting frontier of genomics and systems biology.
(5th edition allowed)
Additional materials:
I will provide either URL link for the on-line material (I will use some on-line textbooks, which are
free of charge; and some other web resources) or pdf files for any additional material that I
will cover in the class.
Synopsis:
Learning genetics is usually very time-consuming! Genetics has earned a reputation as a
stumbling block to some students at universities all over the world. There are several
reasons for this. One of the most important reasons is that doing well in a Genetics class
requires very different skills than doing well in an anatomy class or a microbiology class.
Analytical thinking is the most important skill necessary for understanding genetics.
Memorization skills will help you, but you will have to really understand the material to do
well in Genetics class. Best way to improve your analytical skill is to practice as many problems
as possible. That’s why I encourage you to work on problems (before class/ in-class quizzes,
homework, Learnsmart and etc.)
Lectures & Readings:
Lecture handouts will be posted on Canvas by 6pm the evening prior to the corresponding lecture.
Lecture handouts are drafts until given, and perhaps a little afterwards (they can be revised at
any time). Each week (lectures), you will be given corresponding chapters in the textbook (see
schedule). I will try to stay with the textbook. But from time to time, I will use material from other
sources. Additional readings from the literature or available on the internet may be assigned
and will be made available through Canvas.
Correspondence: All announcements/scores/answers/ will be made available through Canvas.
So check the site often. I will also use group email through Canvas. So please make sure
that your official University email address is an address at which you actually read mail.
Attendance:
There will be “in-class” quizzes using Squarecap (https://squarecap.com/), which will be used for
your grade (see below for grading policy). Squarecap quizzes will be given anytime during the
class. Participation will be counted toward your grade (not for correct answer). If you do
not attend (or do not answer), you will lose 5 points. There will be a trial-period during first
two classes.
Discussion Sections: Attendance at discussion section is not required but it would help you
keep up with material that we cover during class and in your reading. A total of 10 extra points
can be earned for quizzes or problems assigned during discussion section. (Note the change
on course number you may have)
85025 M.W 11:30 am – 1:00 pm; PHR 2.116
85035 MW 1:00 pm -2:30 pm; GDC 5.304
Discussion section will begin on June. 10


Periodic “on your own” quizzes
I will periodically post quizzes on Canvas for you to work on. You will have 48 hours to
submit your answers. Questions are designed to review material from the previous lectures or
to review basic knowledge for upcoming lectures. Participation/scores will be counted toward
your grade. You need to get at least 50% correct answers to get credit. If you do not
participate or get less than 50%, you will lose 5 points. It is a good idea to review what you
know and what you do not know through this quiz series. And make sure that you understand
concept related with questions.
Pop-up Quiz & Group Activities:
In-class quizzes (paper quizzes) and/or Group activities will be given anytime during the class.
Scores you earned from quizzes and group activities are extra points that will be used to
calculate your final grade!
Homework:
Homework will be assigned 48 hours before the due date. The idea of assigning homework is
to help you learn the material. There will be 4 homework assignments. Late homework will not
be accepted. Homework should be turned in by 5:00 pm on due date. You are encouraged to
work together for homework, but you should come up with your own answer (copied answers
will not be graded). Handwriting is required. No word file will be accepted.
Formal Exams:
There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. The final exam will emphasize the
material since the midterm, but will also include topics from earlier in the semester. Each
exam will have a maximum score 105 points (5 points from extra credit questions).
There will be no makeup exams. If you cannot take exams on scheduled date/time, you
should not take this class. It is your responsibility to arrive at exams on time. Students who
arrive late will not be given additional time.
Midterm exam: Wednesday, June 24, 10:00 am – 11:30 am
Final exam schedule: Friday, Jul 12, 10:00 am – 11:30 am
Previous exams will also be posted on Canvas which will be helpful to be familiar with questions.
Note that course schedule has been changed from previous years, thus coverage of old tests are
different from current ones.

Following grade scales are “guaranteed”: Therefore, it is possible that all of you get “A” if you
do well.
  A     465-500 + α points                 C+     355-374 points
  A-    440-455 points                     C      335-354 points
  B+    415-439 points                     C-     325-334 points
  B     390-414 points                     D      275-324 points
  B-    375-389 points                     F      ≤ 274 points
Cut-offs can be lower (but will not be higher) depending on overall performance of the class.
