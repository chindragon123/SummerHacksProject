Textbook: Elementary Number Theory and Its Application, 6th edition, by Kenneth H. Rosen.
Prerequisites and degree relevance: M341 or M325K, with a grade of at least C-. This is
a first course that emphasizes understanding and creating proofs; therefore, it must provide a
transition from the problem-solving approach of calculus to the entirely rigorous approach of
advanced courses such as M365C or M373K.
Homework: There will be homework assignments due on Tuesdays and Fridays. Late home-
work will not be accepted for any reason. If you are not in class on Tuesday or Friday, you
can turn in your homework earlier (either in class or during office hours only), but not later.
Electronic submissions will not be accepted. One lowest homework score will be dropped at
the end of the semester.
Exams: There will a 75 min. in-class midterm exam (Wed, June 26) and the final exam
(Fri, July 12, 9:00am-12:00pm in RLM 7.104). A makeup will be given only if you miss a test
because of a university sponsored event or a documented medical excuse. Class notes, books,
cell phones, calculators and other aids will not be allowed.
Grading and Attendance: To compute your final course grade, I will average your homework
(20%), the midterm exam (35%) and the final exam (45%). Class attendance will be taken at
the beginning of each class and will contribute towards your final grade. An absence cannot be
excused for any reason. One lowest attendance score will be dropped at the end of the semester.
The cut-off numbers for grades will be:
