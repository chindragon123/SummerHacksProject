Course Description
This 1-hour course aims to maintain and enhance students’ understanding of Modern
Standard Arabic (fuṣḥa) grammar, while also building vocabulary and improving
reading/writing skills. Homework will include textbook readings, grammatical analysis,
translation between English and Arabic, sentence composition, and glossary-building.
Assessments will include weekly quizzes.
        Major grammatical topics covered in this course are the following: the imperfect verb
in indicative, subjunctive, jussive, and imperative moods; negation of perfect and imperfect
verbs; passive verbs; derived verb forms I through X; and doubled verbs. Several minor topics
will be covered as well.
        Prerequisites for this course are 3rd semester Arabic or equivalent. Arabic Grammar I
is strongly recommended. The term will begin with a two-week review period and testing on
grammatical concepts and vocabulary from Chapters 2 through 13 of the textbook, which were
covered in Arabic Grammar I. Students who enroll in this course without having taken Arabic
Grammar I are strongly encouraged to begin study of those chapters prior to the start of the
term.
        This course is open to graduate student auditors, with permission of instructor.
Course Materials
• Select chapters from J. A. Haywood and H. M. Nahmad, A New Arabic Grammar of the
Written Language. Serious students of Arabic are encouraged to purchase this textbook, if
possible, although excerpts for this course will be available on Canvas.
• The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic, ed. J. M. Cowan, any edition
(including online or electronic formats). This dictionary is required for class, as it is arranged
by root. Online translators are not acceptable.

Attendance, Preparedness and Participation
• This class only meets once a week, so attendance at every session is required. If you miss
class, you will lose the attendance/participation point for that day; you must find a way to
submit your written homework to me as soon as possible as well as make up the quiz.
• You are expected to be prepared for each week’s session. Expect to be called on in class, such


as to recite/read aloud, answers questions, etc.
Homework
• You will need highlighters for your homework: yellow, pink, blue, and green.
• Homework must be submitted at the end of the class period that it is due.
• Homework must be handwritten, neatly, in pen, on standard loose-leaf lined paper, right-
to-left.
• Homework must be organized in the same order as in the textbook, and the title and page
number of the exercise must appear above each answer set. Only one answer per line. Each
answer must be numbered.
• Each homework assignment must include a heading, including the following: your name,
assignment chapter, assignment number, and submission date.
• If your homework takes more than one page, it must be stapled. (No tape, no bent corners,
etc.)
• All Arabic homework must include full vocalization (taskhkīl, voweling).
• Homework will primarily be graded on completeness, timeliness, and adherence to format
rules described here.
• Be prepared to share your homework with other students for grading/correction, and also to
read answers aloud.
IMPORTANT: Tackling the Material
• Read each chapter carefully. Make sure you understand every point.
• Learn all vocabulary introduced in each chapter. Do as follows:
- Group words into nouns, adjectives, verbs, prepositions, adverbs, and particles. Learn words
in their groups.
- Use the five “senses” of language learning: speaking, listening, reading, writing, imagining.
• Test your passive recall and your active recall of vocabulary.
