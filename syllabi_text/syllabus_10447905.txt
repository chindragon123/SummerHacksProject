GSDF311C: The Movies Go to War, From World War II to Desert Storm
SYLLABUS: SHORT (5-WEEK) SUMMER SESSION
GSDF311C/AMSF315C/CLF305/EUSF307 (Unique numbers
80583/78398/79364/79924)
Instructor: Sabine Waas
    This course will introduce some of the most famous war films, and some less familiar
ones, from the US and Europe-- from The Longest Day through Saving Private Ryan
and Jarhead. Each war has developed its own kinds of war movies, from World Wars I
and II, through the Korean police action, and the Vietnam conflict.
    The class will engage war films as part of national history-making, and so it will
introduce how to “read” films as part of cultural history and think critically about their
content. Scenes from each war will be compared to the "real history" behind the film, to
pose questions about how history can be written and rewritten in films, and how they
might affect individual and group memory.
    Take a trip through cinematic battlefields, to see how films have helped their
audiences think about the roles of the world's superpowers in world contexts!
    Topics to be addressed include:
    • cultural stereotypes of heroes, villains, and victims
    • different countries and their takes on the same war experience
    • the politics of war films
    • rewriting history through war movies (cultural memory and post-memory)
    • documentary, docu-drama
    • how to read point of view and national ideologies out of movies.
BY THE END OF THE SEMESTER, you will be able to:
    • explain the rough contours of significant 20th-century military conflicts
    • understand the role that representation plays in making histories plausible to
         audiences
    • compare/contrast films from different national sites and made for different
         audiences, seeing how “editing” the facts of history is used to created national
         ideologies of victory and victim-hood around historical events, and
    • argue cases using film evidence — how to talk about what you see in historical
         context, and how to tie pictures to history/words
GRADING AND ASSIGNMENTS: OVERVIEW
         • Online quizzes: 8 total, 20 minutes each = 30% of final grade
                 o accessed through the "Quiz" link on Canvas
                 o four on history; four on the films discussed
                 o may only be logged into once -- if you click it, your timer starts, and
                    that's it (contact the TA for genuine technical issues for a possible
                    retake)
                 o contain mostly T/F, matching, and multiple choice items; based on
                    facts from readings (Goff, film plots, ppts) and clips viewed for daily
                    assignments.
                 o lowest two grades will be dropped in calculating the final class grade
         • Film Worksheets (Précis) = 4 x 10 % = 40 % of final grade (see details
             below)


              o   A précis ('pray-see) is an assignment grid that helps you make an
                  informed and consistent analysis of a text (book or film).
              o You will have to turn in FOUR one-page précis worksheets in the
                  course of the class, each of which you will start in group work done in
                  in-class (synchronous) break-out sessions in ZOOM.
              o The worksheets are available under FILES in CANVAS in their own
                  subfile, labeled and with due dates listed in the syllabus. Remember
                  to re-label them as noted above BEFORE you turn them in.
              o You may turn in the first TWO of the four working with a partner: two
                  authors on a single worksheet, with both names indicated at the top.
                  If you do it that way, label the file with your TWO LASTNAMES.
      •    Online Final = 30 % of final grade (essay format; one-time login for a two-
           hour slot that will be available after the last class day and through the official
           exam time set by UT (noted on syllabus)
              o The final will be a 2-hour essay examination administered online
                  through CANVAS, as above. It must be taken in one sitting from login
                  through final writing. You will have a choice of questions, and it will
                  be assumed that you will write for about an hour.
              o A "correct" answer must necessarily include a bibliographic entry on
                  any film it refers to (as in a précis header); answers that use as
                  examples only those clips shown in class will lose points -- you are
                  expected to draw in other examples from films you have seen.
IMPORTANT REMINDERS ON HOW TO USE THIS SYLLABUS:
   • *All readings are from Richard Goff, et al., The Twentieth Century and Beyond (pdf on
      CANVAS); texts marked READ = correlate with the day's ppt and may feature on the
      quiz on that topic
   • "REC" = readings that will help you make sense of the wars, but are not compulsory.
   • All FILMS available at Box links (indicated in the ANNOUNCEMENTS on CANVAS) as
      explained in first day PPT; sections specified on the syllabus as WATCH sections are
      fair game for the quiz on that topic, as are the basic details of plot and character that you
      should be looking up and reading on Wikipedia as linked to this syllabus.
   • All other assignments are either detailed on the syllabus or the assignments handout;
      electronic copies in the Canvas Files Link
   • Each class day has its own learning goals: what you should know or be able to do by
      the end of reading/viewing assigned materials
   • If there is a quiz for the day, it is indicated on the syllabus, along with its topic.
   • Every Class has a PPT in Canvas to complement /amplify the reading/listening goals. In
      some cases, there may be a few additional notes in a word document.

                  audiences, who all believe in the story of "The Good War" and that they
                  saved democracy in the world.

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
         The University of Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact
the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY. Any student with a
documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact the
Service for Students with Disabilities as soon as given to your TAs to receive
accommodations. You must be registered with the Students with Disabilities Services to
request any accommodations for tests, assignments, or other assistance and work with
that office to arrange them with your instructors. See:
<http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/index.php>.
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS AND OTHER ABSENCES
    • By UT Austin policy, you must notify the instructor and TA of your pending
         absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy
         day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in
         order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to
         complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
    • The same applies to official university obligations like Club or Varsity sports,
         which usually provide documentation of planned away games at the start of each
         semester.
    • Documentation from a physician is required for medical absence; arrangements
         for work to be made up must be made promptly.
    • In no case should the work be completed more than 2 weeks after the absence.
    • Other absences (e.g. family events) must be arranged for at least TWO WEEKS
         IN ADVANCE and missed work must be turned in at the NEXT CLASS SESSION
         after the one you missed. Submission before you leave is of course encouraged.
CHEATING AND PLAGIARISM
         All students fall under the UT Honor Code:
                 The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning,
                 discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility.
                 Each member of the University is expected to uphold these values
                 through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
                 community.
                                           < http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi09-10/ch01
                                  />


        Cheating and other forms of scholastic dishonesty, including plagiarism, will be
reported to the Dean of Students. Cheating on tests or plagiarism on papers will mean
an F for the assignment, with no makeup possible. If you engage in any form of
scholastic dishonesty more than once, you will receive an automatic F for the course.
        If you are unsure about the exact definition of scholastic dishonesty, you
should consult the information about academic integrity produced by the Dean of
Students Office: <http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php>.
        Plagiarism means using words or ideas that are not your own without citing your
sources and without indicating explicitly what you have taken from those sources. If you
are unsure about what constitutes plagiarism, consult:
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/plagiarism/>.
        See the UT Honor Code or an additional explanation or example of what
constitutes plagiarism ( http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi09-10/ch01/index.html).
        What does "citing your sources" mean? It means providing appropriate
footnotes and bibliographic entries. See
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/citations/>. To make
correct citations, researchers often use bibliographic software like UT's "Noodlebib"
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/noodlebib/> or Zotero <http://www.zotero.com>. The PCL
Library offers free classes on how to you them at the start of every semester. Sign up
now.

Q DROP POLICY AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT DATES
        • Texas law limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six.
            Senate Bill 1231 says:
                 Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher
                 education may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than
                 six dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has dropped
                 at another institution of higher institution of higher education, unless the
                 student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.
        •   Note that the dates for dropping courses and changing grades are indicated
            in the University Academic Calendar: < http://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars/
            >. You are responsible for these dates; instructors have NO control over
            them.
