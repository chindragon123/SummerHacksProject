Course Description:
This course is an introduction to the philosophy of medicine with a focus on social policy and ethical issues.
Topics covered include: conceptual and normative foundations of medicine; ethical implications of recent
scientific results such as genomics and human embryology; medical explications of race and their implications
for health; prospects and problems with human genetic modification and the possibility of eugenics; issues
of equity and justice in public health including genetic screening and testing, and mandatory vaccination.
Throughout, the emphasis will be on social context and normative analysis.
The course will focus on the following four major topics in sequence:
    • Ethics and human embryology.
    • Race and medicine.
    • Vaccination and problems of public health.
    • Gene cloning, editing, and eugenics.
The scope of this course is broader than that of traditional courses in biomedical ethics. It includes discussions
of topics in medical epistemology (including aspects of the philosophy of biology) and the social and political
contexts of medical practice.
Prerequisites: None, but students are expected to be willing to satisfy ambitious reading requirements
(which must be completed before each class) and to participate meaningfully in class discussions and other
course-related activities.
Class Policies and Conduct:
Students with disabilities will be accommodated as specified in: http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/
accommodations-and-services/.
For the university policy on academic honesty, look at: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/
academicintegrity.php.
Besides the usual university policies this course will implement the following rules:
   1. Attendance at all lectures and discussion sessions is mandatory and will be recorded. Poor attendance
      may lead to a failing grade independent of other aspects of course performance.
   2. Students are not allowed to use computers or any other electronic device in class or in discussion
      sessions. The purpose of this policy is to ensure a focus on class activities. Failure to comply with this
      policy may lead to a failing grade independent of other aspects of course performance.
                                                         1


   3. In all written work, sources of all information must be explicitly cited, and the sources used must
      consist of peer-reviewed publications. Using websites as information sources for citation purposes will
      not be adequate. (The internet can be profitably used to uncover information but all such information
      must be verified by reference to the peer–reviewed published literature.)
Required Texts:
The following three books are available through the University Co-op:
    • Gilbert, S. F. and Pinto-Correia. 2017. Fear, Wonder, and Science in the New Age of Reproductive
      Biotechnology. New York: Columbia University Press.
    • Hotez, P. J. 2018. Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University
      Press.
    • Fish, J. M. Ed. 2011. Race and Intelligence: Separating Science From Myth. New York: Routledge.
Other required texts are available through Canvas. Additional (optional) recommended readings are also
available at the same location. The additional readings will be of particular use when writing the term paper
(see below).
Grading Policy:
Grades will be assigned on the basis of:
    • Three open-book in-class examinations which will consist of short-answer questions, together worth
      45 % of the grade. Dates of examinations: in-class, 17-June-19; 28-June-19; and 11-July-19. The
      examinations will test knowledge of material presented in the lectures as well as in the required readings
      but not in the recommended readings.
    • A 3000-word typed term paper, worth 40 % of the grade, due in class on11-July-19. Late papers will
      not be accepted. See the Class Policies section about how to cite sources in papers. A list of potential
      paper topics will be made available through Canvas. Students are encouraged to devise their own paper
      topics but these must be explicitly discussed and cleared with the instructor prior to submission. Paper
      topics may also be generated from collective class projects that will be discussed during the lectures.
      Each such project will involve four to six students working together on a single topic and then each
      reporting on some aspect of it in an independent paper.
    • Class participation (worth 15 % of the grade) judged on the basis of attendance, active engagement
      during class meetings, and other class activities.
