Course overview
The increasing use of computers in everyday life has had a profound influence on the way we
communicate. In this class, we will explore the fundamentals of how computers represent, process, and
organize linguistic data. The course will be split into five main modules:
  1. Encoding Language: binary representations, writing systems, text data, speech data
  2. Working with Words: parts of speech, regular expressions, text normalization
  3. Building Sentences: n-gram language modeling, context-free grammars, shift-reduce parsing
  4. Classification and Analysis: topic modeling, binary classification, sentiment analysis,
  5. Big Data Revolution: perceptrons, neural networks, machine translation
 At the end of this course, all students should be able to:
  • Understand how language is represented on computers
  • Use math and statistics to explore language
  • Describe how natural language processing applications work at a high level
  • Use quantitative analysis of language to improve arguments
  • Be comfortable reading and discussing basic algorithms for computational methods
  • Be comfortable read basic mathematical equations found in some scholarly articles
  • Discuss how linguistic data can be used to solve real-world problems
Note: there is no programming in this class. While I will expect assignments and essays to be complete
digitally.
Daily "Class" Expectations
Since this is a summer course and online, it will be done a little differently than we would if it were in
person. I will be on zoom from 2:30 to 4:00 each day I expect each day to look something like the
following:
       2:30-3:00 Watch pre-recorded lecture on your own
       3:00-3:30 Discuss lecture and/or work through an example together
       3:30-4:00 Work on lecture exercises in small groups using breakout rooms
The exercises will be designed to be completed mostly 'in class' (i.e., if we have half an hour lecture, you
should be able to finish in about an hour). You are not required to attend class 'live'; however, I do not
plan to record the part of the class in which we work on exercises as I want people to feel comfortable
talking. These exercises will be 'due’ 24 hours after that class begins.


Canvas
This course will be completely run through canvas. Additionally, I use Canvas to post assignments,
grades, and readings. I will use the Canvas announcement system to communicate with the class so that
they can all be found in one place. Make sure that you either log in to check regularly or update your
preferences to receive an email for every announcement.
Zoom
You must login to zoom through canvas or the UT portal. You can log into the portal on your browser
here: https://utexas.zoom.us/. For more information about signing in through an application, see the
directions here: https://zoom.its.utexas.edu/signing-in-and-out-zoom. Additionally, please be sure to
read through the zoom info sheet found in the modules.
Email and Announcements
You must regularly check your university email, ideally at least once a day. Please use my email address,
listed on the top of the syllabus, to contact me instead of the Canvas email system, which is unreliable. I
answer emails in a timely fashion (24 hours during the week, 48 hours on the weekends), but do not
expect an immediate response. If I do not respond in the timeframe above, please feel free to send me
another email reminding me!
Office Hours
Office hours will be by appointment only. Please sign up for an appointment here:

resources that you might want to reference during class.
   • Math symbols and what they mean
   • Bases
   • Exponents
   • Probabilities
Additional readings/media will be provided on Canvas.


Course requirements and grading policy
This course will have three major components
   • Daily Exercises (20%)
   • 5 Assignments (50%)
   • 2 Exams (30%)
Daily Exercises (20%)
Lecture exercises will be assigned for each pre-recorded lecture. These exercises should be short enough
to complete 'in class' and will be based on that day's pre-recorded lecture(s). The exercises must be
completed within 24 hours of the beginning of that class period. They will mostly consist of technical
problems, which include calculations and application of algorithms, as well as matching, multiple choice,
and true-false problems. You will not be required to show any work.
The exercises will be auto-graded by canvas, and I do not plan to give personal feedback on these
exercises. Please reach out if you think there was an error in the auto-grader!
Module Assignments (50%)
For each of the five main modules, there will be one more analytical assignment. The assignments will
be released at the beginning of a module and will be due at the end (specific deadlines to be released).
The assignments will consist of two types of questions:
   • Short answer: an explanation of algorithms and methodologies, definitions of concepts,
       hypothetical examples (150-300 words)
   • Argumentation: short essays that use linguistic data to argue a point (~500 words).
I may ask to anonymously share your answers with the class (and potentially future classes). I will not
share anything without your express permission, and it is your right to decline if I ask. I see this as a way
to share interesting ideas and opinions as we will not be in a traditional classroom.
Exams (30%)
There will be two exams. The first exam will cover the first three modules (encoding, words, sentences),
the second exam will cover the last two modules (analysis, big data). We will not have an exam on NLP
applications. The exams will have questions similar to the in-class exercises and module assignments.
Grades
Final grades will be determined by the following schema.
             A: ≥93.00% A-: 92.99%-90.00%
             B+: 89.99%-87.00% B: 89.99%-87.00% B-: 89.99%-87.00%
             C+ 89.99%-87.00% C: 76.99%-73.00% C-: 72.99%-70.00%
             D+ 69.99%-67.00% D: 69.99%-67.00% D-: 62.99%-60.00%
             F: <60.00%
I do not plan to round grades.

Quantitative Reasoning
This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to
equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments you will
regularly encounter in your adult and professional life. You should, therefore, expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
Statement on Personal Pronouns
Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name, unless they have added a
"preferred name" with the Gender and Sexuality Center
(http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-resources/). I will gladly honor your
request to address you by a different name and by the gender pronouns you prefer (she/he/they/ze,
etc.). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may update my records.
Statement on Learning Success
Your success in this class is important to me. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from
learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we'll develop strategies to
meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the
student resources available through UT. Many
are listed on this syllabus, but I am happy to connect you with a person or center if you would like.
Documented Disability Statement
UT Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with
disabilities. For more information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at 512-471-6259
(voice) or 512-410-6644 (video phone) or ssd@austin.utexas.edu, or see
http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability. Faculty are not required to provide accommodations without an
official accommodation letter from SSD.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least 14 days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class or assignment in order to observe a religious
holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the
absence.
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual harassment,
sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational
institutions. Faculty members and certain staff members, including myself, are considered "Responsible
Employees" or "Mandatory Reporters", which means that they are required to report any Title IX related
incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one to the Title IX coordinator. If you want
to speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university,
email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources, visit
titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.


Q Drop Policy:
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six
(6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231: "Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher
education may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including
any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student
shows good cause for dropping more than that number."
