Made in Germany, Grown in the US:
When Scholars Turn Exiles
Fall 2019:
Instructor: Katherine Arens (arens@austin.utexas.edu>
        FLAGS: Global Culture, Ethics and Leadership
        German-speaking scholars and professionals lost their worlds because of the
20th century's two great European Wars, but Europe's loss was the US's gain. From
philosophers, psychoanalysts, and sociologists through theorists of art, film, and power -
- between the end of the First World War (1918) and the aftermath of the Second World
Warm these scholars and professionals at the top of their intellectual games were
displaced, deported, or sent into exile on a diasporic course. No small number of them
ended in the US.
        This course will combine history with the study of disciplinary philosophies in
order to pursue the problem of what forced intellectual migration can imply for the
disciplines to which these scholars belonged. What is the responsibility, for example, of
a scholar like Adorno when he brings a study from Weimar Germany and uses it to help
support the myth of Hitler as a father figure, or like Siegfried Kracauer, who theorizes
representations of the "mass ornament" in films to write From Caligari to Hitler, or of
Heidegger's followers who refuse to look Nazi complicity in the face? Or, looking back to
WW I, what it meant to claim your work as the product of a national school of thought,
when the nation that It purportedly belonged to did not exist before 1918 and had not
educated or sponsored you?
        In pursuing these examples, students will learn not only new ways of reading
philosophy and theories that were central to the 20th century and remain viable today,
but also how to evaluate the costs for individuals caught between history, exile, and
intellectual work.
        TRIGGER WARNING: This course necessarily rests on the facts of the National
        Socialist (Nazi) government of Germany under Hitler. Many of the texts allude to,
        exemplify, or show photographs of acts of genocide, murder, torture, theft /
        misappropriation of personal property, systematic discrimination and oppression, crimes
        against law and humanity, and what we today call hate speech. Every attempt will be
        made to minimize gratuitous use of disturbing images, but they cannot be entirely
        avoided; if you cannot confront such representations, please consider dropping the
        course because the instructor cannot, in this case, find alternate readings.
Grading:
        • 3 précis (synthetic précis) situating texts into historical context to address the covert
            ethical / evaluative assumptions of their presentations = 3 x 5% of course grades =
            15 % of grade (two done in pairs)
        • 1 short essay (3-5 pp.) applying Jaspers' idea of guilt to analyzing another text as
            representing an ethical problem = 25 % of Grade


      •    1 essay (final project) for the defense or prosecution of an ethics trial: combining
           research in the history and situation of a particular text with a reading of the text's
           contents, to make a systematic case for or against its overt or covet ethical claims.
           The project will be done in phases:
              o 10% of grade= abstract/proposal,
              o 20 % for bibliography and "history of" section (the exposition of the facts, in 5
                   pp or less, not counting bibliography), and
              o 30% for the final essay presenting a case (ca. 10 pages).

• Ethics and Leadership Flag: Ethics and Leadership courses are designed to equip you with skills
  that are necessary for making ethical decisions in your adult and professional life. You should
  therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments involving ethical
  issues and the process of applying ethical reasoning to real-life situations.
• Global Cultures Flag: Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your familiarity with cultural
  groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to
  come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural
  group, past or present.

       READ:
               • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I
               • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II
               • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth
       LECTURE BACKGROUND (if you are interested):
             Goff, Chapters 7 & 8 (WW I); 11 (has migrants), 16 (Hitler), parts of 17, 18
       READING GOAL / CLASS DISCUSSION: Europe's two World Wars disrupted
             traditions fatally, aside from the damage in infrastructure and the losses in life (WW
             I actually had a percentage-wise larger loss of life in the west, though WW II had
             larger numbers of lost and killed). Come in with ideas about what challenges have
             been introduced into academic disciplines and social organizations; have at least
             two distinct ones for each war. The class will focus on the impacts of the wars (and


            the major referent points for Germany), differentiating the positions of intellectuals
            in the two wars).
TH    2. The Question of Continental Philosophy: The Ethical Elements of the
            Disciplinary Frame
      READ: Deleuze and Guattari, What Is Philosophy? (as much as you can)
      READING GOAL / CLASS DISCUSSION: This volume outlines what a discipline does:
            what power and authority it exercises and/or conveys on its users. One important
            item is the question of how a discipline creates its personae, its authorized users.
            Today's discussion will require that you know the basic differences between the
            following terms; read at least the first paragraphs of each. We'll be discussing how
            they create /are created by histories and how they depend on position.

Week 3: 10, 12 September
TU    Ethics and Disciplinarity; Continental Philosophy as Epistemic Obstacle
      READ: Simon Critichley, Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction (excerpt)
      SKIM (if you are interested; totally optional):
            Feest and Sturm, "What (Good) Is Historical Epistemology?" (also Kitcher)
            Bachelard, The Formation of the Scientific Mind, 24-32 (definition of the
            epistemological obstacle).
      READING GOAL / CLASS DISCUSSION: Defining "historical epistemology" as the
            goal of humanities work: does this reflection on continental philosophy raise
            ethical questions about the discipline, as D&G would have seen it? Come in with an
            opinion and an example or two.
TH    3 . Legal frameworks for the Nazi State: The Nazi Constitutional Lawyer
      READ: Schmitt, Political Theology, foreword (skim) and section 1 (read to p 15, don't
            worry too much about the historical examples he uses)
              ---, Dictatorship, forewords, "Preliminary Remarks," and Chapter 1 (to p. 33)
      BACKGROUND: (be sure you know the conventional understanding of this law)
            • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933 and, if you have German,
            • https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermächtigungsgesetz_vom_24._März_1933
      READING GOAL: In this law and these texts, a line in drawn between the state's legality
            and its ethical duty vis-à vis its citizens - and for the authorization of the citizens.
            Schmitt is Germany's most important political theorist and constitutional jurist from
            the Weimar Republic, who worked though the Nazi era and into postwar West
            Germany's court system.
      DISCUSSION: Come in with a couple of examples of consequences of these legal
            decisions; come in with your opinion about Schmitt as an "ethical actor" within legal


            scholarship. In class we will also address the citizen-persona in his model (what
            can/should they do/not do).
Week 4: 17, 19 September
TU    Nazi -Era Theories of Government: Views from Within
      READ: These are technical presentations; look at tables of contents, initial introductory
            sections, and a topic that interests you -- passim, here and there
         • Sohn-Rethel, The Economy and Class Structure of German Fascism
         • Neumann, Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism, 1933-
              1944
      READING GOAL AND CLASS DISCUSSION: You've read how Schmitt defined the
            state; does his theory correspond with Neumann/Hays and/or Sohn-Rethel, or not?
            What is the ethics posited for the citizen-persona in each? (We'll establish partners
            for the Précis due next week.)
SECTION 2: Intellectuals Who Stayed: Postwar Ground of Ethics?
TH    The Classic Discussion of German Guilt
      READ: Jaspers, The Question of German Guilt, passim, but make sure you know the
              types he adduces.
            • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_traveller
            • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration_with_the_Axis_Powers_during_Wo

            • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason
            • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_during_World_War_II
         READING GOAL: Jaspers combines psychology, theology, and philosophy to
            amplify the idea of an ethical persona, working in the traditions of (German)
            existentialism. How do his categories amplify the problem of ethics for individuals
            caught in a political catastrophe?
Week 5: 24, 26 September
TU    Does Guilt Persist?: The Role of Language
      READ:
         • Klemperer: LTI: Language of the Third Reich, start to p. 24, 259-283
         • <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTI_–_Lingua_Tertii_Imperii>
         • Bourdieu, Political Ontology of Martin Heidegger, Introduction & Chap. 1 (up
              through 39); rest optional
      READING GOAL: Arguments about fascist language and the alignment of fascism and
         everyday life were front and center in postwar Germany. Is this an ethical challenge
         for individuals? Decide and exemplify, possibly with reference to Jaspers.
      WRITING ASSIGNMENT DUE: Synthetic Précis 1 on Schmitt and the structures of
         Nazi State (work with a partner): what sorts of acts by individuals and groups are
         implicit in his theories, and what are the values espoused by his work for the state and
         individuals.
TH    The Case of Heidegger: Existentialism, Existence, Nazi Ontology?
       READ:


       • "Building, Dwelling, Thinking"
       • Hölderlin's Hymn "The Ister" [Danube], pp. 6-10 &161-165; skim § 10-16
       • RECOMMNDED: "Interview 1966" (with Der Spiegel, Germany's news magazine)
       • RECOMMENDED: Letter on Humanism
       READING GOAL: These texts represent core concepts of Heidegger's existentialism,
          his philosophy of "being-in-the-world" (don't panic -- we'll discuss what's crazy about
          his language). How does he define human existence?
       CLASS DISCUSSION: Heidegger's idea of humans' mission in the world -- the ethics
          of being human. Partner work in class
Week 6: 1, 3 October
TU    Heidegger in Context: Institutional Ethics, Disciplinary Power, Gleichschaltung
      READ:
          • Heidegger, "Self-Assertion of the German University"
          • Goebbels, "Total War"
          • <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichschaltung>
          • Emmanuel Faye, Heidegger, passim (whatever interests you -- this offers "proof"
               of Heidegger's Nazi
      READING GOAL AND CLASS DISCUSSION: Remember The Political Ontology of
           Martin Heidegger -- Nazi language, Nazi institution, Nazi thought?
SECTION 3: Exiles: Intellectuals who left* and Their Ethical Personae
      * Be sure to identify the exact conditions under which they left: exile, refugee,
               emigrant, resister, Mitläufer, ethnic Other . . .
TH    Philosopher Responding to Heidegger (Questions of Disciplinary Actors)
      READ:
          • Cassirer, Myth of the State, 248-296
          • Williamson, "Review of Continental Divide"
      READING GOAL: What are the ethical implications of such an "exchange"?
      CLASS DISCUSSION: Agree or disagree with Williamson's assessment of philosophy's
               responsibilities toward history.
      WRITTEN ASSIGNMENT DUE: Synthetic Précis 2 comparing Jaspers' notions of guilt
           with specific situations cited in other texts, with the goal of critiquing his model. Is
           it (or not) adequate to expressing what is at stake for a persona subject to political
           power (and what kind)? (Work with a partner.)
Week 7: 8, 10 October
TU    Philosopher Responding to "The Situation" (Later Reaction to Discipline)
      READ:
          • Popper, The Open Society, Vol. 2: p.8; Chapter 12: Hegel; Chapters 23-25
      READING GOAL AND CLASS DISCUSSION: In one sense, Popper's essay responds
          to Heidegger; in another, he anticipates Deleuze/Guattari. Be prepared to argue for or
          against Popper as a statement about the ethics of doing philosophy.


TH    Philosopher Eliding Connections between WW II and Cold War
      READ:
         • Marcuse, One-Dimensional Man, introduction, Chapter 2.
         • <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderweg>
      READING GOAL: A major ethical argument about Germany's way into and through the
          Nazi era is the idea of Germany's "special path" into fascism. Marcuse brings
          forward a critique that echoes the analyses of the Nazi state we started the semester
          with. What claims are being made about what states and individuals?
SECTION 4: The Ethics of Positionality: Working In Between
      *These cases raise questions about positionality: the position out of which the speaker
          speaks, and to where, with what claims of authority. These voices intervened in
          Western policy during and after the war to influence judgments like Jaspers' about
          Germany's/Germans' guilt and innocence.
Week 8: 15, 17 October
TU    Migration, Refugee, Inner Immigration
      READ:
         • Krohn, Intellectuals in Exile: Refugee Scholars and the New School for Social
              Research (electronic resource; locate off of UT library catalogue): Chap. 2 & 9
         • <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_emigration>
         • Martin Jay, Permanent Exiles, Introduction, Chap 2 & 3
      READING GOAL: All exiles/refugees are not the same status, and there were hot
               arguments about the authority of who could speak for Germany about the Nazi
               era. Think about these cases and come in ready to talk about what various
               statuses imply (inner immigration, refugee, voluntary or involuntary exile, etc.).
                      This becomes critical for the cases to come: the question of address of the
               texts needs to be foregrounded. The texts we have read to this point are written
               by Germans in Germany more or less for Germans; after this point, writers also
               have to factor in post-war and Cold War politics -- how Germany will be treated
               as a "losing power" but also very soon as a nation needed to counter the rise of
               Stalinism. "Germany" and the "Germans" need rehabilitation, and the WW II
               Allies "needs" Germany as a bulwark against Soviet expansionism.
      WRITING ASSIGNMENT DUE: Synthetic Précis 3: pick any Section 3 text and set it
          into a context to evaluate its ethical claims as responses to the Nazi era or to one of
          the intellectuals who worked in it: are they adequate responses to the era's ethical
          and cognitive challenges? (Solo work.)
TH    The Frankfurt School and Political Psychoanalysis: The Allies' Guilt
      READ: Read around in both texts to get an idea of their diagnoses of the Germans
         • Neumann, et al., Secret Reports on Nazi Germany.
         • Adorno, et al., Authoritarian Personality
       READING GOAL: These two texts originate before the end of WW II (Authoritarian
            Personality replicates a survey in the Weimar Republic that was done on the
            psychology of the working classes; both are funded by the US Government).


      DISCUSSION: The ethical question: can one divorce "the people" from their
              government in general, and if so, is this the way to do it?
Week 9: 22, 24 October
TU    Psychoanalyzing Germany, 1
      READ:
         • Mitscherlich, The Inability to Mourn, Foreword, Introduction, and Chapter 1
         • < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_of_1968 >
       READING GOAL: This book was fostered by the Frankfurt School as part of its
            ongoing interest in the public sphere. Discussion: how does this relate to the two
            prior texts? How does this relate to the protests of 1968?
       DISCUSSION: how does this relate to the two prior texts? How does this relate to the
            protests of 1968? More particularly, where does this argument stand WRT Jaspers'
            schema -- and should it be configured this way???
TH    Psychoanalyzing Germany, 2
      READ:
         • Eisner, The Haunted Screen, Chapter 1
         • Kracauer, From Caligari to Hitler, Introduction (see Jay, Chap. 11 for interesting
              background)
      READING GOAL: Eisner was an art historian; Kracauer, a media theorist and member
              of the Frankfurt School. Both books were written to secure Germany's place
              among the Western powers and to defer questions of collective guilt.
      DISCUSSION: What kind of authority does each writer claim for her-/his own speaking
              position? What kind of German guilt is being assumed, if any?
      WRITING ASSIGNMENT: Short essay (3-5 pp.) applying Jaspers' idea of guilt to
              analyzing another text as representing an ethical problem. See format description
              for assignments for format details.
Week 10: 29, 31 October
TU    Psychoanalyzing Germany, 3
      READ:
         • Arendt, Origins of Totalitarianism: Vol. 1: 3 prefaces; skim part 3 (read a
              couple pages in each chapter so her argument is clear to you).
      READING GOAL: Arendt was a German-Jewish intellectual, student of both Jaspers and
              Heidgger (read her biography, please), who assumed the position of a public
              intellectual in the US during and after WW II. The Banality of Evil is her most
              famous book; Totalitarianism is her most important. What ethical claims does she
              make as she describes the totalitarian state?
TH    Psychoanalyzing Germany, 4
      READ:
         • Fromm, Escape from Freedom (aka The Fear of Freedom), Chapters 4, 5, & 6,
              pp. 58-124 in pdf.
         • Erikson, Identity and the Life Cycle, Section 1 (pp. 17-50)
         • Horney, "Can You Take a Stand>"


      READING GOAL: Fromm and Erikson were affiliated with the Frankfurt School in
              Germany; Horney, with leftist analysts. All three were marginalized by émigré
              communities, while becoming major forces in US intellectual life. What makes
              them like or unlike previous analytic texts you've read?
Week 11: 5, 7 November
TU    Psychoanalyzing Germany, 5
      READ:
          • Wilhelm Reich, Mass Psychology of Fascism, Chapters 1 & look around at TOC
              and Chapter 2
      READING GOAL: Reich was part of the leftist psychoanalytic landscape in Berlin
              before the war; he was famed for going a little new age loopy in his old age in
              California. Nonetheless, this work brings us back to where we started: with the
              state and how it constructs its citizens. Be sure you know what "mass
              psychology" is.
      DISCUSSION: How does this compare with one or more of our earlier texts (think
              particularly Schmitt and Arendt, but not exclusively).
SECTION 5: Ethics and Intellectual Property
      *These cases raise questions of intellectual property, attribution, what might be called
      careerism. Here, we treat issues from WW II and WW I, with reference to what
      "intellectual property" means in fraught circumstances.

      DISCUSSION: In class, we'll discuss the ethics of using this "research" and the ethics of
              each situation's use. The Wikipedia definitions will help point to what is at stake.
      WRITTEN ASSIGNMENT DUE: Abstract for your final project. Include a statement of
              your TOPIC (what you will discuss, your general issues), your DATA (which
              texts and what information you're drawing on), and your goal (why this is
              important to consider, what you get by doing the analysis your way). 250 -300
              words; see assignment formats for presentation instructions.


Week 12: 12, 14 November
TU    Writing Disciplinary History, 1
      READ:
         • Victor Kraft, The Vienna Circle, Introduction, Preface, Part 1, Part 2.B.III
         • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Circle
      READING GOAL: Find at least three disparities between the accounts.
      DISCUSSION: Look up who Kraft is and speculate what limitations his point of view
            has. What may have motivated his changes? Who is his audience?
TH    Writing Disciplinary History, 2
      READ: "The Vienna Circle Manifesto"
      READING GOAL: Compare this account to the ones you read last time.
      DISCUSSION: The question of historical epistemology: if we go into reading the VC's
            texts after reading these different accounts, what happens to our readings, to how
            we evaluate the texts, and to our choices in what we read?
Week 13: 19, 21 November
TU    Case study: Neurath and Wittgenstein
      READ:
         • Neurath, ---. "The Departmentalization of Unified Science," Erkenntnis VII

         • ---. "The danger of careless terminology" (1941)
         • Wittgenstein, "The Blue Book," The Blue and Brown Books
      READING GOAL AND DISCUSSION: Debate the following assertion: "These two
            thinkers are working in the same paradigm (model) because they both see language
            as a system under local control, and so need to be considered as common
            intellectual property. "
TH    Wilhelm Wundt: The Source for Modern Social Sciences
      READ:
         • Wundt, Elements of Folk Psychology, "Preface" and pp. 1-10
         • Cassirer, Language and Myth (passim)
         • WRITING ASSIGNMENT DUE: Preparation for your final project: turn in the
             section(s) of your paper that describes/situates the text/event you are addressing,
             along with the bibliography / foot- or endnotes that need to be there -- the who,
             what, where, and when of the materials. Purpose: to allow feedback on how you
             are researching and presenting your materials (format and context check). Turn in
             at least three pages, but no more than 5; the submission may be in more than one
             section. Example: the origin of a text you're discussing (including information
             on the author and the publication, along with its historical moment); or the
             historical incident / moment that is critical to the contents. I expect Chicago
             Manual of Style or MLA style notes/bibliography. See
             <https://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/writing> and/or
             <https://www.lib.utexas.edu/noodlebib> .

        • Dewey, "The New Psychology" (1884)
             <http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dewey/newpsych.htm>
        • ---, "My Pedagogic Creed" (1897)
        • Isaac, Working Knowledge, "Prologue"
      READING GOAL: Today's lecture will set the stage for what your teacher considers a
              major theft of intellectual property by means of the history of disciplines: the
              erasure of German intellectual heritage in the US. Be ready to describe what
              Dewey does to define human mind and its ability to change.
 TH    Thanksgiving Holiday
Week 15: 3, 5 December
TU    The Limits and Necessity of Historical Epistemology: A Morality Fable

GENERAL NOTES ON ASSIGNMENTS AND ASSIGNMENT FORMATS:
************************
            Each type of assignment and exam has its own description below or appended to this page. Please read them through
carefully, because they constitute the contract that the instructor is making with you -- they are the basis for your grades. All
written assignments must be submitted in hard copy at the start of the class period when they are due. The professor will not
accept emailed assignments UNLESS the directions say to submit electronically. Online exams/tests are online at the class
Canvas site (accessible over the UT homepage). The Canvas gradebook will have your assignment and test grades.
            Make sure your email is updated with the University (also through UT Direct) -- emails do NOT update automatically
through the system unless you update your profile on UT Direct; also make sure you pick up your email and/or set your listservs
on digest so that your email account does not fill up. The instructor is not responsible for emails rejected because your box is
full, or lost because you've failed to update your address or check your emails; emails are official UT correspondence and are
considered valid notifications if sent to the address you provide, whether received or not. Remember, too, that on Canvas you
can set announcements to be delivered by email or pushed to your favorite device in other forms.
            Get familiar with your computer and with campus IT resources early in the semester. Also make sure that your
operating system and software are up to date. You can get cheap upgrades from the Campus Computer store, and free
consulting is available in the Flawn Center; downloads available online under BEVOWARE and your EID at
<http://www.utexas.edu/its/bevoware/>. Campus services online will fail you at odd times if your OS and browser are not up to
campus norms -- UPDATE YOUR operating system NOW.
            If electronic submission is required, you may not turn in ANY written work in electronic form in any other program than
MS -Office (MS-Word, .doc or .docx, NOT .dot), or (for other kinds of assignments not used here) in PowerPoint -- this is the
campus norm and is the only set of programs guaranteed to work on electronic submissions on virtually all platforms/machines
on campus. We all like other options better; but we only have support for STANDARD SOFTWARE for the 75,000 people using
university systems each day. Powers that be will NOT love you for originality.
            The instructor answers email during business hours (M-F 8-5); no texts accepted. Do not expect responses in the
morning just before class, in less than 24 hours, or on weekends. Email must be used politely, as the equivalent of a phone call,
not as an on-demand message board. This is particularly important for online quizzes and projects; if you are unsure about the
technology, start early so that problems may be addressed in a timely fashion.
            Read to the end of this general assignment memo, and remember that each assignment has its own additional
directions; you will be responsible for following all directions. Due dates as indicated on the syllabus/calendar.
************************


Written Assignments: General Information
(see descriptions of each assignment for its length and details)
************************
FORMAT FOR ASSIGNMENTS TURNED IN ON PAPER
      • Typed
      • Double spaced, 1 inch margins all round.
      • 11 or 12-point type, Arial, Times, or Times New Roman font
      • Your name and a page number on EVERY PAGE (top right or bottom center or bottom right -- use "header" or "footer"
           window to insert).
      • Pages must be stapled together. Instructors do NOT provide staples, clips, or staplers.
      • All citations (footnotes or endnotes, and bibliography) must be in "Chicago Style" or "MLA Style."
                 o Is this statement a mystery? See < http://www.lib.utexas.edu/refsites/style_manuals.html> for general
                       information or < http://www.lib.utexas.edu/noodlebib/ > to use Noodlebib.
                 o You may use either a reference list and in-text citations or notes with complete bibliographic information
                       about all texts used and page references to citations, but your assignment MUST have the complete
                       bibliographic information for the book(s) and/or article(s) you are referring to, even if it's just one item.


OVERVIEW OF GRADING PRACTICES
************************
           This class will use +/- grading. All assignment grades will be posted on the Canvas website. The grades will be
posted as points or percentages, with each assignment's point totals indicated. Check your grades often; protests will only be
entertained within one week of grade postings. The final grade will be weighted as below, combining the individual elements
posted.
Conversions of Letter Grades and Numerical Percentages:
      • A+=97-100; A = 95-96; A- = 90-94 (note: this is generous: standard practice makes 95-100 = A )
      • B+=87-89; B = 85-86; B- = 80-84;
      • C+=77-79; C = 75-76; C- = 70-74;
      • D+=67-69; D = 65-66; D- = 60-64;
      • F = below 60.
This semester's assignment percentages, indicated as a percentage of final grade:
      • 3 précis (synthetic précis) situating texts into historical context to address the covert ethical / evaluative assumptions of
           their presentations = 3 x 5% of course grades = 15 % of grade (two done in pairs)
      • 1 short essay (3-5 pp.) applying Jaspers' idea of guilt to analyzing another text as representing an ethical problem =
           25 % of Grade
      • 1 essay (final project) for the defense or prosecution of an ethics trial: combining research in the history and situation
           of a particular text with a reading of the text's contents, to make a systematic case for or against its overt or covet
           ethical claims. The project will be done in phases:
           o 10% of grade= abstract/proposal,
           o 20 % for bibliography and "history of" section (the exposition of the facts), and
           o 30% for the final essay presenting a case (ca. 15 pages).
      Deductions:
      • Any late assignments will be docked one letter per day late; without prior arrangement, not accepted at all after the
           next class period without proof of medical or equivalent emergency (e.g. doctor's note).
      • Any rescheduling of due dates must be done a MINIMUM of 14 days before the work is due. These are the standards
           that University athletes are held to; all students can do the same.
      • No work may be submitted by email unless prior arrangements are made.
      • Work submitted without page numbers, without your name on each page, and/or not stapled will automatically have a
           deduction of three points off its grade.
Readings and Reading Assignments:
           The readings listed on the syllabus are complete texts and excerpts from many different sources, as well as websites,
as indicated in the syllabus. The class materials modules on the class Canvas Site have live URLs to make it easier to find the
web readings; you can access them directly from your device of choice. Texts marked as PDFs may be downloaded from the
class site, from the "Files" link in the left navigation bar, where you will find them organized by author and title. The complete list
of PDFs and the books from which readings are drawn are listed in the READINGS document.
           Reading assignments are due THE DAY THEY ARE LISTED on the syllabus.
           WARNING ON READINGS: The syllabus modules include links to many websites, many from Wikipedia. Wikipedia
may NOT be used for academic research, but it contains many useful plot summaries and basic (and mostly correct, if not
flagged) information. Start with Wikipedia, but distrust and verify.
           WHAT YOU MUST READ: Some URLs are links to articles that must be read or websites that you must skim; the
articles and webpages marked as "lecture background" would be good to skim (that is, read at least the introductory paragraph
before class, if you can); they are listed so that you can use the material there to clear up your class notes on spellings, dates,
etc.
           AFTER MOST CLASSES, the class PowerPoints will be made available in a file on the class Canvas site.
