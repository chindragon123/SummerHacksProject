AMS 310/HIS 315G is an introductory course in American Studies, a field that examines American
culture and society from multiple perspectives. Using a variety of sources and methods, this course
takes as its focal point American attitudes regarding place, landscape, community, nature, and the
physical environment as demonstrative of social values both historic and current, dominant and
resistant. This course examines three major conceptual categories connecting the North American
continent and the people who have inhabited it—landscape and the physical environment, people
and place, and community and place-making—demonstrating great transformations in American
society, culture, and everyday life, while also showing main currents and trajectories over time. The
interdisciplinary approach of this course draws upon history, geography, sociology, literature,
popular culture, and other methods of inquiry to reveal a history fraught with political and social
conflicts that complicate narratives of national consensus.
Class format: This is primarily a lecture course but I encourage questions and discussion.
Learning is collaborative!


Supplemental Instruction (SI): SI consists of optional discussion sections led by one of the course
TAs, Kate Grover. These sessions will help reinforce and clarify course content plus help you to learn
the material more effectively. SI also gives you a smaller forum for discussing course content and
getting to know your classmates. Regular participation in SI discussion, although optional, has been
shown to improve students’ performance by an average of one-half to one full letter grade higher
than the class mean.
Requirements: Regular attendance, completion of all reading and assignments, three exams.
Goals/outcomes: As members of this intellectual community, you will:
1. Gain a greater understanding of people, places, groups, events, and ideas throughout American
history how they have impacted American culture and society in their time and in ours.
2. Engage with a variety of types of texts and evidence to become interdisciplinary interpreters of
American history.
3. Build critical thinking and analysis skills through written expression, including constructing thesis
statements and supporting your argument with evidence from lecture and readings.
Grading:
First exam                      20%     Oct 3, in class
Place analysis (3 pgs)          10%     Oct 19
Second exam                     30%     Nov 5, in class
Final exam                      40%     Day, time, location TBA
Grading scale: A 93-100; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76; C- 70-72; D+ 67-69;
D 63-66; D- 60-62; F 0-59
Exam format: All exams will be closed book/notes. Exam I will consist of FIVE identification questions
(choice of 10) and Exam II will consist of ONE essay (choice of 2). There will be a review session held
before each exam. The final exam will be closed book/notes and will contain EIGHT (8) IDs (choice of
15) and ONE essay (choice of 2). The IDs on the final will be taken from the last third of the course
but the essay will require you to integrate and synthesize material from the entire semester to
construct your analysis. On all tests, you will be expected to write your essay answers with
supporting evidence from the assigned readings and lectures. For this reason, regular class
attendance is crucial in order to do well in the course. Do not rely on the inevitable Google doc as a
substitute for reading or attending lecture. I do not post lecture slides to Canvas.
Make-up policy: Failure to take a scheduled exam without making prior arrangements with the
teaching assistant or me will result in an automatic zero for that exam. I will allow you to take a
make-up exam only in the event of a medical or family emergency, or if you have official,
documented University of Texas at Austin business outside of campus. In both cases, you must notify
the TA or me BEFORE the scheduled exam, unless extraordinary circumstances while traveling to the
exam dictate otherwise, in which case official documentation will still be required. All make-up
exams must be taken at 8 a.m. one week after the scheduled exam.
Post-exam protocol: If you would like the TA to review your exam after it has been graded, please
carefully review the comments and wait a minimum of 24 hours before contacting the TA.
Thereafter, make sure to address all questions about your grade within eight days after you have
received your exam back. If you do not reach an understanding with the TA, then I will be happy to
review your exam as well. Please keep your exams as they will help you as you review for the final
exam.


Required readings: All required texts will be in the course reader, available for purchase at Jenn’s
Copies (2518 Guadalupe St). I encourage each of you to be active readers and interact with the texts
by underlining, highlighting, and engaging with the texts as you see fit. Please show up to class ready
to discuss the assigned texts.
Attendance: Students are expected to attend class regularly and to participate as best they can in
such a sizable class. Regular and punctual attendance will be rewarded with TWO extra credit points
that will be added to your final exam grade. The TAs will have a sign-in sheet in designated spots in
the lecture hall, where you will sign in before the beginning of each class with your sign-in TA. Please
be on time to class: you will not be able to sign in if you are late. Moreover, students who sign in and
then leave class will not receive credit for that class date. I will waive THREE absences without
question during the semester, so that you can receive the two extra credit points. This attendance
policy will begin on 9/10/18. The only exceptions to this policy apply to students who must miss
class to observe a religious holiday or sanctioned travel related to university sports or military
service. However, you must present me with the documentation regarding your absence for any of
these reasons by 9/10/18 for this exemption to apply.
Office hours: I encourage you to come to office hours during the semester so you can get the most
out of the course. This is an opportunity for you to discuss exam expectations, aspects of the lecture
material or readings, or just to say hello.
Devices: Laptops and tablets in class must remain silent and may not be used for any reason other
than course-related material (this should go without saying, but no phones are to be used in class). I
trust you to use technology responsibly, but failure to abide by this policy may result in the
revocation of in-class laptop/tablet privileges at my discretion.
Communication: Course-related announcements, relevant or interesting links, potential changes to
the course schedule, and other important information will be posted to the course Canvas site (and
therefore sent to you via email), so please check your email at least once per day. All emails sent to
me will be responded to within 24 hours of receipt unless unforeseen circumstances arise.
Classroom conduct: This course is built upon discussing topics that are often controversial and
difficult. I encourage all of you to share your informed opinions, feeling, and experiences, and to
engage in conversations that invite productive and respectful disagreement. As such, we all must
maintain respect for the classroom environment and for our colleagues: no name-calling, slurs,
interrupting, or otherwise fashioning a hostile environment. Be willing to have your own points of
view challenged and be willing to respectfully challenge others. The most productive and exciting
intellectual growth emerges from engaging with diverse opinions.
Concealed handgun policy: Per official University of Texas policy, “It is the responsibility of
concealed-carry license holders to carry their handguns on or about their person at all times while on
campus. ‘About’ the person means that a license holder may carry a holstered handgun in a backpack
or handbag, but the backpack or handbag must be close enough that the license holder can grasp it
without materially changing position. The holster must completely cover the trigger area and have
enough tension to keep the gun in place if jostled. A license holder may not carry a partially or wholly
visible handgun on campus premises or on any university driveway, street, sidewalk, parking lot,
parking garage, or other parking area.” With this in mind, consider that the simplest thing for
conceal-carry license holders to do would be to leave their handgun in a safe, secure location rather
than bring it to class.
Flags: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity courses
are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural
experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from
assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one U.S. cultural group that has


experienced persistent marginalization. This course also fulfills the history core curriculum
requirement.
Students with disabilities: Any student with a documented disability who requires academic
accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259
(voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty members are not required to provide
accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.
Academic honesty: In an effort to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and integrity in the
classroom, cheating and plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. Cheating or plagiarism will result
in an automatic zero for the assignment and will be reported to the Dean of Students. University
policies regarding academic honesty are available at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php
TL;DR version: show up to class consistently, be respectful of each other, put phones away, use
laptops for class-related stuff only, don’t cheat on quizzes or exams.
