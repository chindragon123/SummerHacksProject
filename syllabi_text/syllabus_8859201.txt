EXPECTATIONS
Attendance is mandatory. Let us know in advance if you have to miss a class. In the event of
an absence, for any reason, a typed paper covering lesson points from the missed class
session must be submitted by the next class meeting. Notes can be obtained from a
classmate. If you miss a class for an unexcused reason or do not turn in a paper, your grade
will be impacted. Remember, one weekly class meeting is actually 3 class hours.
Acceptance of this syllabus means you agree to the class guidelines and meeting times. The group
project assignments, unannounced quizzes covering readings and date of final exam covering class
lectures and presentations will be discussed during the course of the semester. The course should be
dropped now if there is conflict concerning the guidelines, attendance or grade distribution.

and publish daily content while optimizing each platform to increase the visibility of her social
content. I am constantly improving her online presence by capturing and analyzing the
appropriate social metrics and insights, and then processing on the information.

planning and event management. I have interned at nonprofits such as Kids in a New Groove and
Young Life.
