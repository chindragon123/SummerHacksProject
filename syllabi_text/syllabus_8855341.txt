VIS COMM 3
The focus of Visual Communication III is continuous engagement with digital media in one’s
design process. Such an engagement will foster an ongoing evaluation of the conceptual and
practical impact of digital techniques on architectural and interior design production. The course
places increased emphasis on 3D design and integrates digital modeling with the students’ prior
experience working with graphic and imaging software. The aim is to provide students with a
foundation in parametric modeling, its relationship to the larger workflow in the digital realm,
along with setting up opportunities for working with various modes of output, including drawings,
robotics, and digitally fabricated models/installations.
\\\\
COURSE FORMAT
Vis Comm 3 is offered as a module system. There will be three modules. Each module will be
taught by a single instructor with a TA, and will be project-based while focusing on a particular
digital design tool/technique.


We will hold a lottery on the first day of class. After a brief presentation of the modules by the
instructors, students will rank their preferred module sequence. Every effort will be given to
place students in their first choice, but due to limited class size and other factors, students will
be assigned a sequence based on availability. If a student has no preference, they should note
“no preference” on their lottery ballot.
\\\\
MODULE FORMAT
A typical week will include a lecture/tutorial that will introduce conceptual and technical issues
covered in the current assignment, a demonstration of key software-related techniques, and
allotted time for a group Q&A. The remainder of class sessions will include desk crits, during
which students will be able to work on assignments and receive feedback from the teaching
assistants and faculty.
Digital copies of completed assignments will be submitted through Canvas and physical
prints/plots will be presented during group pin-ups, as outlined in individual assignment
handouts. Student work will be reviewed at pin-ups on the last day of each module.
Prerequisites
ARC/ARI 311L (Visual Communication II)
\\\\
COURSE REQUIREMENTS
Students are required to have a laptop computer by the first day of class that is capable of running
high performance 2d and 3d software applications and meets or exceeds the UTSOA
recommended laptop’s performance. Software will be listed on the handout for each module.
Please note that Revit and Grasshopper require the use of Windows. Although there is a Mac
version of Rhinoceros, we strongly recommend that you use the Windows version, as this is the
version that the in-class tutorials will be conducted in. This will have additional consequences
for Mac users, which will be discussed by the IT Director of UTSOA on the first day of class.
Weekly progress and participation in class pin-ups, desk crits and reviews is required.
The submission of high quality final images (jpeg format), progress images, 3d digital models,
and full documentation of project and design process on a thumb drive or via direct download is
mandatory. Failure to submit your work on the final day of class will result in a minimum full letter
grade drop in your final grade for the course.


\\\\
ATTENDANCE
Attendance is mandatory. Two (2) unexcused absences will result in a full letter grade drop in
your final grade for the course. Three (3) unexcused absences may result in failure and being
dropped from the course. Absences are only excused with written documentation of a medical
condition or family emergency. If you miss more than 25% of the semester due to illness or other
excused absences, you will be required to drop and retake the course. If you plan on missing
class for the observance of a religious holy day, please notify the instructor at least 14 days prior
per UT Austin policy. It is up to the student to complete work missed due to excused absences
within a reasonable time frame. If you show up late (5 minutes after the start of class) 3 times, it
will be counted as 1 unexcused absence.
\\\\
SCHEDULE
Class will begin at 2:00 PM Tuesday and Thursday.
On days of pin-ups and reviews, it is expected that your work is pinned up by 2:00pm. If you are
late pinning up, you will be counted as late or as an unexcused absence, depending on the
amount of tardiness.
Final submissions are due on the last day of each module session.
Intermediate deadlines will be noted on handouts for each assigned project.
\\\\
GRADING POLICY
Establishing grades for projects of a creative nature is a more complex matter than grading in
other academic areas. A significant portion of each grade is derived from a broader, more
subjective set of issues; however, in this course, a set of technique-based criteria – including
the appropriate usage of media, precision and exactness, and demonstrated knowledge of
graphic conventions relative to contemporary architectural representation – will play a large part
in evaluating student work.
Grades will be given for each module. Final grades will be an average of the 3. Each module will
include 2 grades (mid and final).
Grading is broken into three components for each given mark:
1/3 grasp       (the ideas and understanding of the project at hand, combined with an
                appropriate process of inquiry),
1/3 process     (the consistent and rigorous development and testing of ideas) and
1/3 resolution (the demonstration of competence, completeness, and finesse through
                representation).


A(-)     Excellent
         Project surpasses expectations in terms of inventiveness, appropriateness, visual
         language, conceptual rigor, craft, and personal development. Student pursues concepts
         and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. Project is complete on all
         levels.
B(+,-) Above Average
         Project is thorough, well presented, diligently pursued, and successfully completed.
         Student pursues ideas and suggestions presented in class and puts in effort to resolve
         required projects. Project is complete on all levels and demonstrates potential for
         excellence.
C(+,-) Average
         Project meets the minimum requirements. Suggestions made in class and not pursued
         with dedication and rigor. Project is incomplete in one or more areas.
D(+)     Poor
         Project is incomplete. Basic grasp of skill is lacking, visual clarity or logic of presentation
         are not level-appropriate. Student does not demonstrate the required competence and
         knowledge base.
F        Fail
         Project is unresolved. Minimum objectives are not met. Performance is not acceptable.
         Note that this grade will be assigned when you have excessive unexcused absences.
X        Excused Incomplete
         Can be given only for legitimate reasons of illness or family emergency. Simply not
         completing work on time is not an adequate cause for assigning this evaluation. It may
         only be used after consultation with the Associate Deans' offices and with an agreement
         as to a new completion date. Work must be completed before the second week of the next
         semester in which you are enrolling, according to the School of Architecture policy.
\\\\
DISABILITIES
Please notify your instructor of any adaptation you may require to accommodate a specific
physical need. You will be requested to provide documentation to the Dean of Student's Office,
in order that the most appropriate accommodations can be determined. Specialized services are
available on campus through the Services for Students with Disabilities, also found via the web
at: http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/ or by phone at 512.471.6259


\\\\
HONOR CODE
It is expected of every student to abide by the UT Honor Code. Dishonesty and/or the poor
treatment of your classmates will not be tolerated. The UT Honor Code (or statement of ethics)
and an explanation or example of what constitutes plagiarism can be found at:

\\\\
SAFETY AND SECURITY
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires
exiting and assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and
building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used
when entering the building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their
instructor in writing during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the
instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by
the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or
Fire Prevention Services office. To find more information regarding emergency evacuation routes
and emergency procedures go to: www.utexas.edu/emergency
