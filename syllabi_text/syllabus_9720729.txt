    1) Class participation and attendance (10%): Please note that attendance and
       participation both in class and online are factored into your final grade. Regular
       attendance and participation is required. One class absence is acceptable; each subsequent
       class absence will result in a 3-point reduction of the final grade. If you absolutely have
       to miss a class session, talk to me before about your plans for keeping up with the
       coursework and compensating—not eliminating—the absence. You are responsible for
       contacting a class member so that you are prepared for the next class session. When you
       come to class, please sign in on the attendance sheet. Tardies will also lower your final
       grade for this class.
    2) 3 Discussion Questions (DF1, DF2, and DF3) (10%): Answer three discussion forum

       questions and post comments to other classmates’ discussion questions. Questions are not
       prepared in advance and will be created based on classroom discussion and student input.
       The discussion questions will be posted following a class. Everyone must respond to a
       question by the following class. Your initial response to the question should be brief (2-3
       well developed paragraphs or 150-300 words) and can be written in Spanish, English or
       both. Responses will begin the following week and can be shorter, informal and in any
       language. You must respond to a minimum of four people.
    3) Plan for Language Self-Improvement (20%): Bilingual teachers provide language
       models, input, and feedback to their students in two languages. Diagnose your language
       ability in English and Spanish. What can you and can’t you do in each of your languages?
       Be specific. Where do you have difficulty using either of your languages? In what areas
       do you need improvement and why? What are you going to do to improve your language
       ability? Support your plan for improvement with second language acquisition
       experiences. List both experiences and a timeline. Submit your plan on 9/22. Submit your
       activity log and reflections on 12/01.
    4) Short Unit and Lesson Plan (20%): In groups of 4, design a short unit (a series of at
       least 4 lessons on a topic). Your unit needs to integrate at least 2 content areas, but could
       cross several content areas. The short unit should be in Spanish and English or just
       Spanish. In your unit, you will make modifications and accommodations to address the
       needs of your learners based on principles of working with second language learners.
       Each member of the group will then choose 1 lesson in the short unit to develop in-depth.
       You can still collaborate and work-together, but you will be graded on your individual
       lesson. You will provide a 1 page written analysis of the lesson in terms of how your
       instruction supports bilingual language acquisition and biliteracy development, referring
       to theories we have learned and readings/discussions we have shared. More details
       including lesson plan formats will follow.
    5) Mid-Term Take Home Exam (15%): You will be given 1 week to write a 3 page
       teaching philosophy discussing principles or beliefs that will guide your teaching for your
       chosen teaching context.
    6) Final Take Home Exam (20%): You will be provided with statements in second
       language acquisition. For example, bilingual dual-language programs like mine are
       remedial programs for students who do not speak English. You will analyze and express
       your views regarding each statement.
    7) Presentation of Learning (5%): On the last day of class, you will present what you have
       learned over the course of the semester. This can be done in any medium (i.e. video,
       poem, dance, power-point, short story, interactive lesson) and should last no longer than
       5 minutes. Grades are based on completion.

    •   Course Drop Dates
University policy on course drop dates states:
“A student may not drop a course after the twelfth class day in the long session except for good
cause (e.g., health or serious personal problems, or a demonstrated need to work more hours). A
graduate student seeking to drop a class after the twelfth class day should go to the department
offering the course.”
    •   Religious Holidays
University policy on holy days states:
“A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence
as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable
time after the absence.”
    •   Accommodations
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations
for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
    •   Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.
    •   Academic Integrity
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty: Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty
are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or
dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the
integrity of the University, policies on scholastic integrity will be strictly enforced. For further
information, please visit Student Judicial Services Web site (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs)
or call 471-2841 for the official university policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty.
    •   Note from the Center for the Core Curriculum
This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity
courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American
cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come
from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one U.S. cultural group
that has experienced persistent marginalization. (In our case, Latinos and Immigrant
communities.)
