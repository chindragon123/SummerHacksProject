                                         Course Description:
Every year in early December Time magazine announces a “Person of the Year.” This is a
tradition that has gone on since 1927. But 2017 was a different year and the popular
magazine went in a different direction. Instead of naming one person, they named a team
of women referred to as the “silence breakers” persons of the year. These women
participated in a movement that was initiated by a black woman, Tarana Burke (pictured
above). The #MeToo movement actually began more than ten years ago when Burke
started a campaign against sexual assault. Black women have been trailblazers in national
and international movements for centuries. Sometimes they sought justice in small spaces
and in other times, they took their activism to an international stage. Some of these
women are the focus of this course which is a study of African American women in the
United States from the moment they stepped foot on this land until today.
                                              Class Etiquette:
Each student is expected to attend class, participate in discussions, and complete all
reading and writing assignments by the deadlines indicated in this syllabus or any written
addenda. Class discussions are an important component and students will be graded on
their participation, contributions to discussions, and engagement with their peers. It is the
student’s responsibility to come to class prepared to discuss the reading for this course;
therefore, each student must arrive with two discussion questions based upon the weekly
readings. Students are not allowed to record class interactions unless they have written
permission from the professor. Please arrive to class on time and turn off cell phones.
                                              Grading Policy:
Please note that this class, like other undergraduate courses at UT, utilizes plus and minus
options for final grades. However, class assignments are based on a point system with an


overall course total of 100 points (see below). Class attendance is mandatory and late
assignments are not accepted. The professor will consider medical or other emergencies
with written documentation and/or prior notification on a case-by-case basis.
                        Assignments/Deadlines/ Grade Percentages:
    1. Class Participation:                Every Week                               15%
    2. Arrival Narratives – Group Project:        Sept. 17                          15%

                                   Policies and Procedures:
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
toward peers and community.
Plagiarism
The University's Institutional Rules (Section 11-802(d)) define plagiarism as including, "but
not limited to, the appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining by any other
means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source . . . and presenting
that material as one's own academic work offered for credit." In other words, “handing in
someone else's work and taking credit for it as if it were your own.” Source: History
Department statement on Academic Integrity:
http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/history/about/academic-integrity.php
For examples of plagiarism see the site above or the Student Judicial Services Website.
Documented Disability Statement
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact
Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 232-2937 (video phone) or
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd.
Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students
E-mail is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, students
are responsible for reading their e-mail for university and course-related information and
announcements. Students are responsible to keep the university informed about changes
to their e-mail address. Students should check their e-mail regularly and frequently—the
university recommends daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with
university-related communications, some of which may be time-critical. Students can find
UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating their e-mail address at:
http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
E-mail in recent years has often mistakenly become a substitute for office hours and
students sometimes abuse e-mail by the nature of their comments, requests, demands, and
questions. This practice will not be tolerated.
Writing Center
BERRY AFR 374D Fall 2018
Page 3 of 10


The professor strongly encourages students to use the Undergraduate Writing Center, FAC
211, 471-6222: http://www.uwc.utexas.edu/). The UWC offers free, individualized, expert
help with writing for any UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis. These
services are not just for writing challenges. Getting feedback from an informed audience is
a normal part of any successful writing project. The UWC’s trained consultants work with
students from every department on both academic and non-academic writing. Using
methods that preserve the integrity of students’ work, they help students develop strategies
to improve their writing and become a more independent writer. Whether students are
writing a lab report, a resume, a term paper, a statement for an application, or their own
poetry, UWC consultants are available.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, students must notify the professor of their pending absence at least
fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If students must miss
a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious
holy day, the professor will give students an opportunity to complete the missed work
within a reasonable time after the absence.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If students are worried about someone who is acting differently, they may use the
Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone their concerns about another
individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a partnership among the Office of
the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee
Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD).
Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
requires exiting and assembling outside. Become familiar with all exit doors of each
classroom and building occupied. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the
one used when entering the building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall
inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class. In the event of an
evacuation, follow the instructions of the faculty. Do not re-enter a building unless given
instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin
Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
                                     COURSE SCHEDULE:
The professor reserves the right to deviate from or modify parts of this schedule. All
changes will include written notice and any modified syllabi will be posted on Canvas.
