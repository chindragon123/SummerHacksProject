                             Asian American Literature and Culture
This is a course that asks you to rethink Asian American literature and culture from the
perspective of aesthetics, history, and empire. You will find that the different
experimentations in artistic expressions encountered here will testify to the richness and
contradictions of what it means to be Asian American. We will be asking difficult questions:
What is America, racial oppression, empire, nationhood, and the English language? What is a
homeland, a place, a sense of belonging? What is family, history, and generational memory
and trauma? What is a “good” immigrant and what is a “bad” immigrant? And are these
understandings dictated by law, the media, historical events, or global politics? As you read
the many texts on the syllabus, these authors will not always have easy answers to these hard
questions, nor will they necessarily agree, yet they are all invested in the constant
dismantling of our assumptions and our definitions. Starting with seminal theoretical
concepts on immigration and global empire to foreground our course, we will then explore
different genres and forms of writing, such as, short stories, the graphic novel, the global
novel, poetry, non-fiction, young adult and children literature. We will participate in the act
of close reading and learn how to pay attention to the details of language and try to struggle
with the many different possible interpretations. We will learn about Japanese internment,
the Chinese Exclusion Act, activist solidarities between African and Asian Americans, the
history of coolies, partition of India, the Cold War, American colonialism, and Asian
migration and politics. We will also critically think through cultural authenticity, cultural
representation, gender, queerness, and class. I hope by the end of this course, you will realize
through your own writing, reading, and research that there is always something more
complex and infinitely more powerful than what we believe about Asian Americans.
Course Requirements
Close Reading Journals
Every week you will submit online a close reading entry before class. Each entry should be
around 100-300 words analyzing a specific word, sentence, image, or passage of the text. 3 of
the lowest grades will be dropped.
Research Summary
There will be a short paper (1 – 1.5 pages, single space) due during the second half of the
semester. You need to select one of the historical research or criticisms you have found so far
that contextualizes the text you have chosen to analyze for your final paper. You then
summarize the historical research or criticism, stating the argument and the evidence of the
material. The purpose of this assignment is to help you learn how to incorporate, quote,
summarize sources that can enrich your final paper.
Final Paper


Critically analyze one or two texts from our reading in a paper of 8-10 pages (double-spaced).
You should have at least one outside source to help you contextualize and understand the
text. A rough draft of 4-5 (double-spaced) pages is due the thirteenth week of class.
Workshopping Ideas
This is a workshop class where we start out in solitary writing then we expand to a group
activity of helping one another and sharing our works.
Peer Review
The peer review session is mandatory and essential to the writing process. It teaches students
to learn how to write and edit among a community of peers.
Presentations
Near the end of the semester, you need to sign up for a presentation day. Your task is to have
an interpretation and argument ready for your paper and present it in class among your
peers. The presentation should be no longer than 5 minutes. The purpose of the presentation
is to simulate a conference experience and teach you the skills of oral, digital, and visual
presentation which is different than simply writing a paper.
Attendance
You are expected to attend all sessions and participate in discussions, many of which will be
based on the readings. One letter grade will be lowered if you miss more than 3 classes.
Class Participation
You are expected to speak up, participate in in-class activities and discussion, engage with
your teacher and your peers to get full credit. If you have never spoken up in class, it is safe
to say you will not get a passing participation grade.
