  Course Objectives
   Upon completion of this course, students will be able to
      • Describe basic concepts and issues related to diversity in schools, the workplace, and
              the community
      • Articulate their individual comfort level toward persons with disabilities
      • Describe the following concepts related to disabilities: legal and theoretical
              definitions, prevalence and etiologies, educational and social/emotional
              characteristics, family involvement and dynamics, life span issues, and assistive
              technology
      • Describe the socio-cultural and linguistic factors that influence perceptions of
              disability, quality of life, and services for persons with special needs
      • Discuss the legal mandates and controversial issues associated with addressing the
              needs of individuals who differ from those in mainstream of society
Important Notes
• We use Announcements to communicate with the class. We encourage you to set your Canvas
  up so that you receive an email when an Announcement is made.
• Track your progress on Canvas. This way you can ensure that all of your coursework is turned in
  and recorded on Canvas.
• Laptops are allowed in class as long as they are being used for course purposes. Be
  responsible with your laptop usage; using your laptop for other purposes (shopping, chatting,
  emailing, working on other assignments) negatively affects your learning AND the learning of those
  around you. It’s not worth it. At times, we may request that laptops be put away.
• We will use the class Facebook Page to post articles, video clips, etc. You do not have to
  engage by pinning or commenting. We will not friend you on FB; we use FB as it is a relatively easy
  platform to use, and most of us are somewhat familiar with it.
• Life happens. Please let us know if things beyond this course may be affecting your ability to
  complete work for this class in a timely manner.
• This class works best when you participate. We make it as engaging as we can, and we are
  open to ways to make it more engaging. That said, we can’t do it alone. You have to help.
• Our job is literally for you to be successful in this class. We have designed this class to
  accommodate a wide range of student needs. We are willing and able to accommodate any
  learning needs that a student might have. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you
  from learning or exclude you, please let us know as soon as possible. We encourage students
  with disabilities to register with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) and inform Dr.
  Tackett, in writing. http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/

                                  We will discuss each assignment in class. Detailed guidelines
                                  and evaluation criteria for assignments will be provided. The
                                  following descriptions serve merely as an overview of the
     Assignments at               expectations for each assignment. All assignments are due at
          a Glance                8:00 a.m. on the dates indicated (unless otherwise specified).
                                  Five percent will be deducted for each day an assignment

   2. 12 Content Responses        by 8 am on May 14th.
   3. What I May Want to          1. Presence (Attendance & Participation): 56 points. Your

   4. 2 Exams                     learning of those around you. You are expected to attend class
                                  sessions and access the assigned content. That said,
   5. Exceptionality Matrix
                                  attendance alone (in other words, just being physically in the
   6. AIT Lab Orientation         room) is not considered engagement. You will receive full
                                  points by being engaged with the content. This engagement

                                  We have purposefully designed this course in a way
                                  where coming to class and participating will lead to the
                                  most learning. We do not have a textbook nor will the
                                  posted PowerPoints provide you with all the content
necessary to meet the course objectives.
That said, we understand that coming to class can be difficult for a myriad of reasons.
You can earn missed engagement points (2 per class) by completing an assignment
(due in hard copy the week after the missed class.) It is your responsibility to email the
Yeji for the assignment; they will not email you about it. Expect the assignment to take

“Your kids are going to stare. And that's perfectly okay ... If you tell
  them not to stare, or discourage them from asking questions because
  you think it might upset us, you're teaching them that looking
  different is something to be ashamed of. It's not.” Stella Young
 approximately 1.5 hours to complete. You may complete the corresponding out-of-class
 assignment 4 times throughout the semester. More than 6 absences will result in an
 automatic loss of a letter grade.
 If you are tardy (arriving later than 8:10) or leave early (leaving before 9:10), regardless of
 reason, you will lose one attendance point. Do not ask us, “Is it okay if I leave early?” or “Will
 I miss anything important?” If your circumstances require your absence or if you have other
 obligations that you must meet, we will understand but will not excuse your departure or
 tardiness.
 2. Content Responses: 24 points. The class is designed to move quickly in order to cover
     all the content. In order for you to be successful in this endeavor, it is imperative that you
     access all the content necessary prior to class.
 3. What I May Want to Be When I Grow Up - Teacher Edition: 15 points. This
     assignment requires you to think about where you are in terms of your career plans. Why
     do you want (or not want) to be a teacher? Have you ever considered working with people
     diagnosed with disabilities/teaching special education? Why or why not? Write a brief
     paper (double-spaced, 2-3 pages) or record a brief video (less than 4 minutes) about
     what you may want to be when you grow up (in regard to teaching and people with
     disabilities), your experiences with people with disabilities, and the learning needs you
     currently have. A rubric is provided on Canvas and will be discussed in class. You may
     choose to complete this assignment orally in person; email Catherine to set up a time to
     do this.
 4. Exams: 30 points. As you may have noted from the syllabus thus far, a lot of this class is
     about your attitudes, beliefs, etc. That said, there is some concrete knowledge we want
     you to have about special education and/or disabilities. You will have two exams. You will
     take these exams on Canvas, and they will not be cumulative. You have two chances to
     take each exam; your highest score will be recorded.
 5. Exceptionality Matrix: 10 points. You will complete a matrix for most exceptionality
     types after accessing the content and during class lectures, activities, etc. This
     resource will cover accommodations teachers make to help students with specific

   exceptionalities succeed in school,
   implications across the lifespan, and
   things people should know about these
   exceptionalities. Many students
   complete this work during class time. It
   will be graded on overall completeness.
6. Assistive and Instructional
   Technology Lab visit: 10 points. A
   site visit to the Assistive and
   Instructional Technology (AIT) Lab in
   SZB 518e will acquaint you with the
   use of assistive technology (AT) across
   a number of settings for individuals with
   special needs.Specific information will
   be posted on Canvas regarding how to
   sign up for the orientations. After
   completing the orientation, turn in the
   AIT Lab Orientation Site Visit Form (on
   Canvas) and upload a screen shot indicating you finished the online survey. You may
   choose to turn in the form electronically or as a hard copy. You may (and are
   encouraged to) turn this assignment in as soon as you complete it. A rubric is
   provided on Canvas.
7. Service Learning Project (SLP): 40 points Special education is an incredibly
   diverse field. No amount of reading or lecture can make the field of special education
   come “alive.” Therefore, you need to spend some time knee-deep in the field. You
   must spend 10 hours in the field. You are responsible for scheduling and fulfilling the
   10 hours.
• You can meet the SLP requirement in a variety of ways, including:
    • Volunteering with a variety of organizations (see list on Canvas)
    • Observing relevant school settings or community settings (e.g., special education
          classrooms, job sites, group homes)
    • Shadowing/interviewing an individual in a position of interest to you (e.g.,
          audiologist, counselor/social worker, physical therapist, speech and language
          pathologist, job coach, special education teacher)

You will indicate your plan for completing your 10 hours of service learning by submitting
the Service Learning Project Plan form (worth 10 points).
You will complete a Service Learning Verification Log (worth 30 points) to indicate
when and where you completed your 10 hours.
8. Final Reflection Paper: 15 points. This assignment will have you apply two
    practices that we believe great teachers (and students and people, in general) do
    consistently: a) reflect and b) identify what you still need to learn. For your final
    assignment in this class, write a short paper (2-3 pages) or record a brief video (4
    minutes or less) identifying at least two “big ideas” that you have learned from this
    course regarding teaching and/or working with students and/or adults with disabilities
    and any gaps in your knowledge that remain. A rubric is available on Canvas and will
    be discussed in class. You may choose to complete this assignment orally in person;
    email Catherine to set up a time to do this.

Course Policies
Academic Integrity: Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas
Honor Code: “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values
of the University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT.
ALD 322                                             SZB 104                                           6

Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous
class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to
academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at
the following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Religious Holidays: A student who is absent from a class for the observance of a religious holy
day may complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence, if proper notice
has been given in writing via email to Dr. Tackett.
Emergency Evacuations: In light of an emergency, please familiarize yourself with all exit
doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door
may not be the one you used when entering the building. In the event of an evacuation, follow
our instructions. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services
office.
Personal Pronoun Use: Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with
respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics,
sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the
instructor with the student’s legal name. We will gladly honor your request to address you by an
alternate name or gender pronoun.
Behavior Concerns: If you are concerned about any individual’s behavior in class, please
contact us and/or call the Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050.
Health and self-care: It is important that we take care of ourselves inside and outside of class
and in our life by learning how to care for our mind, body, and spirit. Toward that end, there are
many different kinds of support services on campus. If you are concerned about yourself or a
friend who is struggling, the UT CMHC is a helpful resource for getting access to campus-based
support. https://cmhc.utexas.edu/
