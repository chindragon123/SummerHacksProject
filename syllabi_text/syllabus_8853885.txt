U.S. Cultural Landscapes and Ethnographic Methods
What is a cultural landscape and how can landscape and building elements narrate unique
histories of people and place? This class is organized around discrete methods used to
investigate the history of everyday places. This includes archival research (architectural
plans, town plats, aerial photographs, Sanborn maps, city directories, building permits),
and architectural analysis (walking a building plan, and analyzing buildings in situ using
Google Maps and on-site observation). A fundamental premise of this class is that spatial
research (of buildings, places, and cities) is inherently social research (of people as
envisioners and users of space). Thus, we fold ‘light ethnography’ (site observation,
informal conversations, and formal interviews) into our methodological toolkit. These
research methods will be used to address the form, style, and context of buildings types
and landscape elements at multiple scales—from the assembling of the American grid to
the building and inhabitation of individuals’ workers cottages—to examine 19th and 20th
century U.S. built environment history. The American landscape, i.e. bungalows,
shopping malls, libraries, courthouses, plazas, apartments, the grid, is a composite of
overlapping building types and landscape elements that embody social, political, and
cultural processes. Our micro exploration of one building type or landscape element
points toward the larger histories, identities, and cultural transformations of individuals
who are often excluded from canonical histories. Each student will conduct a research
project that examines one building or landscape element in Austin using the mixed
methods explored in class. We will workshop possible arguments related to this building
in class as a group and approach class projects in an experimental fashion that promotes
critical processes rather than finalized products.
Course Goals:
* reading buildings in their spatial context
* using archival sources (maps, deeds, wills, directories)
* critical engagement with city through observation, mapping, interviews
* social interpretations of architectural representations
*repeating methodological inquiry, “how would we research this?”
*spatial detective


                                                                         Lopez / Fall 2018 / pg. 2
Course Requirements:
1. Class Attendance and Readings: Students are expected to attend classes regularly and
to discuss the readings. Since we do not meet the final week of class, only one absence is
permitted. Please contact me ahead of class if you have to miss more class due to a
medical issue. More than one unexcused absence will automatically lower your grade by
one whole letter.
* See Canvas website for syllabus, handouts and readings, all materials under “module.”
2. There are weekly course assignments that revolve around one building or a particular
landscape element. Throughout the class students research the history and meaning of
one building. Each week (see below) spells out the assignment. The reading load is light
on purpose to give students the opportunity to do research.
3. Quick Building History or/and Interview with local resident/shop owner for Tour 2:
city directories and Sanborns, analysis of the building itself, any relevant context.
4. Context Workshop Presentation: During the last 3 weeks of class, students will present
their one building for 5-7 minutes and we discuss it as a group for 10. Students will use a
template for presenting that I provide in advance. We will brainstorm how to turn each
site into a full fledge research project, what arguments can be made? How would we
structure the research? What is the context at hand?
5. Urban Drift II and Reflection Piece: see last week for full explanation. This is a long,
smart, letter to me and to your future-self describing the content and take-aways of the
course, and the meaning of the built environment as you see it.
*there are THREE urban walking tours during class time.

Exploration: Context 3 Workshop (Built Environment Argument, Austin Context)
Assignment: 6 or so students will present their site, they will end with inquietudes and
questions, and as a class we will brainstorm how to push the argument and context of the
exploration further. How can this group build upon the previous two discussions?
Assignment for everybody: Derive II. After you finish the derive, take time to reflect on
how your experience of the surrounding landscape compared with the first time you did
an urban drift/derive. From this comparative place, reflect on your experiences in this
class. Write an INFORMAL (informal does not mean unedited, it means loose and
experimental, but still smart, tight, good writing) 5-page double-spaced reflection piece
on how you currently think about the built environment, on aspects of doing built
environment research that you like (and what is of value?), that you question (and what
seem problematic?), on what your current burning questions are. How did you think
about the built environment before this class started? You may write this up as an op-ed
style narrative, “Reflecting on the built environment as a Graduate Student of _____” or
as a letter to me, or your future self. Make it clear who this write-up is intended for.
