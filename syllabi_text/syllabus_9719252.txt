Course Material
Required materials include a calculator and the course packet. The course packet is available from the
GSB Copy Center. The recommended (not required) textbook is Horngren's Cost Accounting: A
Managerial Emphasis (16th Edition) by Datar and Rajan.
Course Description
Cost accounting systems provide valuable information for management planning and control.
Organizations rely on accurate cost information to decide on which products to keep and which products
to discontinue, for assessing productivity improvements and for performance evaluation and control. An
improperly designed cost accounting system can lead to costly errors in decision-making.
    Intense competition in product markets has forced firms to look inward to become more cost-efficient.
Tracing various resource costs accurately to products has become increasingly important as product
                                                     1


margins are squeezed. Manufacturing environments have also undergone significant changes. To support
decision-making in these environments, cost accounting systems also need to be redesigned.
    Through a number of case studies supplemented by lectures, this course exposes students to recent
advances in cost accounting, and highlights important inputs into the design of cost systems. The cases
cover a variety of decision-making settings and illustrate the role of cost information in these settings.
    Course objectives are:
1. To develop an understanding for the important characteristics of good cost systems.
2. To analyze the role of cost information in a variety of management decisions such as pricing, product
    mix, improving productivity, product design, and performance measurement.
Grading
Your performance in this course will be evaluated under the following model:
        Exam 1                                                       75 points
        Exam 2                                                       75 points
        Final Comprehensive Exam                                    150 points
        Homework Case Reports                                        30 points
        Participation                                                20 points
        Total                                                       350 points
There will be no opportunity to raise your course average or grade by doing "extra credit" work during or
after the semester.
Beginning in Fall 2009, The University of Texas at Austin permits plus/minus grading—that is, A,
A-, B+, B, B-, C+, etc., for all courses in which grades are awarded, including undergraduate as
well as graduate courses. To foster consistency in grading across sections of ACC 359/ACC 387.1, the
faculty have adopted plus/minus grading as the standard for all sections of the course. We believe that
plus/minus grading permits us to better distinguish gradations in performance and provide better
feedback to students on their performance.
In accordance with the Accounting Department Grade Policy/Guideline for the Core PPA courses,
Final Course Grades will be assigned to achieve a final class average GPA between 3.2 and 3.4,
inclusive.
Individual Case Homework
Every student is required to produce a short report for each case (not longer than one page). The reports
should address the following questions: ”What are the main issues in the case and how can these issues
be addressed?” The goal of the homework reports is to ensure that students have read each case and
understand the problems studied in the case.
Students have to upload the homework case reports on Canvas no later than 11:59pm on the day
before the case is discussed (e.g. the deadline for the Giberson’s Glass Studio case is 11:59pm on
Monday, September 2th). No late homework will be accepted. Canvas will not allow you to submit your
homework after the deadline. Assignments submitted in hardcopy to the professor and assignments
emailed to the professor or to the TAs will not be accepted. Homework will be graded on a scale of 2
(reasonable effort), 1 (not a good effort), and 0 (not turned in). Your two lowest homework scores will be
dropped. Verbal collaboration (i.e., talking about the assignment) on homework is allowed. However, the
prepared assignment should be your own work (do not borrow, copy or transfer answers or files from
anyone else). For classes in which there is no case discussion, you do not need to prepare a case report.
                                                        2


Class participation
Evaluating class participation is necessarily a subjective exercise. If you add to the discussion or ask
relevant questions about the material, I will evaluate you generously. If you never participate, I will
evaluate you accordingly. Any exceptional participation will be rewarded through this portion of your
grade. Any unprofessional or disruptive behavior in class will result in a reduction of this portion of your
grade.
Exams
Exams will be individually-completed closed-book exams. The exams will consist of problems, essay
questions, and short answer questions. You may bring a non-programmable calculator to the exams.
No make-up exams will be given. Medical emergencies and family emergencies are the only valid reasons
for missing an exam. In such instances, you must provide supporting documentation (e.g., signed note
from your physician). If you miss one of the two midterm exams and you have a valid and documented
reason for missing it, your final exam will replace the missing midterm exam grade. For example, if you
have 120 out of 150 points in the final (which is 120/150 = 80%), you get 0.8*75 = 60 points for the
missing midterm. If you do not have a valid and documented reason for missing an exam, you will receive
a zero on the exam.
The date for our final exam will be announced later. The final exam will cover all topics in the course (i.e.,
it is comprehensive).
Regrade requests for the midterm exams must be submitted to me in writing no later than 5 business days
after the midterm exam grades have ben posted. After the regrade period, only totaling errors will be
adjusted for.
The grade of the final exam, if better, will be averaged with the total of the two midterm exam grades and
will replace the total midterm exam grade. For example, if you have 40 and 60 points in the two midterm
exams and 140 points in the final exam, then your total midterm points will be changed from 100 to 120.
Of course, if the total of your two midterm exam grades is better than your final exam grade, then your
total midterm points remain unchanged. This gives everyone a final opportunity to improve their overall
grade.
Text and Problems
I will sometimes suggest homework problems from the Datar and Rajan textbook in class. I do not collect
or grade these problems. The solutions to the suggested problems will be made available. If you are
having trouble understanding a homework problem or solution, please discuss it with the TA.
Practical Guidance: If it is in the text but I don’t assign it in a problem or cover it in class, odds are very
slim that it will be a significant component of the exam. Budget your time accordingly.

                                             Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date

                                     Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in
the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at http://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-
Ethics. By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all faculty responsibilities described there. By
enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all student responsibilities described there. If the
application of the Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear in any
way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course
and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, the integrity of
the University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. You should refer to the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/ to access the official University policies and procedures on
scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
                                                Campus Safety
