Course Overview
Hello and welcome! I am delighted you have chosen to join our journey of discovery
into the business of entertainment. The class is an overview of the economics of
film, television and content creation and the fundamental structures that support
those industries. It is focused on historical, present and emerging practices from the
perspective of the major motion picture studios, platforms (Netflix y’all), and
independents concentrating on the legal, business, practical, strategic, economic and
business models – “follow the money” - that drive show business. Wherever your
future might lie this is essential knowledge even if you consider yourself to be solely
a ‘creative.’ Don’t fear the numbers – if you graduated high school you have the
required math skills, I promise. The class will include exposure to the critical
practical expertise – intellectual property, rights, talent deals, contractual
relationships - required to satisfy the multi-faceted demands of producing content
in the ever-changing media landscape. Why and how are studio films greenlit and
how do we determine their success? What are the challenges facing the
independent industry in the era of Netflix? You will be expected to know how to
secure underlying rights to material so that you can make your own content. In
addition, the disrupting influence of technological advances, changing consumer
habits and the rise of ‘international’ will be analyzed as well as the tensions between
content/distribution, business/creative, and risk/reward, to name but a few of the
paradigms that are at the core of understanding the eternal beating heart of the
entertainment industry. Know the future before it happens – and history helps here
- and you will be well placed to position yourself where career opportunities lie. I
know, your itching to make something, to create, and you will… armed with the
business fundamentals that will make that possible and allow your talent to shine.
And let’s enjoy the process and have some fun learning.

Assignments
Per the Canvas syllabus dates you can instantly access, you will find written
assignments are due to be posted onto Canvas no later than midnight the day before

Canvas no later than midnight on the Tuesday immediately before the next Class).
Please do not submit printed material unless specifically requested. Make sure your

on the submission itself. Extensions will be granted depending on the
circumstances: please notify me via text or email before the deadline so that the
matter may be discussed.
Special Guest Speakers
Mostly it’s just me. Yup, that’s mostly all. From time to time industry professionals
will be scheduled to offer their insights and personal experiences. Owing to
unpredictable schedules, there may be last minute changes which will be
communicated to all students via Canvas. Bear with the process, it’s just the way it
works when asking favors of busy, successful individuals. Please research the
speakers, companies, and their work ahead of time so that you are prepared to
ask them questions. This is a unique opportunity for you to speak directly with
professionals so being prepared is the best use of your time to intelligently
impress your future mentors. These visits are highly valuable and actively
participating in the Q&A for each speaker is highly recommended.
Absences/Tardy
See above in “Assignments.” If you have a legitimate scheduling issue please contact
me prior to class via email, text, or a phone call to the office. Unexcused absence
from more than one (1) class will result in a deduction of up to 5 points from your
overall grade for each individual absence. Likewise, being tardy or leaving early
after the first such instance, will also, at my discretion, result in the deduction of
overall grade points up to the same level as an absence.

    •   Current State of the film and media industry

Some history of the studios, how the system works, who the players are and how the

that is being played.
CLASS #1A - ARTICLE DISCUSSION (Asynchronous 60 minutes): Each week an

    •   Studio Revenues
    •   Studio Costs
    •   Platform Business Models
Everyone talks success and failure in the movie business but the only genuine number
that matters is box office – that is the key to revenues across all media and all other
numbers, reported or not, are conjecture, myth building and spin. Let’s grapple with
the realities and how to interpret the data for yourself so that you can make an
informed judgement of your own and enjoy the rest for what it is: BS. How do the
studios decide what films to make – at what budget? – and what is the safe zone for
them? Where do they get their production money? How to read a studio accounting
statement. And why the platforms represent a paradigm shift economically in an era
of data analytics that disrupts the old studio theatrical paradigms.
CLASS #2A - ARTICLE DISCUSSION (Asynchronous 60 minutes)
CLASS #2B - COMPARABLES ANALYSIS FOR STUDIO FILMS (Asynchronous 1-hour
recorded lecture)
Now that we know the revenues and cost structures for the studios, an
asynchronous recorded lecture on Canvas on the basic financial comparables
analysis that studios run to facilitate the greenlit process. Where is the power
between Production, Marketing and Distribution? Comparables analysis is flawed –
see The Hangover as an example – but follows the golden rule of risk/reward for
studios executives: job one, don’t get fired.
=================================================================
CLASS #3 - DEVELOPMENT (BUSINESS)
Suggested Reading Assignment. In advance of Class #3, please review and be
familiar with the assigned option and purchase agreement handout posted to

First you must storm the castle: getting inside the entertainment system as an
outsider. Once inside the castle, what do you have to sell? Articles, books, life stories,

video games, graphic novels are all the basis of content. It is the single most important
foundational basis of content creation in any media that the underlying rights to
material be secured that allow for the show to be produced. You should know how to
secure those rights – what specific rights, how material and creatives are paid, the
power of credits, etc. Empower yourself with the most practical of skills.
CLASS #3A - ARTICLE DISCUSSION (Asynchronous 60 minutes):
=================================================================
CLASS #4 - DEVELOPMENT (LEGAL)
Suggested Reading Assignment. In advance of Class #4, please read Chapter 17
“Copyright” and Chapter 18 “Right of Publicity” of The Biz by Schuyler M. Moore, 5th

business and legal perspective:
•   Copyright & Trademarks
•   Invasion of Privacy & Defamation
•   Rights of Publicity
•   Defenses - Fair Use / Consent / Truth
•   E&O / Bond / The Guilds
So, you have stormed the castle and secured the underlying rights, what now?
Understand the complexities of the legal framework within which production operates
so that the potholes on the road ahead can be foreseen, swerved around and
successfully powered thru and over. Solving the legals to getting it made.
CLASS #4A - ARTICLE DISCUSSION (Asynchronous 60 minutes):
CLASS #4B – REMUNERATION AND CONTINGENT COMPENSATION FOR CREATIVE
TALENT (Asynchronous 1-hour recorded lecture)
Your script is ready so let’s assemble the package. How are creative talent paid? An
asynchronous recorded lecture on Canvas on the basic deal terms for remuneration for
creative talent with a specific emphasis on the various definitions of adjusted gross
receipts that separate top talent from the humble net profit participants and, of
course, some SAG-AFTRA details.

Rebates, Refundable Credits, and Transferable Credits. Production incentives are the
unseen and unheralded grease that oils the engine behind getting a greenlight.
Understand the power of financial leverage that incentives afford equity financiers and
