INTRODUCTION: This course examines the evidence for the origin and evolution of humans with
particular emphasis placed on reconstructing the paleobiology and behavior of extinct hominins. Lectures
will draw upon a diverse range of disciplines (anatomy, archaeology, ecology, ethology, genetics,
geology, paleontology) and integrate these data into a framework for understanding the history of this
unusual group of primates. Laboratories provide the student with an opportunity to examine firsthand the
fossil evidence for human evolution.
REQUIRED READINGS: The following textbooks are required for the course:
 Klein, R.G. 2009. The Human Career. The University of Chicago Press. 3rd edition.
 Kappelman, J. 2007. Virtual Laboratories for Physical Anthropology. 4th edition. Labs are available
     online from UT’s TXShop website, and the instructions are available on the Canvas course website.
     VLabs can be used with these browsers: Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer (but not Google
     Chrome). If you already have a copy from a previous course, that will work. For purchase, go to the
     TXShop website: Virtual Laboratories for Physical Anthropology
 Sourcebook and laboratory materials. These materials include articles from the primary literature
     along with the laboratory readings and assignments and are available on the Canvas course website.
REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING: The course material will be introduced during lecture. Weekly
laboratory problem sets will serve to highlight specific topics. The final grade for the course (no + or -)
will be calculated as follows:

ANTHROPOLOGY 348 COURSE POLICY ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Students who cheat not only cheat themselves but also cheat other students and harm the reputation of the
University. Students in this course are expected to adhere to the highest standard of academic and
personal integrity. Each student is expected to compete honestly and fairly with his or her peers. All
students are harmed by unethical behavior by any student. Under this course’s honor system, students
must not tolerate unethical behavior by their fellow students. A student who knows of unethical behavior
of another student is required to take the steps necessary to expose this behavior. Please see UT’s policy
on Student Discipline and Conduct.
Unless otherwise specified, the work that you complete in this course must be entirely your own. If
you do not think you can follow this simple rule, please do not take this course.
You ARE NOT permitted to:
  - copy or reproduce by any means the exam questions and answers
  - discuss, request, or share any information about the exams in any possible venue (e.g., informal
       hallway chat, websites, forums, Facebook, GroupMe, TM, etc.) with anyone who is not the
       professor or teaching assistant
  - have more than two attempts on each exam
  - plagiarize or dishonestly cite other authors or sources
  - collaborate on, or discuss, request, or share any information about the laboratory assignments in any
       possible venue (e.g., informal hallway chat, websites, forums, Facebook, GroupMe, TM, etc.) with
       anyone who is not the professor or teaching assistant
  - submit lab assignments for another student
  - submit any lab more than once
A word of caution: Because the exams are “open” (i.e., can be taken at any time), and can be taken twice
(the higher score counts for the grade), and the labs are open book take-home assignments, it is too easy
for chat and study groups to quickly shift into platforms for sharing answers, and this behavior is against
the course rules (see above). Do not fall into this trap because it only takes a single honest person to
expose cheating, and a student who knows of unethical behavior of another student is required to take the
steps necessary to expose this behavior. The best path to the successful completion of this course is to
do your own work. All questions about the lab assignments and exams should be directed to the
professor and teaching assistants, NOT to your fellow students.
                    This course has a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for cheating.
Any student found cheating (see above) will have their case directed to the UT Dean of Students
and Office of Student Judicial Services with the recommendation of an F in the course and the
potential for additional disciplinary action.
I have read and understand the above rules and agree to follow these course and University
policies.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS
Laboratory Assignments
Weekly laboratories provide the student with a hands-on examination and evaluation of the fossil record
for human origins and evolution. The labs provide an in-depth study of a particular topic presented in that
week’s lecture. Each of 11 labs consists of a 30-45 minute lecture that introduces the problem that in turn
is followed by about 30-45 minutes of data collection. In order to use lab time efficiently, students must
come to lab having already read the lab materials and familiarized themselves with the assignment.
In many cases students will be able to complete much of the laboratory assignment write-up during the
lab time. The TA will instruct the class as to whether or not it is permissible for students to work together
on data collection and write up; if the TA does not explicitly state that cooperation is permitted, students
should assume that all work must be their own. Assignments are due at the beginning of the following
lab. Extension requests are subject to the rules as presented below.
Examinations
There are two hourly exams in the course. The first part of each exam is a computer-based multimedia
test that is administered during regular lab times. This test includes materials from the textbook, labs, and
lectures. The exam can be attempted twice, with the highest of the two grades counting toward the final
grade.
A take-home open book essay question is assigned with each exam. It has a length limit of five pages and
must include appropriate citations. Students have at least one week to complete the essay and submit it via
email.
eFossils Team Term Project
The fossil record for human evolution has expanded dramatically over the past quarter century and it is
now difficult to easily present these numerous findings. Prof. Kappelman and his team of developers have
built a website, eFossils, that offers a useful means for aggregating these findings within a “map-app.”
Students will be assigned to teams, given a fossil site, and then work together to investigate the subtopics
(hominins, archaeology, fauna, geology, paleoecology). The results will be posed to eFossils. Student
team members will earn publication authorship for the assignment. Each team will briefly present its
findings in class during the last week of the semester.
There is almost no work in any of the sciences that today represents the work of a single person, and
paleoanthropology with its large teams is an excellent case in point of how scientists do their work. This
term-length assignment offers a realistic experience about how team-based science is conducted.
Class and Lab Attendance and Participation
Attendance in class and lab is recorded. Everyone has something to contribute, and participation counts!
Extra Credit
Explore UT. It is critical that scientists engage with the public, and students have the opportunity to
volunteer at Explore UT as part of Prof. Kappelman’s lab group. In addition, students are always
welcome to volunteer in the lab and participate in the various ongoing digital imaging projects, many of
which are designed for the public (e.g., eSkeletons, eFossils, eLucy).
In the news. You probably already know that paleoanthropology is an active field. You can earn extra
credit by submitting a brief paragraph that links to and describes a new discovery in human evolution:
 Subject line: “In the news by [your name]”
 Body: brief paragraph describing the finding and its significance/relationship to human evolution and
     providing the URL link.

A 348 LECTURE AND READINGS SCHEDULE
Below are the reading assignments from the two required texts used in this course (Klein's The
Human Career and Kappelman's Virtual Laboratories). In addition, there are weekly laboratory
readings posted to Canvas that must be completed before you attend your assigned lab.
In addition to weekly readings from the textbook and Virtual Labs, we assign weekly readings
from primary science journals that provide more detailed information about discoveries or ideas
in the field. These articles will be posted each week on Canvas. A few questions that will aid
your understanding of these articles will be included with each week’s readings. These readings
are an important addition to studying for the two hourly exams and essays and can also
assist you with the weekly lab assignment writeups.
The “Klein” textbook is given by chapter number and “VL” refers to lab number from the
Virtual Laboratories. Items in italics are University deadlines.

INTRODUCTION TO THE LABORATORIES
The laboratories are designed to provide you with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with the
materials and methods of paleoanthropology. Because this experience is vital to a better understanding of
human evolution, the grade you receive in lab will account for 30% of your total grade in the class. It is
essential that you attend lab. The following guidelines will be followed for lab sections:
     1)   All lab assignments are due at the beginning of the following week's lab.
     2)   NO late lab homework is accepted unless documented by a verifiable excuse (see below). If you
         anticipate a difficulty ahead of time, or have a documented conflict as a consequence of a
         University activity, you should contact the TA or professor ASAP.
     3) You must attend the lab section for which you are registered. If an unforeseen problem arises and
         you cannot attend your lab, talk to the TA in order to see if you can attend a different session.
         Your lab assignment will still be due at the beginning of your registered lab section.
     4) While we encourage you to interact and exchange ideas with other students, the lab assignments
         that you submit must be your own work.

DISABILITIES, EXTENSIONS, and DROPS and INCOMPLETES
Disabilities
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of
Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259.
Extension requests
Requests for an extension for missed work because of a sanctioned University activity, documented
illness, family-related emergency, or death in the family will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but
whatever the circumstance, documentation is required. If you are unable to document your excuse, you
will not be permitted to make up the missed work. Whatever the case – sanctioned University activity,
documented illness, family-related emergency, or death in the family – full documentation is required.
If you find yourself so sick that you must miss an exam or lab submission, you should see a doctor, and if
you do, the doctor will give you a written excuse.
Permission to make up missed exams or labs requires a completed Extension Permission Request Form
(available on the Canvas class website) and supporting documentation (see below). The extension request,
consisting of a completed Extension Permission Request form along with supporting documentation, must
be submitted no later than one week following the missed exam or lab deadline date (e.g., if you miss a
Friday deadline date, the extension request form and documentation must be received no later than the
following Thursday).
Supporting documentation:
         If an illness, a medical excuse documented by a letter from your doctor;
         If a family emergency, written documentation;
         If a family death, an obituary or death certificate;
         If a University-sanctioned activity, a letter from the director of the organization delivered to us
          BEFORE the event since these events are scheduled months in advance; and
         If a work-related conflict, a note from your supervisor.
If a scheduling conflict arises from work or some other issues that will cause you to miss a deadline,
please inform us as early as possible so we can assess the validity of the conflict and make any necessary
arrangements. If you do not tell us ahead of time about a scheduled event, you will not receive permission
to make up the missed work.
The extension request must receive approval before any missed work can be made up. If you cannot
provide independent documentation that we can verify, the extension request will not be approved. We
check on all excuses by calling the doctor, supervisor, family member, and faculty supervisor or coach.
During the days when a completed extension request is under evaluation, you should continue to meet the
exam and lab schedule.
Drops and Incompletes
If you find that you are unable to complete the course, you may obtain a drop with a “Q” if you file the
appropriate paperwork (available from your dean’s office) by the required University deadline date.
An incomplete after the deadline date can generally only be granted for a serious medical condition as
documented by a letter from your doctor. In only exceptional cases are other excuses considered
legitimate grounds for an incomplete, and these excuses require approval from your dean’s office.
