Unique #80615
Summer 2019
Prerequisite: One of the following: English 303C (or 603A), Rhetoric and Writing 306,
306Q, or Tutorial Course 303C (or 603A).
Course Description
This team-taught, self-paced course in the American literary tradition will explore
historical and thematic connections between writers and works from the 17 to the   th
21 centuries. In doing so, the course will also provide a variety of opportunities for
   st
students to increase their enjoyment of and engagement with literature, as well as their
skills as analytical readers and writers. After an introductory unit in which students will
be introduced to some key terms and methods for reading literature more skillfully and
enjoyably, the course will be organized historically and divided into five units. Although
the readings will proceed more or less chronologically, each unit will include one or
more recent or contemporary work. Students will be encouraged throughout the
course to make thematic connections between the literature and historical
circumstances of earlier periods and the cultural products and social issues of
contemporary life.
Course Objectives
This course will: introduce students to the study of American literature; model methods
of literary and cultural interpretation; help students to improve their critical thinking and
reading skills. Please note: E316M may be used to fulfill the Humanities component of
the University Core Curriculum. As a result, the course addresses the following four
core objectives established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board:
communication skills; critical thinking skills; personal responsibility; and social
responsibility. In addition, this course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United
States. Cultural Diversity courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the
variety and richness of the American cultural experience. Accordingly, and in keeping
with the core objectives of the course, our lectures will place particular emphasis on
the exploration of what the assigned readings communicate about the values and
choices of different peoples and groups living in different social and historical
circumstances.

Requirements and Grading
Weekly Tutorial Participation (20% of final grade)
Students are required to take part in weekly, online, 10-minute tutorials with their
Teaching Assistants during each of the four full weeks of the summer session (starting
with the week of June 10). These tutorials will typically meet on Thursday, Friday, or
Saturday. Tutorial participation will be measured by, among other things, quality of
insights, familiarity with the material, responsiveness to the ideas and comments of
their Teaching Assistant, and willingness to take intellectual risks. These sessions are
much more than virtual office hours; they are an opportunity to show engagement with
the course texts and lectures and to take part in a one-on-one interpretive exchange.
TAs will contact the students in their sections ten days to two weeks before the official
June 6 start of the summer term to explain how to log in for tutorials and to establish a
tutorial schedule. Students will select their weekly tutorial time slot from among their
TA's available hours and then be responsible for attending the tutorial at that time. NB:
A missed tutorial appointment will result in 0/50 points for the week. Graded tutorials
begin with Unit I, but we are asking that you take part in an ungraded 5-minute tutorial
between June 6 and June 9 to meet your TA and orient you to the format and
expectations of the subsequent graded tutorials.
Reading and Lecture Quizzes (20% of final grade)
Each unit will culminate in a 10-minute quiz over the unit's readings and lectures. Quiz
questions will be multiple choice or true/false. Each quiz will consist of 10 questions
and be worth 50 points.
Visions and Revisions (20% of final grade)


In addition to tutorials and quizzes, students will be asked to complete four end-of-unit
writing exercises. Each of these short critical and/or creative assignments is worth 50
points. There is an optional, fifth "Visions and Revisions" worth 10 extra credit points.
Final Examination (40% of final grade)
There will be a three-hour, cumulative online final examination. The examination will
have three parts: 1) a 10-question quiz over Unit V's readings and lectures (50
points); 2) a CRIT of a poem not included on the syllabus (150 points); and 3) a series
of analyses of passages from across the syllabus (200 points). Details on the final
examination will follow shortly.
Grading Rubric
Letter grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric:
A = 940-1000
A- = 900-939
B+ = 870-899
B = 840-869
B- = 800-839
C+ = 770-799
C = 740-769
C- = 700-739
D+ = 670-699
D = 640-669
D- = 600-639
F = 0-599
NB: Final grades will not be rounded up.

Note: Required readings and videos for each lecture are listed in the Course Schedule
below. Most readings appear in the Norton Anthology of American Literature, Shorter
Eighth Edition; Norton Anthology page numbers are given in parentheses after each

it. At the same time, respect for the course community and one another’s experiences
and viewpoints is paramount.
