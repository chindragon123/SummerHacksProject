COURSE CATALOG DESCRIPTION:
Solving economic problems related to construction and engineering; construction project management
techniques; characteristics of construction organizations, equipment, and methods.
PREREQUISITES: Mathematics 408D, CE333T
COURSE OBJECTIVES:
This class is an introduction to project management and economics, which in real life are closely related
topics. It is hard to be a good project manager without a working knowledge of finance and cash flow. And
while some people get really good at economic calculations, applying the results usually takes some project
management skill, whatever the domain. As such, my two main learning objectives for the course are simple
but profound:
    1. Learn the basics of how a project comes together (time line, main components, participating
         organizations, etc.) Applications will be construction focused, but many of the ideas are
         generalizable.
    2. Learn to be smart about money on projects (investment, budgeting, risk and decision making).
By taking this class you will be able to:
    1. Define and describe the main elements in the project time and as well as the major sub-elements
    2. Apply net present value and related concepts to the analysis of cash flows, including selection of
         alternatives and life-cycle costing (this is the big one for this class)
    3. Develop elementary project schedules and perform basic scheduling calculations
    4. Estimate construction costs based on square footage and quantities
    5. Identify risks in each phase and apply sensitivity analysis to quantify risks in cost and time where
         possible/practicable.

NOTE: All assigned readings are required to be completed BEFORE class. As I expect you to be familiar
with them, I have every right to ask you questions about the reading during class time.
There are two required textbooks for the course. The first is available at the bookstore:
     Newnan, Lavelle, and Eschenbach. (2017). Engineering-Economic Analysis. 13th Edition. Oxford
        University Press, New York/Oxford. (Note: 9th,10th, 11th and 12th editions are ok as substitutes).
The second textbook is available free online! We will use it as a general reference.
     Hendrickson and Au. (2000/3). Project Management for Construction. Available at
        https://www.cmu.edu/cee/projects/PMbook/
Other reading material will be distributed on Canvas or in class.
GRADING:
Grade components will be weighted as follows:
        Quiz 1                            05%
        Midterm 1                         25%
        Midterm 2                         25%
        Final Exam                        20% (seen note on optional final)
        Homework                          20% (individual weights vary by size of assignment)
        Class Participation               05% (attendance)
                                          100%
Letter grades will be determined as follows:
        A:       grade ≥ 93%
        A-:      90% ≤ grade ≤ 92.99%
        B+:      87% ≤ grade ≤ 89.99%
        B:       83% ≤ grade ≤ 86.99%
        B-:      80% ≤ grade ≤ 82.99%
        C+:      77% ≤ grade ≤ 79.99%
        C:       73% ≤ grade ≤ 76.99%
        C-:      70% ≤ grade ≤ 72.99%
        D+:      67% ≤ grade ≤ 69.99%
        D:       63% ≤ grade ≤ 66.99%
        D-:      60% ≤ grade ≤ 62.99%
        F:       grade < 60%
Assigned grades will strictly follow calculated scores.
Exams and quizzes:
Quizzes, midterm, and final are closed book, closed note exams. I may adjust scores upward if the class
mean is low. Calculators are allowed provided you haven’t programmed them with notes. The final will
be cumulative. Other exams will cover part of the class material (subjects will be announced in class) and
motivate you to review the material to-date. Exams will include problems, definition/matching, multiple
choice, and short answer questions as appropriate to the material covered. This class has both quantitative
and qualitative elements and both will be tested.
                                                                                                           2


Quizzes, midterm and final exams will not be returned to the student. The exam solutions will be reviewed
in class. Exams can be reviewed during office hours.
Makeups exams:
If you have an excused absence, I will work with you to take a makeup exam as close as possible to the
date of the exam. If you have an excused absence that you know about ahead of time, let me know as early
as possible – my preference is for you to take the exam before others. In special cases, I will work with the
student on alternate accommodations.
Homework:
Homework consists of traditional problem sets as well as short written questions relating to the course
materials and reading. All homework should be completed using the format guidelines discussed on the
first day of class (example format will be uploaded on canvas for your reference). 10% will be deducted
from the homework score automatically for not adhering to the format. The format is for your benefit. If
the grader cannot understand your work or thought process, it can be very difficult to grade accurately.
Furthermore, if only an answer is provided, with no calculations (unless appropriate to do so, such as
multiple choice), the problem receives 0 credit.
Homework assignments should be completed individually, but I encourage study groups for discussion.
Length of homework assignments will vary, and weighting of homework grades will vary with length and
difficulty. Homework is due at the beginning of class, at 9:30am/11:00am depending on section. Late
homework will not be accepted unless there is an excused absence or it has been prearranged with me.
Written homework: Some homework write-ups are short one page or so written assignments. There will be
a write-up about every few weeks based on a short reading or response to a video. The intent is to get you
thinking about broader issues related to class materials. Write-ups will be due at the beginning of class and
serve as the basis of discussion. I will randomly call on an individual to start discussion by giving their
answers to the write-up questions.
Final Exam:
This year, the final exam will be optional. Grades without the final will be posted the last week of classes
(or as soon as possible to allow grading of the final homework). If you elect NOT to take the final, all class
scores above will be proportionally weighted to 95% and averaged with the attendance score for 100%. If
you do elect to take the final, scores will follow the table above. If you take the final exam, it will be
counted toward your final grade (i.e., if you take the final and your score lowers your grade compared to
not taking it, you must take the grade with the final).
Class Participation:
Class participation is based on attendance (see below).
GRADE DISPUTES:
You may dispute a grade within 5 calendar days from when the grade is posted or returned in class. Grade
disputes should be submitted to me, in writing, and I will determine if the request will be granted. Do not
submit re-grade requests to the grader.
When submitting grade dispute, you must put in writing (word document) what the nature of the dispute is,
along with the homework/quiz to be reviewed.
                                                                                                             3


If you have a grade dispute on an exam, please see me during office hours (or make an appointment) within
5 calendar days from when the graded exams were reviewed in class.
If you do not understand why you received a grade or what mistakes were made, please seek clarification.
Come to office hours so we can sit down and discuss the material to ensure you understand the concepts
can be as successful as possible in this course.
ATTENDANCE:
Class attendance is 5% of your grade in this course and based on attendance. Attendance in this class is
strongly encouraged. There is a lot of learning that goes on in the classroom, so I want students to attend
and participate. As such, I will take attendance with a class roster most days (you sign by your name). If
you do not want your name on this list, contact me as soon as possible to make other arrangements.
Class attendance will count towards class participation grade. Students get one unexcused absence free.
After that, each unexcused absence counts as one letter grade less towards your final score for class
participation. Please contact me ahead of the class if you need an excused absence (e.g., travel for job
interview, student activity, etc. Family fun is NOT an excused absence). If you miss a class due to illness
(or death other than your own) and were not able to contact me before class, please see me as soon as
possible with evidence of your illness.
Note 1: No ‘free’ unexcused absences are allowed on days with guest speakers (e.g., no freebies on days
when people take the time to come and speak to you!).
Note 2: extended absences without excuse are grounds for a failing grade in the course (per university
policy).
Accommodations: If you have a long-term problem or family emergency, please talk with me about it as
soon as possible so we can make mutually agreeable accommodations. It is difficult for me and generally
unfair to other students if you approach me after the fact.
Accommodations will also be made for religious observance and for military duty. See the University
policy here: http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/academic-policies-and-procedures/attendance/
EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENTS:
This is an upper division undergraduate course. At this point, I expect you to be able to learn and
assimilate materials on your own. Students are also expected to comport themselves in a professional
manner. Specific expectations for students include:
     1. Students should review course material on their own outside of class.
     2. Students should be on time to class. It can be very disruptive to other’s learning to have someone
         come in late. The attendance sheet will be passed around at the start of class. If you are not
         present to sign, you may not sign in at the end of class, unless you have already made
         accommodations with me before the class.
     3. Students should participate actively in course discussions. If you need to miss class, please inform
         the instructor ahead of time.
     4. In class, students are expected to be courteous and respectful of the views and needs of other
         students and instructors. Disruptive students will be asked to leave. Students are allowed to use
         laptops during lectures for note taking only.
     5. Students will not be engaged with their cell phones (or similarly technology) in class, and cell
         phones will be placed on silent in a bag, or turned off. If you are on your cell phone during class,
         you will receive not participation credit for that class. This is YOUR time in class and I would
         like you to get the most out of every class.
                                                                                                             4


    6. Students should work on in-class assignments as if they were job assignments. At any time, the
         instructor may call upon students to present their work to the class.
    7. Students should turn in their work on-time. In the construction industry, bids for projects are not
         accepted posted the deadline. Similarly, in this class, homework will not be accepted after the
         beginning of class on the due date.
    8. If you have a family emergency or extended problem with attending class or doing homework,
         please contact me as soon as possible so we can accommodate your needs. It is hard to do this
         after the fact!
