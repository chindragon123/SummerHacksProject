Required TEXT:             TITLE = The Maya (9th Edition, 2015)
                           AUTHORS = M. Coe and S. Houston
                           PUBLISHER = Thames & Hudson
COURSE CONTENT: This course reviews Maya civilization from archaeological and art
history perspectives. The Maya region is defined and described in order to have a common basis
for studying the civilization. Early investigations into the Maya area are briefly reviewed. A
summary of the earliest inhabitants (Paleoindian and Archaic foundations) is also presented.
The Preclassic Period (ca. 2000 BC – AD 250) is detailed as the beginnings and development of
Maya Civilization (with short comparisons & comments of neighboring societies). Early and
Late Classic Maya are reviewed for their various cultural developments, both temporal and
regional. The Terminal Classic and its related events are studied as well as adjustments by Maya
Civilization that define the Postclassic.
 The final segment of the course will inquire into Maya religion and thought as expressed
(mostly) archaeologically. A short review of current/recent archaeological projects and the
research of interest may be presented.
COURSE GRADING: Evaluation in this course will be through five tests --- please note that
there are NO MAKE-UPS. The lowest of the five grades will be dropped for the final grade
average. If a test is missed, that (missed) test becomes the lowest score.
Tests are multiple choice, true-false, and fill-in-the-blank. The tests are not cumulative, there is
no “final exam” for this course. When tests are returned, any questions or need of modification
to the evaluation must be done within two class meetings of the returned test. Test results will
not be reevaluated at the end of the semester. Any questions, confusion about the course
grading, etc. should be clarified/settled with Dr. Valdez as soon as possible.


This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and
histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
