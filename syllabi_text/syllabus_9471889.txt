        The Aztec and the Spanish empires have attracted the attention of scholars and the
public for a long time with stories of gold, human sacrifice, warfare, and the meeting of two
different civilizations. In this class we will study both empires, taking advantage of the varied
lines of evidence available for their study, especially historical and archaeological evidence, as
well as monuments and works of art. The focus of the class will be on how imperial expansion
affected the daily life of people in the Aztec empire and after the Spanish conquest. In addition
to studying the daily life of different people in these empires, we will examine some of the
themes that have fascinated both scholars and the general public, including human sacrifice,
conquest warfare, and religion. The goal of the class is to examine social and cultural
heterogeneity in both of these empires, to familiarize students with the diverse lines of evidence
we have to study these empires, and to understand processes of historical change in these two
empires.
        Prior experience in archaeology is not required to join the class.
Global Cultures flag: This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are
designed to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the
practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Students with disabilities: Any student with disabilities should talk to me as soon as possible so
that we may make arrangements that will make for a better learning experience and that will
allow the student to show his or her abilities fully. Any request for accommodations must be
made at least two weeks prior to the first exam. No last-minute requests will be honored.
                                                                                                   1


Some classroom rules:
        A. NO cellphones, laptops, newspapers, or calculators in class or during exams.
        B. You may not record lectures or take photographs during lecture. Recording of any
            of my lectures will be considered academic dishonesty and result in academic
            penalties for the students involved. I do not post lecture notes on the internet,
            although I often post the images I use in class.
        C. Academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to University rules.
Grading: Successful completion of this course will require learning from readings, lectures,
Power Point presentations, in-class exercises, and film. Topics covered in the readings and in
the classroom will, at times, be entirely different.
        I will not report or discuss grades with students over the phone or via email. Please talk
to me in person to discuss grades. This helps ensure that our conversation will remain private.
        Instructions for written exercises will be given in class. Written exercises are due at the
beginning of class.
        Students may discuss their exams with me individually. Students who request that I re-
grade their exams, must present their request in writing. If I agree to re-grade their exam,
students should be aware that their grade might suffer if I find errors that I did not find on my
first grading. Therefore, students are advised to make sure they have specific reasons why their
grade should improve before they challenge their grade.
Final grades will be calculated as follows:
1.:     Written exercises:             20%
2.:     Exam 1:                        25%
3.:     Exam 2:                        25%
4.:     Exam 3:                        30%
1. Written exercises: There will be a total of 8 short written exercises (between half a page and
one page long) during the semester. I will drop your lowest two scores and keep your 6 highest
scores when I calculate your grade in those exercises. I will provide more information on these
exercises in class.
2. Exams: There will be three exams in the semester. Exam 3 is not comprehensive. It may
include questions from previous exams only if I announce so.
                                                                                                  2


Grading Scale:
93.5 to 100 = A; 89.5 to 93.4 = A-; 86.5 to 89.4 = B+; 83.5 to 86.4 = B; 79.5 to 83.4 = B-; 76.5
to 79.4 = C+; 73.5 to 76.4 = C; 69.5 to 73.4 = C-; 66.5 to 69.4 = D+; 63.5 to 66.4 = D; 59.5 to
63.4 = D-; 59.0 and below = F.
Email rules:
        1. Email if you have a medical emergency that will prevent you from making it to an
            exam. No need to email if you will miss class, unless you miss more than two weeks.
        2. Email me if you need to see me in office hours but you have a time conflict with a
            class. Otherwise, you may just show up during office hours.
        3. Email if I ask you to email me.
        4. Do not email to continue class discussion; please use office hours. Also, if you have
            a question about the material, please bring it up in class. Other students might
            benefit from it.
        5. Do not use email to turn in assignments or to send attachments unless I specifically
            ask you to do so.
        6. My email is: chanfle@austin.utexas.edu. Before you click “send”, make sure that
