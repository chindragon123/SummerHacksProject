Overview
Information in Cyberspace (INF335) is a course designed for undergraduate students that provides an overview of
the history and social impact of Internet and Web technology. INF335 emphasizes technology self-sufficiency and
information literacy.
The purpose of this course is to prepare students to think about information technology in a critical, thoughtful
manner. The goal of this course is to pull back the curtain on some of the inner workings of information technology
and empower students to navigate confidently through information spaces in networked environments. While it
may be safe to assume the Internet will continue to exist for the foreseeable future, we can count on our
description of cyberspace changing over time. This course aims to give students the tools to think critically about
networked information communication technologies and their role as information consumers, producers, and
leaders in the evolution of cyberspace.
Objectives
In this course students will learn:
● about technical applications that make the Internet possible;
● about political, financial, and social implications of creating content on the Internet;
● how to find, evaluate, and cite Information resources on the Internet;
● how to protect content and resources from malicious attacks;
Students will enact the following learning techniques:
● reading about history and current news related to information technology;
● discussing history and current news related to information technology;
● completing hands-on projects to practice presenting and assessing information in a variety of contexts.
Prerequisites
While there are no prerequisite classes for INF335, you should know the following before taking this course:
     1. You need to contact your instructors and TAs to ask questions or get help at the first sign of trouble.
     2. You need to pay very close attention to the course home page to keep up with what's going on.
     3. You need to organize your time effectively so you can spend at least 6 hours a week working on this class.
     4. Students who are unable to motivate and organize themselves, and especially those who don't
          communicate with their instructors or TAs, tend to be unsuccessful in a virtual classroom environment.
     5. Although it is not necessary to be a computer expert to complete this course successfully, you do need to
          know the basics of operating a personal computer and navigating the Internet. You are expected to know
          how to...
              a. create folders and view the contents of a disk;
                                                                                                                    1


              b. open an application or program;
              c. send and receive e-mail;
              d. search the Internet.
     6.   submit work that meets college-level writing standards.
If you don't know how to do these things, let your instructor or TA know during the first week of class. We will be
happy to sit down and show you how to do it.
Schedule
This course consists of a number of instructional modules. A core group of these modules are required, but the last
three modules are what we call “choose your own adventure”. For the last three weeks of instruction, you will
have the ability to choose three modules from a variety of different options to complete the course. The modules
vary each semester, so see Canvas for more details on this group of assignments. Our goal is to allow you some
choice and flexibility, and the opportunity to dig into particular topics that you might find more interesting.
A group of two modules will be opened every two weeks. So, for example, on August 28th modules one and two
will open up. The first module serves as an orientation to this course; and the last module is reserved for students
to complete their final project. Below is a list of all the modules and their schedules.

● Weekly discussions
Every week, you will contribute to the online discussion forum as part of the class participation assignment. Think
of these online discussions as your chance to share what you know, ask questions, and challenge the readings just
as you would in small group discussions in class. In addition to submitting your discussion post, you are also
required to respond to two of your classmates' discussion posts with your thoughts, reactions, or contributions to
the discussion.
Original discussion submissions should be at least 150 words long (unless the discussion topic specifically states a
different length) and should make it clear to the instructor or TA that you have read the assigned reading for that
week.
Your responses to others should be at least 2 sentences long and should move the conversation forward.
Responses of "I agree. This happened to me once." Or similar short responses will not receive credit.
Please note: to make sure everyone has enough time to respond to each other’s posts, you are encouraged to
submit your discussion post as early as you could. Each weekly discussion is due on every Friday 11:59pm, and you
will need to submit your responses to others by the following Sunday at 11:59pm!
Grading: 2 points for the initial post; 1 point for each response; total of 4 points for each discussion.
● Weekly quizzes
There will be a short quiz on each module. All quizzes are open book, and the aim is not to test what you have
memorized, but to apply what you have learned and to review the material. For some questions, answers are in
the module readings. If you study the readings carefully, you are sure to know (or be able to find) the answers. For
other questions, you may need to consult external resources to be able to answer the question. The weekly quiz is
due every Sunday at 11:59pm.
You have three hours to complete each quiz. The average time to complete one quiz is about 20 minutes, so make
sure you set aside enough time to complete the quiz.
Grading: total of 4 points for each quiz.
●    Final project
For the final project, you will choose to study a topic you are interested in that relates to the broad field
of “information in cyberspace” in some way. The final project (FP) is broken down into 6 separate
assignments (FP0 - FP5) that you will need to complete at different times throughout the semester. FP0
is to select your final project topic. FP1 through FP4 involves directly relating your selected project topic
to one class module subject, helping generate content for FP5. FP5 brings together FP0 through FP4 into
a presentation. Each final project assignment is due at 11:59pm on the assigned due date.
                                                                                                                     3


Please note that you have to complete the final project in order to pass this course. If you fail to
submit the final project, you will fail the course regardless of the number of points you have
accumulated.
Here is a breakdown of the final project.

Late Assignments
It is important to complete your work on time, both so you can stay on track and so you can collaborate and
interact with your fellow students. Late assignments will not be accepted. You will receive a zero if you do not
submit your assignment on time. I use the Canvas upload time as the official time of the submission, so if you
submit your assignment 5 seconds after the deadline, Canvas will mark your assignment late and you will receive a
zero for that assignment.
Please make sure you submit your assignments well in advance; computer problems, network outages, and other
“technical” issues will not be considered a valid excuse for submitting an assignment late, so make sure you submit
your work early.
Plan ahead. This is an online course and you have a full week to ensure you complete everything on time. As there
is no scheduled class time, you must be responsible for getting work done in a timely manner. The course allows
for a lot of flexibility for you to schedule your work, so I will be very strict about excused late work.
Required Readings
All required readings for this course are available through the course modules in Canvas. Reading materials include
articles and online videos.
University Policies
● Academic Integrity
Please abide by the University’s policy on academic integrity. All work you submit must be your own. "Scholastic
dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating and plagiarism... Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or
dismissal from the University. University policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced." From: The
University of Texas: General Information, Appendix C.
                                                                                                                       4


If I find blatant plagiarism (copy and paste from Wikipedia, for example) you will be referred to Student Judicial
Services and you will fail the class. Plagiarism is my least favorite thing to deal with in this course. Avoid it!
● Special Needs
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. To determine if you qualify, please contact the Dean of Students at 471-6259; 471-4641
TTY. If they certify your needs, we will work with you to make appropriate arrangements.
● Religious or Holy Day Observance
"A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a
religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements
can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.”
(http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi04-05/ch4/ch4g.html)
● Email
“Electronic mail (e-mail), like postal mail, is a mechanism for official University communication to students. The
University will exercise the right to send e-mail communications to all students, and the University will expect that
e-mail communications will be received and read in a timely manner.”
(http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi04-05/app/appn.html). Both the instructor and the TA will
reply to student emails within 24 hours on weekdays and 48 hours on weekends barring a rare and extenuating
circumstances.
I look forward to working with you all this semester. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, do not
hesitate to email the Instructor or TA pool!
                                                                                                                     5
