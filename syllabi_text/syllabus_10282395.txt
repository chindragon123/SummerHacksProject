Course Description
The purpose of this course is for students to become familiar with core advertising research
methods. We will explore both traditional and contemporary research methods. Key methods
include qualitative, quantitative and digital. An emphasis will be placed on quantitative research
and will cover topics such as sampling, measurement, descriptive and inferential statistics. Given
that this course carries the quantitative reasoning flag, quantitative skills such as analyzing data
and basic calculation will be expected to succeed in this class. To substantiate students’
understanding of how each method is put into use, students will be exposed to empirical research
findings relevant to the field of advertising and consumer psychology. In addition, students will not


only learn about research methods but also be practicing research firsthand through class
assignments – including conducting interviews, designing survey questionnaires, and
analyzing/interpreting/reporting data through SPSS software.
Major Course Assignments
Assignments. There will be four assignments. All four assignments must be done individually,
meaning you may not discuss or work collaboratively with others. For the last assignment
(assignment 4), you will analyze data through SPSS software which you will be responsible to have
access to (see “technological requirements” section). Each assignment will be posted to Canvas and
will be due approximately one or two weeks later depending on the scope of the assignment. You
will submit your completed assignments to Canvas.
    Policy 1. Late work will NOT be accepted, meaning if you submit your assignment 1 minute after
    the deadline - it is considered late and you will receive a zero.
    Policy 2. The instructor or the TA will not proofread assignments. However, you will have sufficient
    opportunity to ask questions and work closely with us face-to-face during office hours.
    Policy 3. Grades for assignments will be reviewed and discussed only during the week immediately
    following when the grades are posted to Canvas.
Exams. There will be three exams. Exams reflect material covered in lectures and readings. Exams
are 50 multiple choice questions. The third exam will be your final exam and cumulative, covering
all topics covered from day 1 to the last day of class.
    Policy 1. Make-up exams are only given in the case of documented emergencies.
    Policy 2. You may bring calculators for the exams, but not phone calculators.
    Policy 3. Grades for exams will be discussed only during the week immediately following when the
    grades are posted to Canvas.
Attendance. I will administer 6 attendance check-ins this semester on random class meetings. Only
5 will count toward you grade. This means that you can miss 1 without penalty.
