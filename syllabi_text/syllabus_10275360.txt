                                       Course Description
Understanding human behavior is immensely challenging. Fortunately, there are tools
to help us make sense of social, cultural and political complexity. This course offers an
introduction to the various methods and techniques used in conducting ethnographic
research such as participant observation, interviewing, collecting life histories and
genealogies, archival research, working with material culture, social media-based
research, and visual ethnography. Our primary objectives will be to explore research
design, what constitutes evidence, how to analyze data, and strategies for writing up
and presenting results. We will pay particular attention to the ethical considerations
entailed in anthropological research, including questions of knowledge production,
power, location, experience, translation and representation. The course is run largely as
a “hands–on” workshop, in which students practice a variety of ethnographic methods
(both inside and outside of class), engage in ethnographic writing exercises, and actively
guide one another’s work. Students will apply what they learn during the course to
designing their own ethnographic research project, conducting independent field
research, and presenting their findings to the class. By the end of the semester, they will
have a firm grounding in ethnographic research methods and be better prepared for
more advanced work.
                                          Requirements
***Attendance and Participation (15%): Because this class meets once a week and
follows a workshop format, energetic, thoughtful and consistent participation is
mandatory. Students will be expected to attend all class meetings (attendance will be
taken). Each absence, beyond one, that is not explained by a doctor’s note or a university
administrator will result in a 3-point deduction of your final grade. Students are expected to
complete the readings as scheduled on the syllabus and to come to class fully prepared
to discuss them, with questions and ideas in mind. Students are also required to
complete all writing exercises as scheduled on the syllabus. If you miss any exercise,
without a formal written excuse, there will be NO make-up opportunity. If you are
having difficulty with any of the ideas presented in class, then it is your responsibility to
meet with other students or attend office hours to clarify course materials. Please use
these opportunities to your advantage.
Journals and Fieldnotes (10%): During the semester, you will keep a field journal in
which you will record your notes on observations and interviews, as well as your
                                                                                               1


responses to class readings, discussions, fieldtrips, and exercises. You may keep the
journal in any format this is convenient for you (i.e. old school spiral notebooks,
computer files, or iPad notes, for example). However, you will need to write them up in
clear and legible prose and hand them in on a regular basis throughout the semester.
Methods Exercises (25%): The ethnographic method exercises require you to conduct
various forms of ethnography on a weekly basis. Some exercises will take place in class.
Others will involve you having to go out into the world, well beyond the UT campus.
Nearly all the exercises involve writing to some extent. You will be expected take
detailed field notes and to provide brief written reports or essays about your
experiences. Detailed guidelines for all exercises will be given in class. Most exercises
will require a 2-3-page report, in addition to regular more informal fieldnotes.
Review of Ethnographic Monograph (10%): A four-page essay reviewing a monograph-
length ethnography of your choice. A brief proposal specifying which ethnography you
have chosen and why will be due in class on Feb 4 .   th
Research Project (20%): Students will be required to submit a 7-10 page research project.
Project guidelines will be given in class, early in the semester, and the final project will
be due on the last Friday of the semester. A brief abstract of the research proposal topic
will be due in class on Feb. 11 .
                                th
Oral Presentation of Research Findings (20%): All students will be required to give a 15
minute oral presentation on their research findings in class. The presentation will consist
of a brief description of your project and your preliminary findings, as well as a question
and answer session with your classmates. Presentations will occur in class on April 28     th
and May 5 . th
Your grade will be determined using your total point score. Note: there is no midterm or
final examination. You will be evaluated on the following basis:
        Attendance and Participation                            15 pts.
        Journal/Fieldnotes                                      10 pts.
        Methods Exercises                                       25 pts.
        Review of Ethnographic Monograph                        10 pts.
        Research Presentation                                   20 pts.
        Research Project                                        20 pts.
                                                         Total: 100 pts.
The scale for final grades is such that:
        94 to 100 pts. = A                         74 to 76 pts. = C
        90 to 93 pts. = A-                         70 to 73 pts. = C-
        87 to 89 pts. = B+                         67 to 69 pts. = D+
        84 to 86 pts. = B                          64 to 66 pts. = D
        80 to 83 pts. = B-                         60 to 63 pts. = D-
        77 to 79 pts. = C+                         59 pts. and fewer = F
                                                                                              2


Assignments will be due at the beginning of class and there will be no make-up exams,
incompletes, or time extensions, except in the case of emergencies. No extra credit
assignments are available.
Cheating will not be tolerated! Anyone caught cheating will be charged under the
academic misconduct code. Laptops, iPads/iPods, cell phones and other electronic
devices may not be used in class, unless a documented disability requires them. Please
be sure and turn all electronic devices off when you arrive (and not to simply silence
them).

This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are
designed to engage you in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester,
providing you with the opportunity for independent investigation of a question,
problem, or project related to your major. You should therefore expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from the independent investigation and presentation of
your own work.
This course also carries the Ethics and Leadership flag. Ethics and Leadership courses
are designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for making ethical decisions in
your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of
your grade to come from assignments involving ethical issues and the process of
applying ethical reasoning to real-life situations.
This class is challenging in that it requires active participation on a weekly basis and that
you stay organized and conscientious about assignments. However, it also provides a
unique hands-on learning environment that is a lot of fun. Let’s have a great semester!
