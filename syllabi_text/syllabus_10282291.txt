Required Readings
        You will be expected to read parts of the following books: Diaz, The Conquest of
New Spain, Menchaca, Recovering History, Constructing Race, and Deeds, Meyer, and
Sherman, The Course of Mexican History (older editions may be purchased). These
books are available at the University Co-op (2246 Guadalupe St.) and the reader may
be purchased at Jenn’s Copy & Binding, (2518 Guadalupe Street by Dean Keeton and
Guadalupe, 512-482-0779). Books are also on reserve at PCL.
Cultural Diversity Flag
This course fulfills a cultural diversity flag. The Cultural Diversity requirement is intended
to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural
experience. Courses carrying this flag ask you to explore the beliefs, practices, and
histories of at least one cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalization.
Many of these courses also encourage you to reflect on your own cultural experiences.
Exams and Assignment
        Students are required to take a quiz, midterm, and final examination. A three-
page paper review of two of the films viewed in class is also required. Your analysis of
the films can be written in one essay, or your paper can be based on two separate
reviews of the films. Readings from assigned articles or books can be included in your
analysis (e.g., the films offer an alternate analysis to the readings, the films provide
supplementary information to the readings on Mesoamerica).
Grading
        Attendance is required and excessive absences will affect your grade. Students
who have a perfect attendance record will receive a 3 point credit. Students with 1
absence will receive a 2 point credit, 2 absences 1 point credit, and 3 absences .5 point
credit. The points are added at the end of the semester to your accumulated test score
points.
        Only a doctor’s letter or a death in your family will be acceptable excuses for a
make-up exam. Professor Menchaca must approve the make-up exam ahead of time.
Students who have not attended class are not eligible for a make-up exam.
