This course carries the Cultural Diversity flag. The Cultural Diversity requirement
increases your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural
experience. Courses carrying this flag ask you to explore the beliefs, practices, and
histories of at least one cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalization.
Many of these courses also encourage you to reflect on your own cultural experiences.
See https://www.utexas.edu/ugs/flags/students/about/cultural-diversity
The class will focus on the fascinating work of African-American artists during a century
that in its second decade witnessed the ‘Harlem Renaissance’ of the 1920s and several
decades later gave rise to the ‘Black Arts Movement’ of the mid – late 1960s to early to
mid 1970s. The Harlem Renaissance stands as a towering moment of American creativity
and will figure prominently in our class syllabus. Our class, African-American Artists of
the 20th Century will present and discuss work that is as varied as the practitioners
responsible for it. Sculpture, printmaking, painting, figurative, non-figurative, trained,
untrained; the variations are almost endless. The period of time under discussion
witnessed hugely important developments of African American history. The ‘Great
Migration of people from the south to the northern industrial centers, World War II, the
Civil Rights Movement, all these factors and many more have their part to play in the
absorbing history of African American artists of the 20th century. The work of a number
of highly accomplished artists will be considered, from Aaron Douglas and William H.
Johnson to Dana Chandler, Elizabeth Catlett, and Faith Ringgold. The class will also seek
to put the work of these artists into a variety of the wider political, social and cultural
contexts that made the 20th century such an important period for African-American
people and also for America itself.
Learning Goals
By the end of this course you will be ready to:
• Pose critical questions of the ways in which African American artists have created
stories about the experiences of African Americans, as well as reflecting developments in
modern and contemporary art practices throughout the 20th century
• Develop close reading and visual literacy skills in order to experiment with different
methods of investigation and synthesize those findings into coherent verbal and written
arguments
• Thoughtfully and respectfully critique the intellectual work of others, and evaluate its
usefulness in relationship to your own inquiry and academic interests
• Have a greater understanding of the meaning and manifestations of African American


contributions to wider American culture
• Articulate your own opinions, arguments and understandings of African American art
