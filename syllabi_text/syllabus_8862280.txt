Fall Semester, 2018
Instructor: Toni Falbo, Professor of Educational Psychology. The most reliable way of
contacting Falbo is email: toni@prc.utexas.edu. She has a phone in her office: (512) 471.0603.
Falbo will be in her office (SZB 504B) after class. Students can also request appointments at
other times, as needed.
Objective: To explore the intersection of families and education by comparing the cultural
beliefs of families and the culture of schools within nations and across three dominant nations:
China, Japan, and the U.S.
Readings: There are two, required books:
        Chu, L. (2017). Little soldiers: An American Boy, a Chinese school, and the global race
to achieve. New York: Harper.
        Tobin, J. et al. (2009). Preschool in three cultures Revisited. Chicago: University of
Chicago Press.
In addition, we will be reading chapters from other books and scholarly articles about secondary
and post-secondary education in China, Japan, and the U.S.
Weekly Assignments: We will be reading chapters from the Chu and Tobin books and from
additional sources. Readings from other sources will be posted as files on our canvas site. Every
week, students are expected to write answers to questions posted on canvas by noon on the day
we are discussing that topic in class (in other words, before class). Each week students earn 5
points when they answer the questions and upload the answers onto canvas ON TIME. There are
12 readings, worth 5 points each, and so this accounts for 60% of each student’s grade.
Video Viewing: We have gained access to the videos produced by Tobin from his first and more
recent books (revisited). We will watch these in class, but students may well want to view them
outside of class, as well. They become available on Sept 1.

Paper: Students will write a 15-page paper about the intersection between families and
education, considering any level of education and any cultural or national group. The paper can
focus on a single culture, or subculture, or take a comparative approach. The paper will be due at
the end of the semester and will account for 20% of the course grade.
Student Presentation: Students will select a reading and present its contents to the class. Each
student will identify his or her own reading or ask Dr. Falbo for suggestions. During
presentations, students should explain why the content is important (which involves explaining
the information contained in the literature reviewed), the hypotheses (if any), how the “data”
were collected (including a description of participants and methods), and the conclusions. The
presentation should take about 20 minutes. This presentation counts 20% of final grade. If the
student chooses to make slides as part of the presentation (note that PPTs are not required), the
students should not read out loud from the slides. The students need to talk to classmates as
though trying to explain the content of the reading in conversational language.

Policy on Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University,
policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, please visit the
Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website
at: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct.
Religious Holy Days
Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. Sections 51.911
and 51.925 of the Texas Education Code address absences by students and instructors for
religious holy days.
Section 51.911 states that a student shall be excused from attending classes or other required
activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including travel for
that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized for


that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which
the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy required
students to notify each of their instructors as far in advance of the absence as possible so that
arrangements can be made.
EVACUATIONS: Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are
required to evacuate buildings when an alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
requires exiting the building and assembling outside. Students should familiarize themselves
with all exit doors of each classroom and building. Remember that the nearest exit door may not
be the one you used when entering the building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall
inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation,
follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given
instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police
Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
Carrying of Handguns
Individuals who hold a license to carry are eligible to carry a concealed handgun on campus,
including in most outdoor areas, buildings and spaces that are accessible to the public, and in
classrooms.
It is the responsibility of concealed-carry license holders to carry their handguns on or about
their person at all times while on campus. Open carry is NOT permitted, meaning that a license
holder may not carry a partially or wholly visible handgun on campus premises or on any
university driveway, street, sidewalk or walkway, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking
area.
