                                     will be determined from the following allocation:
                                     First exam (18%)

                                               however, due to the integrated nature of the material,
                                               there may be a comprehensive element to each exam.

                                     such that the total contribution to the course grade of all
                                     assignments is 36%.


                                In calculating your final grade, 10% will come from your display of

                                The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of
                                scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both students and
                                faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail
                                in the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at
                                http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics.aspx. By
                                teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all faculty
                                responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this
                                class, you have agreed to observe all student responsibilities
                                described in that document. If the application of the Statement on
                                Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear
                                in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
                                Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are

                                subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure
                                in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since
                                dishonesty harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the
                                University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on
                                scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to
                                the Student Judicial Services website at
                                http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ to access the official
                                University policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as
                                well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic
                                dishonesty.
