Course Summary
This course is an introduction to analyzing the behavior of basic structures through quantitative methods of
conventional structural analysis and design. It functions as an applied statics course and emphasizes schematic
calculations for the design of components and connections of various structural systems. In addition, rules of
thumb for the preliminary sizing of structural members will be introduced. The analysis aspects of this course
will examine the structural behavior and application of beams and columns in timber, steel, and reinforced
concrete. Throughout the course, the student will be required to make assessments in the areas of material,
form, and fabrication.
The primary objective of the course is to provide the student with the ability to use methods and analyses, along
with rules of thumb and present-day conventions, to determine the preliminary sizing and evaluation of a total
structural system. Consequently, the student will learn to make a judgment on which structural systems are
appropriate and applicable to a specific design solution.

Grading
Final grades are derived from homework and quizzes, three semester exams, and the semester projects.
Grading is based on a 100-point scale as follows:
A         93 - 100
A-        90 - 92
B+        87 - 89
B         83 - 86
B-        80 - 82
C+        77 - 79
C         73 - 76
C-        70 - 72
D+        67 - 69
D         63 - 66
D-        60 - 62
F         59 and below
The individual grades accumulated over the semester are averaged towards the final grade as follows:
Homework                   10%
Exam 1                     20%
Exam 2                     20%
Exam 3                     20%
Projects                   30%
NO INCOMPLETES WILL BE ALLOWED.
Attendance Policy
Attendance is mandatory in all lectures and labs. Students can have three (3) unexcused absences – for any
reason – without penalty. Each additional absence, regardless of the reason, will lower the final course grade by
one full letter grade.
Religious Observances
A student shall be excused from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
observance of a religious holy day, including travel for the purpose. A student whose absence is excused under
this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete
an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy
requires students to notify each of their instructors as far in advance of the absence as possible so that
arrangements can be made.
By UT Austin policy, you must notify the instructor of the pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the
date of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, an assignment, or a project in order to


observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable
time after the absence.
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The
University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.”
Representing the work of others as your own, including plagiarism, is taken very seriously at UT. You must cite
your sources when you use the words or ideas of others; otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject
to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s
Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php.
Personal Pronouns
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with
differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class
rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless they have added a “preferred name”
with the Gender and Sexuality Center (http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-
resources/). The instructor will gladly honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what
appears on the official roster and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise the
instructor of any changes early in the semester so appropriate updates may be made to their records.

racing thoughts, feeling unmotivated, or anything else is getting in your way, there are options available for help:

Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. Instructors are
committed to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but this is possible only if you discuss
your needs early. Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should


contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 512-410-6644 (Video Phone) as soon as
possible to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations. For more information, visit

BEVOCAL
BeVocal is a university-wide initiative to promote the idea that individual Longhorns have the power to prevent
high-risk behavior and harm. At UT Austin all Longhorns have the power to intervene and reduce harm. To learn
more about BeVocal and how you can help to build a culture of care on campus, go to:
https://wellnessnetwork.utexas.edu/BeVocal/.
BCAL
Concerns regarding the safety or behavior of fellow students, Teaching Assistants (TA), or Professors can be
reported to the Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050. Calls can be made anonymously. If
something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.
Title IX Reporting:
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual
assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions.
UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms.
When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
           1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
           2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
               become involved in a Title IX investigation.
           3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies:
               https://titleix.utexas.edu/policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory
Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. Your
instructor is a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in
writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related
incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for
support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For
more information about reporting options and resources, visit https://titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX
Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
Emergency Evacuation
In the case of emergency evacuation:
     • Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
           when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling
           outside.
     • Students should familiarize themselves with all exit doors of each classroom and building they may
           occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one used when entering the building.
     • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week
           of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
     • Reentry into a building is prohibited unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department,
           The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services offices.
