Course Description:
When someone asks ‘where are you from’ the answer is sometimes simple. Often
however, you find yourself going through a long list of places you have lived and left,
people you have loved and lost. Using novels and performances of the African
diaspora, this class will follow protagonists as they attempt to answer this question.
We begin with African Americans ‘returning’ to the ‘motherland’ only to find the
slave hold. Simultaneously Zimbabweans, Nigerians and other Africans, using the
desperate logic of colonialism, seek better opportunities in the so-called first world,
only to confront their foreign-ness and blackness in new ways. A young girl missing
the taste of mangoes, a magistrate in Edinburgh whose Walkman is on a constant
loop playing music from ‘back home’ in Zimbabwe, a geeky overweight Dominican
who sees himself as an X-man—these stories etch out the fraught politics of
belonging in the African diaspora. These characters splinter under the weight of
multiple transnational displacements, removals and returns, showing the high cost
of change. Performances and films include Zola Maseko’s film The Life and Times of
Sara Baartman and Dirty Pretty Things directed by Stephen Frears,
