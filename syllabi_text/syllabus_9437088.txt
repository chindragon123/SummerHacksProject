Purpose of Course:
The class will cover various tax issues affecting mergers and acquisitions, including both tax-free
reorganizations and taxable acquisitions. I expect everyone, at the end of the course, to be able to perform at
the level of a professional with 5-6 years experience. This includes running the tax end of a deal, determining
whether it should be taxable or tax-free, analyzing the variables for your client and both identifying and
resolving the principal tax issues. This is one of the most challenging --- but also one of the most interesting ---
areas of tax practice. This course is difficult and demands a great deal of thought, but I believe that there can
be great benefits to your arsenal of skills as tax practitioners.
Class Schedule
Thursday, March 7, will be HAT DAY. Everyone must wear a hat to class.
Part of the class on Tuesday, February 12, will be devoted to a session on preparing the Practice
Memorandum assigned on Monday, February 11. This practice memo will be due on Thursday, February 14.
There will be no class on Thursday, January 31, 2019.
Course Materials
The course materials will consist of readings in Bittker & Eustice, Federal Taxation of Corporations and
Shareholders, which is available in RIA-Checkpoint. Go to Table of Contents, then Federal Library, then
Federal Editorial Materials, then WG&L Federal Treatises, then Corporate Taxation, then B&E. There will be
other materials, including cases, regulations and rulings, all available in the course packet available at the
McCombs COPY CENTER on the Third Floor in GSB. You should bring copies of the core code and
regulation sections with you to every class. There will be no outlines distributed. This means that you will
have to take notes by hand.
Classroom Deportment
Cell phones must be turned off while you are in class. You may NOT use laptops in class. Beverages are
OK, but no food in class.
Evaluation and Grades
I will determine your final grade on the basis of two factors: written assignments during the course (70%),and
your participation in our discussions during class (30%). There will be no exams.
Reading Assignments
The tax issues involved in mergers and acquisitions are difficult and complex, and even in a summary course
such as this one the reading assignments are both detailed and long. Moreover, the knowledge in classes 1, 2
and 3 will form the base for understanding the material in classes 4, 5, and 6, and so on. You cannot fall
behind in these assignments
                                                           1


Written Assignments
There will be three written assignments in the form which you, as professionals, would prepare for clients or
employers. These may take the form of memoranda or drafting of sections of acquisition agreements. The
memorandum assignments will be given to you on Monday, February 25, Monday, April 8, and Monday,
May 6, respectively, and you will have 3 days to turn them in.
Class Participation
Just as I expect you to be able to communicate your analysis and conclusions in writing (in the memoranda
discussed above), I also expect every student to participate regularly in our class discussion. There will be no
exceptions; you cannot succeed in this course unless you are prepared every day to recite in class. It
is far more important for each student to make efforts than to get the “right” answer. As professionals, all of the
knowledge in the world will accomplish nothing unless it is coupled with the ability to express it clearly and to
discuss it with your peers. I will grade each student each day on participation.
Missed Assignments and Attendance
You will be excused from turning in work timely if you are deceased or if you become a parent during the
semester. I am willing to entertain other excuses, but don’t get your hopes up. A similar policy applies to
taking an “incomplete” for the course.
Non-Tax Issues
In some instances, you will determine that the tax issues under discussion raise certain non-tax issues, such
as accounting treatment, securities regulation or simply sound business practice. You should feel free to add
these to our discussion in class or in your written work --- bonus points may be available for these.
Scholastic Dishonesty--Departmental Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty. The Department of Accounting
has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard
to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty.
By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all the faculty responsibilities described in that document. By
enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all the student responsibilities described in that document. If
the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your
responsibility to ask me for clarification.
Memoranda: Each student is expected to complete the memoranda independently during the designated
memorandum period. No student may refer to other students’ memorandum solutions or discuss the
memorandum with other students during the memorandum period.
Professional Conduct. The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs
community. The collective class reputation and the value of the University of Texas experience hinges on this.
Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, you may call the Office of the
Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
