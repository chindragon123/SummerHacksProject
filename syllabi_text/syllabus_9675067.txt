Religious holy days: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence
at least seven days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must
miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a
religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within
a reasonable time after the absence.
C ANVAS is your reference for all things BIO311D including the syllabus,
reading assignments, grades, schedules, announcements and lecture summaries that
can be printed and brought to class as note-taking guides.
DISCUSSION SECTION (100 pts or 25%), 3 TERM MULTIPLE CHOICE EXAM grades
(100 pts each for a total 300 pts for 75%) comprise the semester grade. The FINAL
EXAM is optional, includes all material covered in class, and will be used to replace the
lowest term exam grade. In the case of a missed exam for documented medical or
family (death in the family, hospitalization of a loved one, etc.) reasons, a written make-
up exam will be provided. Any disputes concerning grades and/or assignments should
be addressed within three days of assignment date. Homework assignments should be
turned in for grading to the TA during discussion sections. Unannounced lecture
quizzes count as extra credit. If you have questions about your specific grade(s)
during the semester contact your T.A.; at the end of the semester direct your
questions to Dr. Panero.
