     • Your active participation in class activities will greatly enhance your progress in Japanese.

        class.)
2) Homework (Graded)
     • You must do your homework on your own. Please read the UT’s policies on students’
       scholastic dishonesty.
     • You will be given written and/or on-line homework assignments almost every day. Do your
       homework promptly and carefully. Answer all the questions even though you are not sure of the
       correct answers--your teachers can help you with your mistakes but need to have something to
       give feedback to.
     • The following marks will be used to give feedback to your homework assignments:
            H: hiragana Kt: katakana              Kj: kanji           Sp: spelling    V: vocabulary
            P: particle      Gr: grammar          Fm: form            Tns: tense      ¶: new paragraph
            ?: unclear       >: insertion              : change to Ord: order            strike deletion
     • All homework is due at the beginning of the class. If you need to submit an assignment earlier
       than the scheduled date, you must attach a written note which explains which assignment of what
       date you are turning in earlier. Also, if you wish to get feedback to your late homework (half
       credit), please attach a written note (that explains which assignment of what date).
     • Only in RARE emergency cases (e.g., funerals with the announcement, car accidents with a
       written note from the police), students will be allowed to submit the homework assignments
       missed during their absences and receive full credit if they submit them on the first day of their


       return.
     • Read the handouts: “kanji list,” “kanji practice example,” and “kanji practice sheet.”
     • Printout “Kanji Sheet” and 「書く宿題」 to turn in as your HW.
     • Write neatly. Write your name, color and # on each homework sheet. If there are more than two
       pages, staple them on the upper left corner. Your instructor is not responsible for missing pages.

       accepted but will not be counted for credit.

XI. Emergency Communications
Emergencies may range from inclement weather, to building evacuations, to campus closures, and the
university has a variety of tools to communicate with the public in the event of these and other possible
emergencies. Depending on the type of emergency, we may use some or all of the following tools to
communicate with faculty, staff and students:
Siren System
This system is tested around noon on the first Wednesday of every month, and delivers a siren warning
and public address in the event of certain outdoor emergencies.
Emergency Web Site
You may want to bookmark the emergency Web site https://www.utexas.edu/emergency/
because it is updated with information during actual emergencies or campus closures.
Local Press and Social Media
University Communications staff send emergency information to the press and update social media with
public safety messages. Because of the transient nature of our population, the university depends a great
deal on the press and social media to keep students, faculty, and staff informed during campus
emergencies.
Pager System


Our campus first responders, resident advisors, and some building managers are part of the AWACS
paging system. The pagers send text messages about emergencies on campus and alert city responders
(APD, AFD, EMS, Office of Emergency Management, etc.) to campus crisis situations.
Fire Panel Systems
Residence halls are equipped with fire panel systems that have a public address capability. Resident
advisors are trained to use these systems in emergencies in order to make announcements to the entire
building regarding evacuation, shelter in place, etc.
Text Alerts
The university collects cell phone numbers from members of the campus community for emergency text
messages.
University Group E-mail
During emergencies, UT Safety Alert sends an “urgent” group e-mail to every student, faculty and staff
member. The e-mail directs individuals to the emergency Web site for additional information and
instruction.
Voicemail to Office Telephones
This tool leaves a voice message on every faculty and staff member’s office phone on campus.
Cable TV
Residence halls and several of our public gathering places have cable televisions where emergency
announcements get posted.
Public Safety Patrol Car Announcements
UTPD patrol cars are equipped with PA systems, which officers can use to provide instructions to
pedestrians during emergencies.
University Emergency Information Line — 512-232-9999
Students, faculty, and staff can call this main number for information about campus closures.

handguns while visiting.
• Intercollegiate athletics events.• Spaces where K-12 programming is held.• Businesses that derive
more than 51 percent of their sales from alcohol.• Offices: University employees who are solely
assigned to an office are permitted to prohibit the concealed carry
of a handgun in that office and are required to provide oral notice to all visitors that the concealed carry
of a handgun is prohibited in the office.
• Selected labs: Certain laboratories and animal-research facilities may prohibit the concealed carry of
handguns.• Patient care areas including those in which mental health services are provided.


The holster must completely cover the trigger area and have enough tension to keep the gun in place if
jostled. A license holder may not carry a partially or wholly visible handgun on campus premises or on
any university driveway, street, sidewalk or walkway, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking area.
The open carry of handguns is not permitted on campus. Anyone who sees an openly carried gun on
campus should immediately call 911.
