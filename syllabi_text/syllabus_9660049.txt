                                             worthy of consideration.

                                           Learning occurs best when participants are
                                           enjoying what they are doing. I love to teach this
                                           course and will have fun being the instructor for
                                           this course. I am hopeful that you will find the
                                           sessions to be informative and engaging.
                                               Each session will include a mixture of
                                               instructional techniques, including lecture,
                                           discussion, guest presenters, video & audio clips,
                                           and/or in-class activities. I believe that you will
                                           find that the time goes by relatively quickly.

assignment will be available that can be completed to gain points missed for class that day.
Please note, assignments will require at least 3 hours worth of work. Due date will be
determined with students and instructor when absent is indicated.

                                        Academic honesty. I expect that all activities

                                        Office of the Dean of Students.
Course-Related Accommodations. I have tried to design this class using the principle of
universal design whereby most elements of the course are designed to accommodate a
wide range of student needs. However, I am prepared and quite willing to accommodate
any special needs that a student might have and for which I have not taken into
consideration in the design of the course. I will comply completely and without
reservation to any official directives provided by the Services for Students with Disabilities
Office (www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd). I also encourage you to meet with me if you
have any learning-related needs about which I should be aware.
Religious Considerations: Policy for absences due to religious holy days is set in the
Texas Education Code. The code states that a student who misses an examination, work
assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day must be given
an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence,
provided he or she has properly notified each instructor. It is the policy of The University
of Texas at Austin that the student must notify each instructor at least 14 days prior to the
classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent. For religious holidays that fall within
the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given on the first day of the
semester. The student may not be penalized for these absences, but the instructor may
appropriately respond if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed assignment
or examination within a reasonable time after the excused absence.

Grade of incomplete. The grade of "Incomplete" will be granted only if a student has
completed 75% of the course. This grade designation will result from a request from a
student based on extraordinary personal or academic reasons, or by me, when deemed
necessary. A due date for completing the course will be negotiated by the student and the
instructor. If the course is not completed by the agreed upon due date, the grade
corresponding to the number of points already earned will be submitted or will
automatically convert to a grade of “F” by the university system.

Class Particiapation        Come to class ready to have fun and learn. I want this
                            course to be meaningful and enjoyable. I want
                            students to feel comfortable sharing thoughts and
                            comments and being open about perceptions and
                            misconceptions they hold towards individuals with
                            differences.

Class Session Activities    lecture, discussion, activities, media, guest speakers
Course Protocol/ Guidelines I am asking you to honor the following requests:
                                *respect other class members & my guests
                                *ask questions during class
                                *let me know if there are environmental needs/problems
                                *let me know in advance -- if you are going to miss class
                                    or have to leave class early
Phone use in class          In all likelihood, there will NEVER be a need to use your
                            smartphone in class. As a result, please place your iPhones,
                            Androids, or other devices in the “silent” mode.
Computer use in class       You will NEED to bring your laptop or tablet to class.
                            However, I would ask that you NOT use your computer for
                            non-class-related purposes.
                            NB: I may designate “digital-free times” when EVERYONE
                            must close his/her computer, etc.


In Class Behavior      I will KNOW who you are and will be cognizant of your in-class
                       behavior – so, if I feel that there is a problem with in-class behavior
                       (e.g., behavior that interferes with the learning of others and actually
                       your own (e.g., excessive chatting; excessive non-class-related digital use
                       -- constantly looking at your computer but no notetaking), you are
                       likely to HEAR from me privately. However, I encourage students to
                       speak directly to one another about any problem that arise.
Emergency Evacuations  In light of an emergency, please familiarize yourself with all exit doors
                       of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the
                       nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
                       building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform Katie
                       in writing during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation,
                       follow my instruction. Do not re-enter a building unless given
                       instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University
                       of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
Plagiarism             UT Senate: “if you use words or ideas that are not your own you must
                       cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism.”
                       I am becoming increasing aware of this problem ... so, I strongly
                       recommend that you comply with issue of scholarly integrity.
Syllabus               A syllabus establishes a “working relationship” between the student and
                       the course instructor. Participation in this course indicates your
                       acceptance of its content, requirements, and policies. Please review this
                       syllabus in detail as soon as possible (and click the “Accept” button!).
Supports for students  UT provides a number of support services for students. An initial
                       overview of services can be found at the Dean of Students website
                       (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu). Please see me if you have any
                       questions or concerns.
Withdrawal from course If you believe that the purpose, goals, policies, requirements, or some
                       other aspect of this course does not meet your interests, needs, or
                       expectations, you should drop the class by the drop/add deadline. Note
                       that other sections (and instructors) of ALD 322 are available this term
                       at UT, and, given that variations in policies and requirements do exist
                       across sections, you may want to explore these other options.
                       If you do decide to drop ALD 322, I wish you the best.
