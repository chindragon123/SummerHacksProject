                                                   Teaching Philosophy
                                                     Learning occurs best when participants are
                                                     enjoying what they are doing. I love to teach this
                                                     course and will have fun being the instructor for
                                                     this course. I am hopeful that you will find the
                                                     modules to be informative and engaging.
                                                          Each session will include a mixture of

       A. Administrative Policies
Academic Honesty. I expect that all activities
performed in this class conform to a standard of
personal integrity and honesty. I will ask each student:                          Assignments. All assignments are to be

Office of the Dean of Students.                                                   not be accepted.
Course-Related Accommodations. I have tried to design this class using the principle of universal design whereby most
elements of the course are designed to accommodate a wide range of student needs. However, I am prepared and quite
willing to accommodate any special needs that a student might have and for which I have not taken into consideration
in the design of the course. I will comply completely and without reservation to any official directives provided by the
Services for Students with Disabilities Office (www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd). I also encourage you to meet with
me if you have any learning-related needs about which I should be aware.
Religious Considerations. Policy for absences due to religious holy days is set in the Texas Education Code. The code
states that a student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious
holy day must be given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence,
provided he or she has properly notified each instructor. It is the policy of The University of Texas at Austin that the
student must notify each instructor at least 14 days prior to the classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent. For
religious holidays that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given on the first day of the
semester. The student may not be penalized for these absences, but the instructor may appropriately respond if the
student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed assignment or examination within a reasonable time after the excused
absence.                                          -Class is online but please let me know if you have a religious conflict!
CARE Counseling. CARE is a program through the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center. It is common to need
support when dealing with feelings and problems that seem beyond your control. CARE Counselors are available to
help with a variety of issues that may serve as a barrier to your academic success.
Your CARE Counselor in the College of Education is Danie White, LPC, LMFT. Her office is in the George I.
Sanchez Building, SZB 212E. To schedule an appointment, call 512-232-6862 and ask to schedule a CARE
appointment. If you leave a voice mail, please include your name, EID, and contact number. Walk-in hours are also
available on Tuesdays and Fridays from 1 – 2 PM. You will check-in at the College of Education’s Student Division in
SZB 216, and they will let Danie know you’re waiting. (Via Zoom now)


                          B. Course structure
Online Module Based Instruction. This course
will be taught online using daily modules per

Zoom meetings (with time options) but most

Grade of incomplete. The grade of "Incomplete" will be granted only if a student has
completed 75% of the course. This grade designation will result from a request from a
student based on extraordinary personal or academic reasons, or by me, when deemed
necessary. A due date for completing the course will be negotiated by the student and the
instructor. If the course is not completed by the agreed upon due date, the grade
corresponding to the number of points already earned will be submitted or will
automatically convert to a grade of “F” by the university system.

                                 overview of services can be found at the Dean of Students website

Withdrawal from course If you believe that the purpose, goals, policies, requirements, or some
                                other aspect of this course does not meet your interests, needs, or
                                expectations, you should drop the class by the drop/add deadline. Note
                                that there are no other sections of ALD 322 available this term at UT
