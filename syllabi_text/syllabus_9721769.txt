This course introduces literary, religious, and courtly cultures of early modern India (1500-
1800). We will read scholarly writings to get a historical and theoretical background of this
period. In addition to this scholarship, we will read primary sources in translation: including
memoirs of emperors, Sufi romances, devotional and courtly poetry, merchants accounts, and the
nationalist construction of an Indian past. The goal of this course is to engage students with a
broad range of texts to inform them of the traditions on their own terms while linking the
discussion to current scholarship on the subject matter.
Goals:
    •   To get acquainted with major literary and religious traditions as well as the history of
        early-modern India.
    •   To discuss the historical, religious, mythological, and cultural aspects of literary works.
    •   To improve critical thinking and academic writing skills by reading, discussing, and
        writing about multidisciplinary secondary sources.
