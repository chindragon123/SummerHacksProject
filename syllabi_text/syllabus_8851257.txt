COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course explores business processes and internal controls for accounting information systems (AIS).
Students will learn fundamentals related to conceptual and computerized accounting systems, as well as
general and application controls related to those systems.
At the end of the course, students will be able to:
      Identify the events involved in an organization’s business processes and understand how these
        processes interact with an organization’s accounting system;
      Identify risks present in a business process and recommend internal controls to ensure that transactions
        are executed as expected and that the accounting records are reliable.
      Analyze business transactions and develop appropriate business processes and accounting records to
        support the transaction;
      Identify and implement technologies used to process transactions; ensure that IT general and
        application controls are in place and operating effectively.
The course objectives are focused on 1) specific skills and concepts that are required to be successful in the
business world and 2) topics included on the CPA exam. Please read below what your peers are saying about
ITAC:
“Having taken and passed the Auditing section of the CPA exam, I can't even begin to tell you
 how much your ITAC class helped in my preparation for the exam. Everything from transaction
 processes to computerized auditing tools showed up in my review book, and I was one step
 ahead having taken your ITAC class.”
“One way your ITAC class helped during my internship was by giving me a strong knowledge
 about a firm's revenue and expenditure processes. This allowed me to have a greater
 understanding of my client’s business, and I was able to complete my work more efficiently as a
 result.”
"ITAC is undoubtedly one of the most valuable courses I took in the MPA Program. While
 interviewing for full-time employment, it impressed companies that I was technologically
 competent with software products such as Excel, Access, and SAP, and that I could streamline
 processes through the use of flowcharting. I would recommend this course to every student in
 the program because it gives you a competitive edge that is constantly demanded in the
 workplace."

                                                 Fall 2018 Syllabus
        Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
         buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
         assembling outside.
        Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember
         that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
        Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform the instructor in writing during the first week
         of class.
        In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
        Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The
         University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
        Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050 or

McCombs Classroom Professionalism Policy: The highest professional standards are expected of all
members of the McCombs community. The collective class reputation and the value of the Texas MPA
experience are built on these high standards. Students are expected to be professional in all respects.
You should treat the Texas MPA classroom as you would a corporate business meeting. The Texas MPA
classroom experience is enhanced when:
    Students arrive on time.
    Students display their name cards.
    Students do not use the classroom as a cafeteria.
    Students are fully prepared for each class. Bring your class notes for the class topic and be ready to
     discuss and work the class exercises. Much of the learning takes place in the classroom and up to 80
     points (15% of your grade) can be earned during the time spent in the classroom. When you are not
     prepared, you cannot contribute to the overall learning process. This affects not only you, but your peers who
     count on you as well.
    Students attend the class section to which they are registered. Important: TopHat points are earned for the
     section that you are registered.
    Students respect the views and opinions of their colleagues. Pay attention, listen respectfully and look
     for opportunities to build on points made in the lecture or by a classmate. Please ask questions when
     something is unclear and chime in when you think you can help or offer your own personal experience.
     Collaboration and debate in class and online in the discussion boards are encouraged. Intolerance for the
     views of others is unacceptable.
    Laptops/tablets are allowed for note-taking, answering TopHat questions, and viewing course materials
     ONLY with penalties assessed if there is abuse of this privilege – see below.
    Use of phones for personal texts, tweets, games and Facebook are NOT allowed during class. This
     behavior is unprofessional and never allowed in a corporate meeting. When a need to communicate with
     someone outside of class exists (e.g., a medical or family need), please inform me prior to class.
    Penalties for online activity other than TopHat: First offence is a 20 point deduction on your next exam
     score AND your TopHat points will NOT be earned for that class. Subsequent offences will entail a letter
     grade deduction for each offense and your TopHat points will revert to zero for the course. (Note: penalty
     is double if offense is during a guest speaker or student presentation).
