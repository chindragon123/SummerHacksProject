Infrastructure enables movement, whether of water or people; it distributes electricity and goods;
and it affords connectivity between people over time and space. As such, infrastructure creates
relationships between resources, energy, built form, information, and people. Often unnoticed until
it breaks down, infrastructure provides the underpinning for much of life as we know it. This course
explores what infrastructure is and what it does. Topics include: everyday engagement and use; what
happens when infrastructure fails; how infrastructure supports or challenges social inequalities; the
work required for the creation and maintenance of infrastructure; ecological, legal, and political
dimensions of infrastructure; and the relationship between senses, emotion, and materiality. Finally,
it asks: what is the promise of infrastructure, and can new forms of infrastructure can be imagined?
The class is organized around 3 infrastructural forms – energy, water, and transportation – drawing
on texts that introduce key conceptual concerns in the anthropology of infrastructure. Using Austin
as a site for the ethnographic investigation of infrastructure, we will take field trips to 3 sites as a
class. These will serve as the cases for group ethnographic research projects that will conducted
throughout the semester.
Course objectives
Through this course students will learn:
     • What infrastructure is and its significance for social life
     • What it means to approach infrastructure from an anthropological perspective
     • Ethnographic research design
     • Ethnographic methods, including participant-observation, interviewing, and media
         documentation
     • Theoretical, methodological, and ethical dimensions of ethnography
Independent Inquiry
This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are designed to
engage you in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing you with the
opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related to your major.
You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from the independent
investigation and presentation of your own work.
University Writing Center
I strongly encourage you to use the services offered by the University Writing Center. The UWC
offers 45-minute, one-on-one consultations with UT students on any piece of writing. You may visit
up to three times per assignment. The consultants are well trained, and the cost of the service is
covered in your tuition. If you wish to make an appointment, you may do so through the UWC
website: uwc.utexas.edu.


Course requirements
Participation and attendance [10%]
This course will be run in a seminar format, with class sessions consisting of discussion of readings,
fieldtrips, and your ethnographic research. If you must miss class please let me know in advance, or
as soon as possible. It is especially important that you attend all fieldtrips. Absences will be
considered excused for religious holidays, illness, or extenuating circumstances due to an emergency.
More than 1 unexcused absence will affect your grade.
Reading responses and discussion [5%]
You are responsible for reading responses for the infrastructural area of your group. These should
be posted to Canvas by Wednesday at noon, two days before our fieldtrip. All students not writing
reading responses should respond to one post by 8 a.m. on Friday. The response should be
substantive, pointing out strengths as well as adding additional insights or questions. As we will not
have much time to discuss the readings in class, Canvas discussion is crucial.
Your reading response (250 words) should address at least 2 of the following:
     • Main point/s of the reading with a quote from the text that best captures this
     • Key concept/s or terms used and their meaning, as you understand it
     • Ethnographic material drawn on by the author, and the specific methodologies used
     • Something that was particularly interesting, curious, or confusing to you
When there are multiple readings, aim to read across them, drawing out a shared theme and
addressing commonalities and differences between the texts.
Fieldtrip reports [15%]
The class fieldtrips are an opportunity to experience ethnographic research with a group. Take
detailed fieldnotes and ask questions! Write a summary of your fieldnotes and post to Canvas by
Monday at 5 p.m., following the fieldtrip.
Group projects and ethnographies [70%]
As a group, students will 1. Identify the topic and “field” for the group and each member, 2.
develop a research topic, focusing on what it means to ask an anthropological question about
infrastructure and 3. complete a literature review with annotated bibliography.
Individually (or in pairs), students will 4. conduct independent ethnographic research on an aspect
of their group’s infrastructural form that includes participant-observation, interviews, and media. 5.
analyze ethnographic material and 6. write up an ethnography of findings to be compiled, with 7.
introduction and conclusion written by the group and 8. a media presentation to be 9. presented
verbally, followed by 10. Peer feedback and reflection.
                                                                                                       2

Important Safety Information
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety
and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
    • Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
        evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires
        exiting and assembling outside.
    • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
        Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
        building.
    • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the
        first week of class.
    • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not
        re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The
        University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
    • Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can
