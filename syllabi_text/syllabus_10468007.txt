Description:
In this beginning fiction workshop, we will use three basic steps to develop your
creative writing abilities. The first step is for you to learn how to read like a writer, being
aware not only of the content, but also the mechanics behind a story—character
development, narrative structure, point of view, plot, etc. Learning to identify these
elements will help you understand how to make use of them in your own work. You will
read at least one assigned story (either from the textbook or those posted on Canvas)
for many of our class meetings. For the early part of the course, you will also read
various sections of the Burroway textbook dealing with the craft of fiction.
The second step is for you to learn how to critique stories within a workshop setting.
By critically examining someone else’s writing you will discover the strengths and
weaknesses in your own stories. The idea is to develop your editing skills so that you
can then further develop your own writing, in and out of this class.
The final step is for you to actually write stories that apply the skills we have discussed.
After receiving feedback on your work, you should have an idea on how to improve the
original draft.
Since this is a workshop, your participation in the class discussion is critical to your
final grade.
Note: This writing course focuses on literary fiction, not genre fiction—including sci-fi,
horror, romance, mystery, etc.
Required Texts: Writing Fiction: A Guide to Narrative Craft (9th Edition), by Janet
Burroway and Elizabeth Stuckey-French, Pearson/Longman


Optional (but strongly encouraged): How Not to Write Bad: The Most Common
Writing Problems and the Best Ways to Avoid Them, by Abe Yagoda, Riverhead Books
Various Handouts on Canvas
WRITING ASSIGNMENTS
Daily exercises: Most of our classes during the early part of the course will begin with a
short writing prompt, which will help you start writing and, ideally, identify something
you may want to develop into a sketch or your short story. Please have paper and
something to write with for these early classes of the semester. These exercises are for
you to hold on to and will not be graded.
2 Sketches: In order to develop your ideas into longer narratives and potential stories,
you will begin by writing two different sketches or scenes. Though each sketch will be
only 2-3 pages in length, these exercises are designed to help develop your storytelling
skills. You can find detailed instructions for both assignments on Canvas. Please email
me your sketches on the assigned date or earlier if you feel like you are satisfied with
what you have written. Your work needs to arrive on time to receive full credit.
1 Short Story Draft: Students will write one original and fully developed story, 6-10
pages in length. On the assigned date, listed below, you will email your draft (both in
Word.doc and PDF) to me. Please refer to the Guidelines section below for instructions
on formatting.
Individual Conference: I will meet with each of you individually over Zoom to discuss
your story and offer feedback. Your conference day and time will depend on which of
the four groups you are assigned to. Your revised story will be due back to me one
week after our meeting.
Revision: After receiving your revised story, I will post it on Canvas for the entire class
to read before your workshop. Again, please refer to the Guidelines section below for
instructions on formatting.
Critiques: Learning to read like a writer means learning to critique—both verbally and in
written form—like a writer. The ability to discern the effectiveness of different narratives
will help you to look more critically at your own work. For the stories we will discuss in
workshop, you will mark your (constructive) comments in the margins of each story and
then type a 1-page critique of the story for the writer. As part of your Class
Participation grade, you are required to write these comments on every student story.
Writing a full 1-page critique, will help you articulate your thoughts in the workshop.
Email your critique to me before class in order to get full credit for the assignment.
These critiques are due whether you’re able to attend class or not. Please let me know
if you have any questions.
                                              2


Assigned Discussions: The professor will divide the class into groups of 2-3 students
and each group will be responsible for leading a discussion on at least one assigned
story. This means your group should talk about the story amongst yourselves before
class, which will need to be done over email. The point is to figure out what area, or
areas, of the story you’d like to focus on and what role each person will have—and yes,
everyone in the group needs to present. Your group’s Assigned Discussion should last
about 10 minutes before the rest of the class joins in. You can discuss topics such as
plot, character development, narrative voice, setting, themes, metaphor, structure, or
any other element that struck you as interesting about the story. Try to stick to no more
than a couple of these topics just so your discussion is in-depth and covers more than
just the surface.
GUIDELINES
• All drafts and final stories must be typed and double-spaced, with a one-inch margin
       on all sides. Stick to a standard font: Times or Helvetica. Type your name and
       the course number (CRW F325F) in the upper right-hand corner of the first
       page—number your pages.
• Proofread all your work. A lack of attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, and
       clarity will affect your grade. (Proper grammar includes using the appropriate
       tense throughout your story.) If you’re not absolutely clear on the rules regarding
       basic punctuation or grammar—comma splice, run-on sentence, proper
       dialogue tags, consistently using either past or present tense—please look them
       up in the Yagoda book. Fully developed stories that otherwise may have
       received an “A” often end up with a “C,” or lower, because of these surface
       errors.
• Your story must arrive in my inbox by its due date. A story that arrives after the
       deadline will automatically receive a lower grade, e.g., a story that would have
       normally received a “B” will now receive a B-. A story that arrives the day after
       class will drop a full letter grade. So the “B” story is now a “C” story, and so on.
       Please alert me if you think you’re not going to make the deadline; it’s easier to
       negotiate an extension ahead of time than it is to explain why your story is late
       and won’t be arriving for at least another day.
• When commenting on a student’s story, type your critique on a word.doc. Be sure to
       email me a copy of your critique before our class discussion. This is a major part
       of your grade. You’re responsible for writing a critique on everyone else’s story
       discussed in a workshop, even on the day your own story is being discussed.
• Critiques may be written in the form of a letter or a memo with bullet points, but in
       either case each critique needs to be a minimum of 200 words.
• Critiques are due in my inbox before each story is discussed. If you need to miss
       class, make sure to email your critiques to me before the workshop. Critiques
       that arrive after the workshop will not receive full credit.
                                               3

Your final grade will be based on the quality of your work, the amount of effort you
demonstrate, and your progress during the course. Always show up to class prepared
to discuss the assigned text—this includes all workshop material.
Ground Rules for Zoom
•   Focus on the discussion. Which means, don't be walking your dog or doing your
    laundry or texting while we're in class. I understand that life and family obligations
    may occasionally interrupt how much you are able to concentrate. As I mentioned,
    some of these discussions won't last as long as a normal class, so please do what
    you can to be all in.
•   Although we are not physically in the same classroom, please dress as if we are.
    I'm expecting everyone to bring their best self to our discussion.
•   You should find a quiet and comfortable spot for our discussion, but you shouldn't
    be lying in bed. Please find a table to sit at or a couch to plop down on, but just be
    upright.
•   Zoom will obviously work on your phone, but if at all possible, try to connect to our
    meeting on a computer (laptop or desktop) or tablet. If you don't have this option,
    find a place where you can keep your phone steady during the call.
•   The sound on Zoom calls can be patchy at times, so using earbuds of some kind
    will be helpful.
