Description
Students enrolled this class will focus on learning the basic concepts behind digital audio and recording.
The course will cover foundational material for dealing with recording, editing, sequencing, and mixing
inside a Digital Audio Workstation. The primary objective of this course is to provide a functional
understanding of digital audio systems and recording techniques that can be utilized in various fields
including, but not limited to: audio production, film scoring, game music, and sound design.
By the end of this course, students will:
         •    Have an understanding of principles of sound (both acoustic and digital)
         •    Work with manipulation, entry and sequencing of MIDI data and instruments to create
              synthesized, and sampled sounds - This includes editing techniques and learning about
              various forms of processing such as reverberation, filtering, audio compression and other
              special effects.
         •    Gain experience editing, manipulating and processing audio recordings
         •    Create a stand-alone piece of music or sound design project demonstrating the knowledge
              gained throughout the semester
Class Format:
This course will be split between lectures and lab work. Some days will be dedicated to lecturing,
answering questions, and demonstrating concepts. As the semester continues the lectures will begin to
be split with hands-on lab work in the multimedia lab, using the tools demonstrated in class. Students will
also be expected to complete projects and assignments according to the topics discussed.

Classroom policies
Students are expected to attend class daily. Students will have 2 excused absences (without doctor’s
note/notification). Each absence beyond 2 (without a doctor’s note/notification) will result in a reduction of
5 points off the final (assignments) point total in the course.
All students are expected to participate in class discussion, and are expected to respect the opinions and
statements of their classmates during discussion and classroom activities.
Contacting Teacher or TA(s)
For basic questions concerning assignments or lectures, email the the TAs and CC me. In addition feel
free to stop by during my office hours.
Note about email: Most weekdays I typically check my email early morning and in the evening. Please
allow adequate time for responses.
Grading
Projects and homework will be submitted online via Canvas.
Make-up work will be accepted under special circumstances only. There will be no make-up exams,
except in emergency circumstances (please see me for additional details).
Assignments should be turned in on time. Late assignments will be accepted up to 1 week after the due
date, with a 5% deduction for each day late.
                   The final grade is calculated from:
                                                        !3


                45% – Assignments/quizzes/projects
                15% – Midterm
                35% – Final project
                5% – Attendance
Grading Policy
To ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage.
Thus a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999... The University does not
recognize the grade of A+. Thus, the conversion from percentage value to letter grade is as
follows:
                A = 94 – 100
                A- = 90 – 93.999…
                B+ = 87 – 89.999…
                B = 84 – 86.999…
                B- = 80 – 83.999…
                C+ = 77 – 79.999…
                C = 74 – 76.999…
                C- = 70 – 73.999…
                D+ = 67 – 69.999…
                D = 64 – 66.999…
                D- = 60 – 63.999…
                F = 0 – 59.999…

Personal Pronoun Preference
                                                  !4


    Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals
    and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation,
    gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with
    the student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate
    name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that
    I may make appropriate changes to my records.
University Policies
Academic Integrity
    Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor
    Code: “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core
    values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very
    seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that
    you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be
    guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of
    the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the
    University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address: http://
    deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
 Drop Policy
    If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before
    the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas
    law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas
    institution. For more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/
    adddrop/qdrop
 University Resources for Students
    Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because
    we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or
    exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to
    meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. There are also a range of
    resources on campus:
 Services for Students with Disabilities
    This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If
    there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you
    have medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific
    arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am
    committed to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do
    so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the
    confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact
    Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video
    phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
Counseling and Mental Health Center
    Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
    avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
    help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
                                                  !5


     All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
     helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is
     learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
     If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings
     like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. http://
     www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html

     The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of
     Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
     Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
     evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
     requires exiting and assembling outside.
 •   Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
     Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
     building.
 •   Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the
     first week of class.
 •   In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not
     re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The
     University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
