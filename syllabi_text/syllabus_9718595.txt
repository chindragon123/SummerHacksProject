This course focuses on essential developments in Greek history (social, cultural, and
political) during the Archaic and Classical Periods (ca. 750-338 BCE): from the rise of
the Greek city-states in the eighth century BCE to the subordination of Greece by Philip
II of Macedonia in 338 BCE. The course will devote roughly equal time to covering
major events and personalities, exploring key developments in culture and society,
examining the various types of evidence available for the era (both written and
archeological sources), and honing writing skills. We will begin (Weeks 1-3) with a brief
look at the geography and climate of Greece and its prehistory, including the Bronze and
Early Iron Ages (ca. 1600-750 BCE). Then we will consider (Weeks 4-5) some of the
significant developments of the Archaic Period (ca. 750-478 BCE), including the rise of
the city-state (or polis) and the first forms of (small “d”) democracy, the invention of the
Greek alphabet, the introduction of massed infantry (or hoplite) warfare, and the diaspora
of Greeks across the Mediterranean. Thereafter, we will focus (Weeks 6-10) on the two
most famous city-states of Greece, Athens and Sparta, and follow their trajectories from
their foundation in the Bronze Age, through the Persian War period (490-478 BCE). We
will conclude our survey (Weeks 11-16) with the Classical period, including the
Peloponnesian War (430-404 BCE) and the complex era of unstable hegemonies in the
first half of the fourth century BCE that culminated in 338 BCE when Philip II of
Macedonia established his control over Greece.

We will make extensive use of Canvas. In addition to the Syllabus, you will find the
following course materials there:
        •   “Assignment and Study Guide” for each lecture
        •   “Assignment and Study Guide” for the each week’s discussion section
        •   weekly quizzes
        •   supplementary readings
        •   power points
3. Lectures
There will be two weekly lectures (MW 12:00-1:00 in Parlin 201). These will combine
historical outline with exploration of historical themes and problems in the interpretation
of historical evidence. In order to get the most out of the lectures you will need to have
completed the reading assignment in advance of the lecture. Attendance is required and
will be checked regularly.
The Syllabus provides a road map for the course. You will find the assignments on
Canvas in Modules. The “Assignments and Study Guides” will list the readings for the
day, study questions to help guide you through the readings, and sometimes links to
websites, images, etc. You are not required to write out answers to the questions asked on
the Assignment and Study Guide for each lecture unless you are specifically asked to do
so. We will not take up all of the questions together in lecture, but you should be able to
respond to them all. If you can’t or have questions about the questions, bring them up in
class.
4. Discussion Sections

The weekly sections are required; informed participation in them will constitute a
significant portion of this component of your grade. The main purpose of the discussion
sections is to learn how to analyze ancient sources and discuss interpretations of them
both orally and in writing. You will find the assignments for the discussion sections,
study questions, and sometimes links to websites, images, etc. in Modules on Canvas.
You should come prepared to discuss the questions in the discussion sections. You will
need to bring the relevant materials (readings and images etc.) with you to section.
5. Weekly Canvas Quizzes

Beginning Friday September 13 and continuing every Friday thereafter we will post a
quiz on Canvas covering that week’s material (readings, lectures, discussion sections).
The quiz will be available from Friday to 5 PM the following Monday.
6. Writing Assignments
1. Writing Assignment One (Weeks 4-7). Analyzing Ancient Sources
We’ll begin this assignment on Monday 9/9 by discussing how to analyze ancient sources and by
each of you picking a topic for your paper. Over the course of the following four weeks you will:
    •   write a draft of your paper and post your draft to Canvas
    •   lead a discussion of your topic in section
    •   receive written feedback from your classmates and your instructor
    •   revise your drafts and submit your papers
Due dates for this writing project will depend on the topic you choose/are assigned. More on this
on Monday 9/9.
2. Writing Assignment Two (Weeks 7-10). Critiquing Modern Scholarship
At the start of Week 7 we will post to Canvas three or so scholarly articles/chapters that pertain
to the content of lectures and discussion sections of Weeks 8-10. On Monday 10/7 we will
discuss what a critical analysis of modern scholarship on ancient history entails. Over the course
of the following three weeks you will:
    •   choose one of the articles for your critique, due Monday 10/14
    •   write a draft of your paper, due Wednesday 10/23
    •   receive written feedback from your instructors on Monday 10/28
    •   revise your drafts and hand them in on Monday 11/4
3. Writing Assignment Three (Weeks 11-14). Analysis of ancient Greece vase in the Blanton
collection.
The third paper will analyze one of the Greek vases in the collection of the Blanton Museum.
This project will begin with a lecture Wednesday 10/30 on ancient Greek religion. We will
follow this up with a “fieldtrip” to the Blanton Museum for the discussion sections 10/31-11/1.
There are currently some dozen vases on display that may be analyzed in terms of their
contributions to our understanding of ancient Greek religion. Each of you will select one Greek
vase from the dozen or so available vases. You will research the history of the vase using the on-
line archives of the Blanton Museum collection and write a paper on the vase that includes:
    •   a description of how the vase entered the Blanton collection
    •   a description of the vase itself (shape, function, decoration)
                                              -3-

    •   an analysis of what the vase contributes to our understanding/knowledge of ancient Greek
        religion
Papers will be due Monday 11/24.
7. Grading
We will use the University’s system of equivalences between numeric scores and letter
grades:
A 93-100; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76; C- 70-72; D+ 67-
69; D 63-66; D- 60-62; F 59 and below.
There will be no curve. If 50% of you score over 93, 50% of you will get an A. If nobody
does, nobody will. Consistent improvement during the semester will improve your final
course grade.
15%     Discussion Section
10%     Canvas Quizzes
20%     Writing Assignment 1
20%     Writing Assignment 2
20%     Writing Assignment 3
15%     Final Exam
When merely quantitative methods cannot be applied, I will assign grades according to
the following qualitative standards: an A-range grade (A+, A, A-) indicates mastery of
the material and skills involved in the assignment; a B-range grade (B+, B, B-) indicates
advanced competency; a C-range grade (C+, C, C-) indicates basic competency; a D-
range grade (D+, D, D-) indicates effort but insufficient competency; an F means that
either you did not complete the assignment on time or something went drastically wrong
in your execution of the assignment.
8. Attendance
Attendance is required for both lectures and discussion sections. Each student is allowed
3 unexcused absences from lectures and 1 unexcused absence from discussion section
without penalty. Any other absence must be appropriately documented (e.g., with a
doctor’s note or a note from Student Emergency Services – Office of the Dean of
Students). Notify me or your TA of your situation as soon as possible and document it
immediately upon your return to class. Failure to comply with these rules will result in
the loss of 1% of your final grade for each unexcused absence.
9. Class Etiquette
Cell phones should be turned off or set to silent ring during class time. The use of laptops
and tablets is allowed only for taking notes and checking assigned readings.

Scholastic dishonesty on any graded assignment will result in zero credit on the
assignment. A second infraction will result in an F for the course. All cases of scholastic
dishonesty will be reported to the student’s college adviser.
Scholastic dishonesty includes any kind of cheating or collaboration on tests, or
submitting work that is not either your own or accurately attributed to its source. For

religious holiday, you must notify me at least 14 days in advance so we can make
