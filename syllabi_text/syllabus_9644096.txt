V. Course Requirements:
1. Class Attendance: Since this is a language course, regular attendance is very important. The first one
day (or two and a half hours) of absence will be excused and each absence thereafter will subtract 1 point
(out of 100) from your final grade per hour. Absences due to medical emergency can be excused with any
official proof such as a doctor’s notice, etc.
2. Homework will be given five times on a mostly weekly basis. Homework will be posted on Canvas
beforehand and a notice will be emailed to you. The due date for each homework is marked in the
tentative course schedule table on p. 3. If you cannot come to class on the due date, you can either submit
it via e-mail to the instructor or leave it in the drop box on the door of the instructor’s office. Homework
will be graded based on completion. Late homework will be accepted up to two days after the due date for
a partial credit. If anybody has any technical problems in downloading and printing out homework from
Canvas, ask for a hard copy from the instructor.
3. Quizzes will be given eight times, mostly twice a week. (See the tentative course schedule table on p. 3
for details). Each quiz will mainly test the basic vocabulary and expressions of the text covered in the
previous classes. The lowest scored quiz for each student will be dropped at the end of the course to
calculate the final grade.
4. Dictation Tests will be given eight times, mostly twice a week. (See the tentative course schedule table
on p. 3 for details). Each test covers the main text contents lectured about in the previous classes. The
lowest scored Dictation Test for each student will be dropped at the end of the course to calculate the final
grade.
5. Exams
        (a) Midterm Exams will be given on Monday, June 24; the Oral Midterm exam will be an oral
presentation of self-introduction, covering 10 % of the final grade, and the Written Midterm exam will
cover 10 % of the final grade.
         (b) Final Exams will be composed of an Oral Final Exam and a Written Final Exam. The Oral
Final exam is a skit presentation which will be given on the last class day, covering 10% of the final
grade. The Written Final Exam will be given at the designated time and location scheduled by the
University during the official final exam period, covering 15% of the final grade. The official final exam
time and the location for this class will be announced prior to the end of the course.
6. Makeup Policy: Any missed quizzes and dictation tests should be taken no later than a week from the
designated day and a partial credit will be given.
7. All announcements about the course and class information, class materials and assignments will be
posted on Canvas. Please make sure to check Canvas regularly. You can find support in using Canvas at
the ITS Help Desk at 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., so plan accordingly.

Notes
* Academic Integrity
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and
responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and
respect toward peers and community.
   Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code. [See the UT Honor Code above.]
Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. For this course,
collaboration is allowed in the following instances: group work in the classroom and the Oral final presentation work.
   You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other
students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible
cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the
form of an e mail, an e mail attachment file, a diskette, or a hard copy. Should copying occur, both the student who copied
work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the
assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary
action.
   During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may
you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations will
result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.
* By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a
religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious
holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
*In accordance with section 51.9111 of the Texas Education Code, a student is excused from attending classes or engaging in
other required activities, including exams, if he or she is called to active military service of a reasonably brief duration. The
student will be allowed a reasonable time after the absence to complete assignments and take exams.
* All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student notification policy. It is the student's
responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail
on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain
communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The
complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your e-mail address are available at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html.
* Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact Services for
Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty are not required to
provide accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.
     § Please notify me as quickly as possible if the material being presented in class is not accessible (e.g., instructional
          videos need captioning, course packets are not readable for proper alternative text conversion, etc.).
     § Please notify me as early in the semester as possible if disability-related accommodations for field trips are required.
          Advanced notice will permit the arrangement of accommodations on the given day (e.g., transportation, site
          accessibility, etc.).
     § Contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone) or reference

* Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
 If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by
 phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a partnership among the Office of
 the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The
