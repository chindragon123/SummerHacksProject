 3.     Assessment
      3.1.     Assessment activities
               and policies
Your course grade is determined by the following assessments.
           ●   Exams​: a midterm (25%) and a final (25%)
           ●   Quizzes​ (10%)
           ●   Instapolls​ (5%)
           ●   Final project​ (20%)
           ●   Review assignments​ (15%)
    ❏ Exams ​(50% total): There will be two exams. Exams are multiple choice questions and IDs. You
       will be responsible for all material covered in the assigned readings, recorded lectures, and other
       discussions.
               Midterm:​ ​Monday, July 29 at 7 pm in WAG 101
                ​Final:​ ​Finals period (August 17 or 19)​. This will be determined by the university soon.
           ● Exams are held on campus at the assigned time and place. If you have any scheduling
               conflicts, you should make arrangements at the beginning of the semester.
           ● If you need to take the exam off-campus, you must do so at a certified testing center at
               your own expense. Please arrange this two weeks in advance.
           ● Students with class conflicts or in need of other accommodations should notify the
               teaching team at least a week in advance to schedule a make up.
           ● Other make-ups are offered only in the event of a medical or personal emergency. We
               may request documentation of the emergency (like a doctor’s note, notification from
               Student Emergency Services, etc.)
           ● There is a survey built into the first module on Canvas (“Welcome to Class!”) where you
               can let us know if you need to make any of these special arrangements for the exam.
               Please fill out this survey as soon as possible.
           ● Please bring your student ID and a blank blue book to the exam. We will collect and
               redistribute blue books before the exam starts.
           ● Exams are not cumulative. The final will assess only the material covered since the
               midterm.
                                                                   SYLLABUS (CC303, 79905) SUMMER 2019      4


     ❏ Quizzes ​(10%): In Canvas modules, students will take various quizzes attached to assignments
        and lecture videos. Some will assess comprehension of readings; most will also deepen inquiry,
        providing contextual information and inviting further reflection. The lowest 2 quiz scores will be
        dropped at the end of the semester.
     ❏ Instapolls ​(5%): These are questions that are delivered within the lecture feed.
     ❏ Final project ​(20%): Each student will create a final project that analyzes, discusses, and
        creatively explores central course themes and/or texts. Instructions will be given after the
        midterm. The due date is August 12.
     ❏ Review assignments ​(15%): Each week, students will complete assignments that will prompt
        them to reflect and build comprehension of the week’s material. Most of these assignments will
        be on the platform Padlet. Instructions can be found within the Canvas review modules.
                                                                 3.3.      Late work policy

 6.     Other policies
       6.1.     Academic honesty
The teaching team will not tolerate any form of academic dishonesty. Please familiarize yourself with
the University of Texas’s Honor Code:
        “​The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
        individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold these
        values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.”​
Any student caught or facilitating cheating on any assignment will receive an F in the course and
immediately be referred to the Dean of Students. In cases where dishonesty is strongly suspected, I
reserve the right to re-examine the student(s). We will, however, assume absolute integrity on your part
until shown otherwise. If you are unsure what constitutes academic dishonesty, see
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis.php. It is your responsibility to be familiar with the
contents of this website and to avoid any behavior that might be interpreted as academic dishonesty.
        Online quizzes and other exercises​:
While taking online quizzes, you cannot receive help from others or discuss your writing assignments
with other students. If you observe others cheating, we request that you contact the teaching assistant
or instructor.
Online courses require means of supporting academic integrity that differ from traditional courses in
order to ensure fairness to all students. This course uses a software system intended to automatically
detect behavior that violates the course rules – for example, collaborating on a quiz or any graded work
with another student in any way not consistent with the syllabus and UT Austin Academic Integrity
Principles. As part of this effort,​ our system will occasionally result in students receiving email
notifications if any problematic behaviors are detected. ​These notifications are intended mainly to
remind students of the course code of conduct, and carry no automatic implications for a student or for
his or her grade in this course. ​If you receive such an email, it does NOT mean that you are under any
suspicion – it is an indication that the system has flagged a particular behavior or set of behaviors. ​We
will only investigate cases where our system determines that there is considerable evidence that the
code of conduct is not being followed.
        Plagiarism
Plagiarism: there is a substantial amount of writing in this course, so it is a good idea to familiarize
yourself with the University rules governing plagiarism:
(http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_plagiarism.php).
In general, avoid the following mistakes:
                                                                   SYLLABUS (CC303, 79905) SUMMER 2019        7


     ● copying word-for-word (or “verbatim”) any amount of material from the textbook, Canvas
        instructional material, or any other source (e.g. Wikipedia)
     ● failing to properly acknowledge borrowed material with the appropriate citation (usually
        acceptable in the form ​Author, page number​, e.g. “Boatwright, p. 32”)
     ● copying material with a few words or word order changed to avoid charges of verbatim copying
     ● unintentional plagiarism, through poor note-taking or forgetfulness
Paraphrasing material is acceptable, although even in this case you should cite the material you are
paraphrasing. In general, students should express their ideas using their own words and phrasing.
Students will be contacted in cases of suspected plagiarism; persistent violations will be cause for
referral to the Dean of Students.
If you feel overwhelmed by these guidelines or unsure about whether something is academically
dishonest, please reach out to the teaching team in office hours. Academic honesty policies are essential
for properly acknowledging and crediting each other’s ideas, and we want you to be well-equipped to
abide by them.
      6.2.      Add/drop policies
Students adding after the first class day should contact the teaching team as soon as possible to discuss
the possibility of completing any missed assignments. You are responsible for following the university's
official add/drop policies. Check the calendar for the 2019 Summer Session
(​https://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars/19summer​) for important deadlines.
UEX students: Please familiarize yourself with the University of Texas Extension School’s official
add/drop policy. Any requests to drop the course will be handled in accordance with these policies.
       6.3.     Technical requirements
All students are required to have access to an internet-enabled laptop or desktop computer. Support for
tablets and smartphones is not currently available from our technical support team, and students are
strongly discouraged from watching lectures on these devices. Your computer should meet the
following requirements:
     ● Computer laptop or desktop

        as a backup)
     ● Adobe Flash player: enabled and up-to-date
     ● Javascript enabledConfirm that your computer is able to stream the video lectures by visiting
