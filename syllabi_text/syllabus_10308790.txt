Course Description:
Television can be understood as a reflection of the American imaginary. It’s a conduit of creative
and political expression, a cultural forum that plays a role in defining communities, and a site
where ideas about race, ethnicity, class, gender, and citizenship are enacted on a national scale.
In this course we explore these various dynamics in scripted television in the United States from
the late 1940s through the present day. In addition to studying how racial and ethnic diversity and
also class, gender, and sexual orientation have been represented in entertainment television and
how various groups have participated in television production and consumption (and in advocacy
targeting networks and producers), contemporary debates and negotiations related to race, class,
gender, and sexual orientation and televisual representation and authorship will be explored. The
history of television studies and a variety approaches to television criticism rooted in the
contemporary humanities, social sciences, and cultural studies also will be surveyed throughout the
semester. This course carries UT’s Cultural Diversity flag. It focuses on the representation and
participation of African Americans, Latina/os, and Asian Americans in scripted television, as well as
on American Indians/Alaska natives, Arab/Muslim, Jewish, and European American representation
and the construction of “whiteness.” In addition, intersections of class, gender, sexual orientation, and
citizenship with race and ethnicity in televisual representation will be explored.
This course will often discuss readings and view screenings that address gender, sexuality, race,
religion, socioeconomics, etc. This classroom will be a safe space for these conscious discussions
and opinions. Any prejudices, bigotry, homophobia, transphobia, etc. will not be tolerated. Every
student’s discussions and opinions can of course be challenged but must be done respectfully.
Readings:
Most of your readings are compiled from multiple sources into a two-volume reading packet,
which we’ll start using the first full week of class. The rest of the readings will be posted to Canvas
or through links posted to Canvas. The course reader is available for purchase at Jenn’s Copies, 2518
Guadalupe (on Guadalupe, across the street from the CMA building). A copy of the course packet
also will be on reserve for 2-hour checkout in the Perry Castañeda Library (PCL) Reserves.
Course Requirements
This course consists of three 50-minute classes per week, weekly screenings, and several outside
assignments. The reading and outside assignments will require a regular allotment of time outside of


class each week. Your progress will be assessed through your participation in class discussions and
reading responses, three writing assignments, a midterm exam, and a group research project/paper.
Grading Breakdown:
Participation – 10%. This grade will be based on taking an active part in class and faithful
attendance. As you know, this course will explore the representation of race, ethnicity, gender, class,
and sexual orientation in U.S. television and popular culture. While there are
some facts, research, and scholarly opinions that I’ll share with you on these topics, the meanings of
such representation are created by all of us and are the subject of ongoing debate. For this reason,
everyone’s participation is important to what I consider a successful class. I strongly encourage you
to share your reactions to the course material in class, as well as any questions that arise. Please also
let me or the TA know either in or outside class when the reading is difficult to understand or if you
are struggling with sharing your responses.
Respectful listening and treatment of your fellow classmates and the course instructors also is a
component of optimal participation in class. Keep in mind that we all come from very different
backgrounds and will have similarly different perspectives; in my mind a successful class is one in
which we feel comfortable sharing our various viewpoints and learning from one another.
Response Postings - 10%. Beginning the third week of class, by Monday or Wednesday before
class every week (based on if you’re in Group 1 (A-L last names: Post Mondays) or Group 2 (M-Z
last names: post Wednesdays)), you’ll be expected to post an entry to our Canvas site responding to a
dimension or part of the reading which you found to be of particular interest. These entries can be
brief—150-250 words —and should consist of a comment, question, or connection you made based
on personal experience. Be sure to respond at least partially to a reading from that week in your
entries; you additionally can respond to the week’s screening or discuss relevant things you’re seeing
on television (or television clips on YouTube or other sites) or in the news. When possible, I’ll use
your postings as jumping off points for class discussion.
If class meets only one day in a week, both groups are expected to post on that day class meets.
You do get one “freebie” week of your choosing when you don’t have to post, and there are no
reading responses due the week of the midterm exam. In all, try to post 10 times during the
semester. You’ll be graded on a 3-point scale for each post.
Midterm Exam – 20%. This exam will consist of true/false, multiple-choice, and short-answer
questions and one essay question and will cover material outlined in the lectures, readings,
screenings, and class discussions in roughly the first half of the semester.
Assignments - 35% (three short papers - worth 5, 15, and 15%). The three writing assignments
will consist of a Personal Television Memories paper, a television episode critique, and a network or
producer critique. Assignment guidelines will be passed out in class well before each assignment is
due. If you have difficulties with your writing, I encourage you come to my office hours, the TA’s
office hours, or to work with someone from the University Writing Center throughout the semester.
Group Research Project – 25%. In groups of four or five, you will conduct a research project
related to race, class, gender, or sexual orientation and television in the last half of the semester.
Over a period of a month, your group will explore a research question of your choosing; each
person in the group will focus on one aspect of the topic. This project will entail either historical
research, taking as a jumping off point one or more readings for this class, or a critique of a


television network or television series, with a focus on race, ethnicity, class, gender, or sexual
orientation. Other options could be a study of audience response to a television series or network,
an exploration of media advocacy focused on television network or series, or research on web-based
series production.
Group assignments will be made by lottery. You’ll be asked to turn in a Group Research Worksheet
to propose your group’s project and research question (a question you’d like to try to answer), and to
specify how each person in the group will undertake some aspect of exploring the question. Your
group will be asked to create a research blog; each member should make regular posts on the work
they are doing and overall progress in attempting to answer the research question. Your group’s blog
will be checked twice during the five weeks that you’ll be gathering information for your project.
Groups will make final presentations during the last week of class, when everyone will also turn in a
summary of your research projects and findings and a confidential assessment of how everyone in
your group contributed. You will receive separate grades based on your individual contributions.
More guidelines for this project will be passed out later in the semester.
Class Policies
Grading system: This class will be graded using the following letter grade system: A (93%+), A-
(90-92%), B+ (88-89%), B (83-87%), B- (80-82%), C+ (78-79%), C (70-77%), D (60-69%), F (less
than 60%).
Late assignments will be penalized ½ a letter grade per day late.
Attendance: Class attendance is mandatory. Excused absences include absences discussed in
advance for religious holidays, or absences related to serious illness. Please let me know via email if
you ever have to miss a class. If you miss an assignment due to an excused absence you will be given
an opportunity to complete it within a reasonable time afterward. Each student is granted two
personal leave credits during the semester, meant to be used for emergencies that keep you away
from class, after which your participation grade will be lowered by a half letter grade for each
unexcused absence. Excessive tardiness also will result in grade sanctions, so be sure to arrive on
time and to let me know if you will have to be late for class.
The class screenings are like assigned books in a literature course; for this reason, attendance at
screenings is mandatory (unless excused prior to the screening). If you do have to miss a
screening, be sure to arrange with Dr. Sebro to watch what you’ve missed before the next class.
Academic Integrity. Each student is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As
a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and
uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or
ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in a previous class), you must cite your sources.
Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including
failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the
University Honor Code: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php.
Name and Personal Pronoun Preferences. Class rosters are provided to me with your legal name. I
will honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official
roster, and by the gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of this preference
early in the semester.

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally
funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working
environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our
community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
become involved in a Title IX investigation.


3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies. Faculty members and
certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters,”
which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a
Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing,
discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title
IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak
with someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options
and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.

Scholastic Dishonesty: The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism,
unauthorized collaboration, falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid
participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not
limited to, providing false or misleading information to receive a postponement or an extension
on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same written assignment
for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you
have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonest damages both
the student’s learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students
who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. For more
information on scholastic dishonesty, please visit the Student Judicial services Web site at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs.
