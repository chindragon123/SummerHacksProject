Attendance, Preparedness and Participation
• This class only meets 15 times in the semester, so attendance at every session is required. If
you miss class, you will lose the participation point for that day, and must find a way to submit
your written homework to me as soon as possible.
• You are expected to be prepared for each week’s session. Expect to be called on in class, such
as to recite/read aloud, answers questions, etc.
• Voluntary participation will be considered as part of this grade, i.e. offering to read, offering
answers, etc.
Homework
• Homework must be submitted at the end of the class period that it is due.
• Homework must be handwritten, neatly, in pen, on standard loose-leaf lined paper.
• Homework must be organized in the same order as in the textbook, and the title and page
number of the exercise must appear above each answer set. Only one answer per line. Each
answer must be numbered.
• Each homework assignment must include a heading, including the following: your name,
assignment chapter, specific assignment, due date, and submission date.
• If your homework takes more than one page, it must be stapled. (No tape, no bent corners,
etc.)


• All Arabic homework must include full vocalization (taskhkīl, voweling).
• Homework will primarily be graded on completeness, timeliness, and adherence to format
rules described here.
• Be prepared to share your homework with other students for grading/correction, and also to
read answers aloud.
IMPORTANT: Tackling the Material
• Read each chapter carefully. Make sure you understand every point.
• Learn all vocabulary introduced in each chapter. Do as follows:
- Group words into nouns, adjectives, verbs, prepositions, adverbs, and particles. Learn words
in their groups.
- Use the five “senses” of language learning: speaking, listening, reading, writing, imagining.
• Test your passive recall and your active recall of vocabulary.
