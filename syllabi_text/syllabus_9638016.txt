Text: Introduction to the Practice of Statistics 9th edition by Moore McCabe Craig. (The
sections on probability are largely review, so we’ll cover them more quickly than the sections
containing new material.)
The text will be supplemented with occasional lectures and/or notes going into the more
mathematical aspects of the subject. (The hardcopy of the text is optional)
LaunchPad for Introduction to the Practice of Statistics 9th edition is required:

ADVICE FOR SUCCESS
Actively participate in the course by attending lectures, asking questions, doing the assigned
homework problems and additional problems covering your weak topics, and utilizing my office
hours. Please do come to my office hours if you have questions or concerns.
Before you email me to ask a question about the rules and procedures of this course, please read
through this syllabus to see if the answer is written here. I diligently tried to include here any
information that you might ask; please utilize it.
Nature of the course: Statistics is a mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics.
Thus this course will have many aspects of a typical math course, but many aspects that are not
typical of math courses. Some things to expect:
- In many problems, you will need to combine common sense and everyday knowledge with
mathematical and/or statistical techniques.
- Some questions on homework and exams will not have one correct answer; your grade on such
questions will depend largely on the case you make for your answer, rather than just on the
answer itself.
- As the semester progresses, your statistical vocabulary will grow, and I will expect you to use
this new vocabulary on assignments.
- Writing carefully and precisely is important.
- Class participation is expected.
- You will be expected to do a group project.


HONOR CODE: The class is expected to uphold The University of Texas at Austin Honor
Code (Links to an external site.). The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are
learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each
member of the University is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust,
fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
UNAUTHORIZED COPYING: You cannot share any assignment, handout, or document
related to this class. Sharing any class materials online in any form, including the homework and
assignments you submitted, without my express approval is considered academic dishonesty. If
something is found online which you have posted, you will be reported for academic dishonesty
to Student Judicial Services.
QUANTITATIVE REASONING: This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag.
Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for
understanding the types of quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your adult and
professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from
your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
ATTENDANCE POLICY
You are expected to attend all lecture sessions. If you are absent, do not email or otherwise
contact me to ask what material we covered during class, what the assignments are, what
sections the exams will cover, or any other questions that I have answered or will answer during
class. In such a situation, you should contact a classmate to get notes and information for the
class you missed. It is certainly a good idea to work together throughout the semester.
Grading:
Homework                              14%
MC Quizzes                            3%
Learning Curves                       5%
Project                               2%
Exam 1 (Chapters)                    23%
Exam 2 (Chapters)                    23%
Exam 3 (Chapters)                    30%
There will be no make-ups on mid-semester exams. If you have an excused absence on a mid-
semester exam, I will count your final exam grade in place of the missing exam grade.
I will not give you an excused absence unless (a) you request one as soon as feasible (before the
exam if that is possible) and (b) the absence was for a good cause (oversleeping or having other
exams or papers due that day or week are not considered good cause.)
As mentioned, grading will be based not just on the final answer or on calculations, but also on
the reasoning shown in arriving at your final answer. You must write conclusions on every
problem.


Grading Scale: (I will not round or bump)
Plus/minus grades will be assigned for the final grade as follows: A (100-92.6), A- (92.5-89.6),
B+ (89.5-86.6), B (86.5-82.6), B- (82.5-79.6), C+ (79.5-76.6), C (76.5-72.6), C- (72.5-69.6), D+
(69.5-66.6), D (66.5-62.6), D- (62.5-59.6), F (59.5-0).
Homework: Assigned by lecture. I will not grade any disorganized or difficult-to-read assignments.
Your homework is your best piece of work -- do it every day. I will not accept homework on loose sheets
of paper. I can address only a few homework questions during class due to the short time we have to
cover the syllabus, so I encourage everyone to visit me during office hours.
Homework is due every Tuesdays and Fridays in class.
No late homework under any circumstances.
If you feel there is a typo on any homework grade or electronic quiz you must email me before
the day of the final exam.
Homework format:
- Stapled and no ripped pages from a notebook.
- Your name at the top of each page.
- The first page should state the class, section number, instructor's name, and book sections included in
the homework assignment.
- Label each question clearly, specifying the section and the exercise number (i.e. 4.1 #32)
- Homework should be organized, clean, and easy to read.
- Show all work. Answers in the back of the book are summaries, condensed to fit in as little space as
possible. Do not use them as models for written homework.
- Write in complete sentences and pay attention to correct use of the vocabulary pertinent to this course.
- It is not satisfactory to provide lonely computer output. Every computer output needs to be
explained or interpreted.
Computer Software: You will need to use computer software. The default software for this
class is R. I will provide instructions on using R in class.
Exams dates (see Calendar on Canvas):
Test 1 Wednesday, June 19th
Test 2 Monday, July 1st
Test 3 TBA

COMPUTER LAB
The mathematics department's 40 seats undergrad computer lab, RLM 7.122, is open to
all students enrolled in math courses. Students can sign up for an individual account themselves
in the computer lab using their UT EID.
STUDENT CONDUCT
All computers, cell phones and other hand-held devices must be put away out of sight and sound
during class. You will be excused from class for the day if you are using your phone, laptop,
tablet, etc. Please come to class on time. If you will be late or need to leave early for some
legitimate reason, please tell me in advance. Coming and going during class is distracting to your
fellow students and the instructor, and we do not like it.
PLANNED LECTURE and EXAM SCHEDULE:
Deviations from this tentative calendar may occur during the semester. The actual material
covered each day can only be determined by attending the lectures.
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
DEADLINES FOR DROPPING A COURSE
If you drop a class on or before the 12th class day, the class will not show up on your transcript.
If you drop a class after that date, the course will show up on the transcript with a "Q" grade.
EMERGENCY EVACUATION POLICY
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you
may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing
during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or
class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin
Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention
Services office.
