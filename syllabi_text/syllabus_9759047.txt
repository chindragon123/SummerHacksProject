 Abstract
          An introduction to design process, formal design principles, visual storytelling, and
concept ideation.
 Objectives
 •    Categorize and combine visual storytelling elements and principles into actionable design
      strategies.
 •    Critically analyze aesthetic applications and theoretical issues within contemporary design via
      questioning, close observation, and problem solving.
 •    Identify the essence of a composition in terms of its formal structure and symbolic languages.
 •    Translate concept ideation into prototypes through design thinking methodology.
 •    Develop productive design process habits such as communication, delegation, prioritizing and
      sequencing tasks when working in groups.
 •    Develop strategies in visual storytelling to communicate with a target audience.
                                                                                                        1


  Assessment
 This course is a language course and a process course. The focus is on learning and using the Design
 Aesthetics/Principles and the Design Variables/Elements. The course content is cumulative. The
 more you integrate the design language the more effective you become in visual and verbal design
 communications.
 There are 2 exams that are worth 10% each.
 You will use the language of design to collaborate with your fellow students (guilds) to create small
 projects (Knowledge Transfer Activities) designed to personalize the vocabulary by using it in
 exploratory analysis of professional entertainment properties.
A final KTA will be an individual personal project that will include a poster about your Design
 Process. The final project and poster together are worth 30%.
                  30% Design Curation Blog DCB
                  20% Open Ended Questions (OEQ) posted on blog
                  20% Two exams worth 10% each
                  30% Final Knowledge Transfer Artifact project with documentation on DCB.
 No late work will be accepted. No incompletes will be given. If you feel you will not be able to
 complete all work on time, you should contact your guild to turn in your deliverables.
 If you catch the flu, get a flat tire, are abducted by aliens, or otherwise cannot attend
 class, get in touch with your guild and deliver your part of any project on time.
 Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following scale. The University does not
 recognize the grade of A+.
                  Letter grade equivalents:
                   A = 94-100                        C+ = 77-79                        D+ = 67-69
                   A- = 90-93                        C = 74-76                         D = 64-66
                   B+ = 87-89                        C- = 70-73                        D- = 60-63
                   B = 84-86                                                           F = 0-60
                   B- = 80-83
                                                                                                       2


Classroom Policy
      Devices
            ● Must be kept in silent mode unless an emergency notification is expected.
            ● Can be used for research and class note taking, but not for social media
               (unless related to class activities)
      Food/Drink
            ● Food is not allowed in class.
            ● Drinks in closed containers are permitted but must be kept on the floor
               or out of sight when not in use.
Required Equipment
       Bring Internet-connecting devices for research and collaboration.
       Have a sharable cloud space for collaboration with fellow students.
       You will create a blog on the platform of your choice.
UT Electronic Mail Notification Policy
      Electronic mail (e-mail) is a mechanism for official University and instructor
      communication to students. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and
      regular basis in order to stay current with University- and course-related communications,
      recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-
      mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week.
      It is the responsibility of every student to keep the University and instructor informed
      of changes in his or her official e-mail address (do so at
      https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/bio/address_change.WBX).
      Consequently, e-mail returned to the University with "User Unknown" is not an
      acceptable excuse for missed communication. Similarly, undeliverable messages
      returned because of a full inbox or use of a spam filter will be considered delivered
      without further action required of the University or instructor. (see
      http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy)
Use of Class Materials
      The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, and
      homework assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the
      class materials is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being
      taken against the student. Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific,
      express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor
      Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.
      This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of
      sharing those materials with other current or future students. (from
      https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/coursematerials/Sample+Use+Statement+for+Syllabus)
                                                                                                    3


Attendance/Absences
      Attendance is tied directly to your grade. Missing a class will result in a zero grade for
      that day. If attending a scheduled class meeting is not possible, students are expected
      to promptly notify the instructor of extenuating circumstances (hospitalization, death
      in the family, etc.). In addition, see the exception below for religious holy days.
      Arriving more than ten minutes late at the beginning of class or after a break, leaving
      class without permission, and leaving class prior to dismissal for the day all count as
      being tardy. Points will be deducted from your grade for each of these occurrences.
Religious Holidays
      Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code states that a student shall be excused from
      attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
      observance of a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose
      absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and
      shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the
      student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence.
      University policy requires students to notify each of their instructors at least fourteen days
      prior to the date they will be absent from scheduled classes to observe a religious holy
      day.
      (from http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/1555_001.pdf)
Q Drop Policy
      The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for
      academic reasons to six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:“Beginning with the fall 2007
      academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit an undergraduate
      student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer
      student has dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student
      shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
Classroom Etiquette
      Please observe the following rules during class as a courtesy to fellow students and
      the instructor. These will have an impact on your grade, so it is important that you
      follow these guidelines...
      1) Be on time at the beginning of class. If you must come in late at the beginning of
      class, please enter the room and seat yourself as quietly and unobtrusively as possible.
      2) Turn your cell phone off, or on silent, and put it away. Looking at your cell phone
      during lectures, exercises and discussions is not acceptable. Use your computer for
      taking notes, not your cell phone.
                                                                                                     4


    3) Don’t distract other students. Please leave the room to dance, sing, gossip, tell jokes,
     etc.
    4) Headphones and sunglasses are not allowed to be worn during lectures,
     exercises, or discussions. Even if your headphones are not playing music, they
     should not be in your ears during these times.
Academic Integrity
    The University's Honor Code states that “As a student of The University of Texas at
     Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.”
     You are expected to maintain absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor
     in scholastic work undertaken at the University. At a minimum, you should complete
     any assignments, exams, and other scholastic endeavors with the utmost honesty,
     which requires you to:
          ● acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts;
          ● complete your assignments independently unless expressly authorized to seek or
             obtain assistance in preparing them;
          ● follow instructions for assignments and exams, and observe the standards
             of your academic discipline; and
          ● avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or
             another student.
             (adapted from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php)
Academic Dishonesty
     In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines
     academic dishonesty as including any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved
     academic advantage, such as:
          o Cheating
          o Plagiarism
          o Unauthorized Collaboration / Collusion
          o Falsifying Academic Records
          o Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam,
             obtain an extended deadline for an assignment)
          o Multiple submissions (submitting essentially the same written assignment for two
             courses without authorization to do so)
          o Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic
             integrity
          o (adapted from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php)
          o Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to
             disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or
             dismissal from the University.
             (from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_faculty_syllabus.php)
                                                                                                5


Plagiarism
       “Plagiarism” includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation of, buying, receiving as a
       gift, or obtaining by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to
       another source, including words, ideas, illustrations, structure, computer code, and
       other expression or media, and presenting that material as one’s own academic work
       being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program course requirement (from Sec.
       11-402, http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-
       discipline-and-con duct/).
 Copyright and Fair Use
       Understanding the basic principles of copyright and fair use is of critical importance to
       designers. Many of the uses we will make of texts, images, and videos this semester will
       be covered by the doctrine of fair use. However, as creators, you need to be aware of
       your own and other copyright holders’ legal rights, and to properly identify and license
       your own and others’ works. We will discuss these issues during the semester as needed,
       but when you have questions about whether or when you can appropriate someone
       else’s work, a useful resource is Georgi K. Harper’s Copyright Crash Course, available at
       http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/.
 Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD)
       The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
       accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact

Process
Blog (DCB)
•   Your Design Curation Blog (DCB) will house your Open-Ended Questions (OEQ), Trailer links
    and observational paragraphs. All content on your Design Curation Blog (DCB) should focus
    ONLY on AET315 materials.
•   Required numbered posts should be identified with DCB_1, DCB_2 etc.
•   Your open-ended questions will become your mid-term and final exams.
•   Yes, you can be creative in your DCB. Personalize and illustrate your posts as your learning
    journey in Design Foundations and Visual Storytelling.
Trailer Dive Observational Paragraphs
1. Identify 2 (or more) aspects of the topic of the day in one trailer from your industry
2. Post your trailer and an observational paragraph discussing ways in which the designers of
    the trailer used aspects of the daily topic.
Guilds & KTAs
Students draw a card from the topics in the unit. All students with the same topic card form a
guild.
The future is designed. You are the designers of the future.
No matter what the industry, Design Lore must be transferred from one generation of
designers to the next in modes that are meaningful, useful, and engaging.
Guilds create Knowledge Transfer Activities (KTAs) to be used by future novice designers to
increase their design powers as they rise through professional levels. KTAs will help to develop
industry communication prowess.
