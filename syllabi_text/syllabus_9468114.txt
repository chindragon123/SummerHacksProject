Course Description
This course examines a variety of Japanese popular manga and anime, focusing mainly on
those works Japan has exported since becoming an economic superpower in the 1980s. We
will explore utopian/dystopian expression in Japanese sci-fi narratives, examine the ways that
the Japanese entertainment industry has responded to changing notions of gender, and chart
the evolution of traditional genre categories as they accommodate new hybridic representations
of the posthuman body. We will also consider the significance of global fandom with the rise of
the transnational otaku, and its relevance to Japan’s exercise of soft power.
Required Texts
Anime: A Critical Introduction (AACI), Denison, Rayna (2015)

Course Objectives:
     ● Students will read, view, analyze, interpret, and write critically about contemporary
        Japanese popular media.
     ● Students will learn to perform close textual analysis, and write about their findings while
        considering external factors, such as audience reception and cultural contexts.
     ● Students will demonstrate their ability to visually decode complex media messages with
        culturally specific meanings through discussions and written tests.
     ● Students will conduct original research on a topic relevant to the study of Japanese
        popular culture, and write a seminar paper demonstrating their findings.


Course Work:
Students will be expected to view the films listed in the schedule below outside of class. I am
placing each of the titles on reserve at the Fine Arts Library, but if you have another way to view
them you are more than welcome to do so in whatever way works best for you. In addition,
there are readings listed in the schedule, which you should read before the class where they are
listed. Many of the readings will come from the required textbooks, but I have made others
available on the Canvas site. There will also be discussion questions for each week that may
pertain to the readings or film. Sometimes we will collect these and count what you hand in
toward your class participation grade. You will be told ahead of time if we plan to collect your
responses. In addition, there will be quizzes at the end of each unit. The quiz questions will be
drawn from material we have reviewed in class and will be given in multiple formats (T/F, FITB,
multiple choice, short ID, etc.). A cumulative final exam will be given at the end of the class,
and students will write a paper of 2000-2,500 words consisting of original research on a topic
related to Japanese popular culture to be due on the last day of class.
Course Schedule:
Below is the list of screenings and readings for each week of class. In addition, assignments,
readings, and other information can be found on the Canvas website at
https://utexas.instructure.com. Changes to the schedule may be made if circumstances
require. I will do my best to ensure that you receive the changes with as much advanced notice
as possible, but please check the Canvas site regularly to stay informed.

Grading Policies
Flexibility is built into the assignments to support your success in this course. If you miss a

Consequently, the final grades are firm, and no additional curve is available.

77-79.9 = C+                                           below 60 = F
Absences
Excused Absence: The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious
holidays or extenuating circumstances due to an emergency. If you plan to miss class due to
observance of a religious holiday, please let us know at least two weeks in advance. You will
not be penalized for this absence, although you will still be responsible for any work you will
miss on that day if applicable. Check with us for details or arrangements.
                                                   5


If you have to be absent, ask a classmate for notes on any lessons you miss. If you find there
are topics that we covered while you were gone that raise questions, you may come by during
office hours or schedule a meeting to discuss. Email specific questions you have in advance
so that we can make the most of our time. “What did I miss?” is not specific enough.
Student Rights & Responsibilities
Students have a right to an inclusive learning environment where they are respected, graded
fairly, provided with opportunities to freely express opinions, and guaranteed privacy and
confidentiality where appropriate. In return, each of us is responsible for treating others with
respect, listening courteously and doing our best to make the learning environment supportive
to all. If you are feeling that the class is not meeting this standard, please let the instructor or
TA know so that the issue can be addressed as quickly as possible.
Names & Personal Pronouns
      Class rosters are provided to the instructor with students’ legal name. I will gladly honor
      your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of
      this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my
      records.
University Policies
Academic Integrity
      Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
      “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the
      University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT.
      Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in
      previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and
      subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible
      for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be
      found at the following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the
Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you
are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more
information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
                                                   6

Counseling and Mental Health Center
         There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the
         college experience is learning how to ask for help. If you or anyone you know
         experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
         depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of
Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
requires exiting and assembling outside.
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing
during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or
class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin
Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention
Services office. Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency
procedures can be found at: www.utexas.edu/emergency
Title IX Reporting
     Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual
     harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at
     federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and
     working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct
     occurs in our community, the university can:
               1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
               2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have
               experienced harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
               3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
     Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
     “Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to
     the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX
     related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking
     with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask
     whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or
     remedies without making an official report to the university, email
     advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and resources,
     visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
