I. Course description
What can we learn about Latin American social worlds when we look at the place of Jews within
it? Conversely, what we learn about Jewish social worlds when they unfold in Latin America?
This course examines both of these questions. Specifically, we consider the role of Latin America
as both a refuge from and a source of anti-Semitism, a hub of immigration, a site of Zionism, and
of Jewish success and philanthropy. We also address themes of displacement, longing,
belonging, marginalization, prejudice, immigration, community, cultural continuity, and
memory, while considering Sephardi and Ashkenazi difference, and inter-generational conflict
among Jewish Latin Americans. Overall, through reading, writing exercises, independent
research and in-class films, the course is designed to provide students with an understanding of
how Jews constructed individual lives and vibrant communities in predominantly Hispanic,
Catholic countries of Latin America.
With these themes in mind, the course is divided into four units: 1) Historical literacy is a
substantive introductory unit, which provides basic context from 1492 until the post-World War
II period; 2) Jewish group identities in Latin American features readings on Jewish life and
cultural forms in select national contexts (e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Dominican Republic and
others); 3) Memoir and personal narrative engages students in critical reading of creative non-
fiction and ethnography that focuses on individual lives; 4) Contemporary realities explores
current events, contemporary trends and popular culture in Jewish Latin America. Finally, over
the course of the semester, drawing on course motifs, students will produce their own research
papers addressing a specific research question in the Latin American national context of their
choice. 4) Writers’ Workshop: Unlike many undergraduate courses after which students submit
a rushed final paper that they never see again, we will be drafting and revising sections of the
final paper during the in-class writing workshops with the goal producing a cohesive, polished,
final product. Note that during part IV, there no reading assigned, so students’ energies will be
directed towards individual research and improving drafts in and out of the classroom.

Note: This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices,
beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
II. Required Texts (Available for purchase at the Co-op bookstore):
The Other 1492: Jewish Settlement in the New World by Norman H. Finkelstein (iUniverse
         2001)
The Jews of Latin America by Judith Laikin Elkin (2nd Edition, Scholarly Publishing Office,
University of Michigan Library 2011)
Pomegranate Seeds: Latin American Jewish Tales by Nadia Grosser Nagarajan (University of
         New Mexico Press 2005)
Kosher Feijoada and Other Paradoxes of Jewish Life in São Paulo by Misha Klein
         (University Press of Florida, 2012)
Recommended materials:
-One clearly labelled notebook dedicated exclusively to taking hand-written notes related for
this course.
-A pen that is satisfying to write with, and always easy to locate at the beginning of class.
III. Course objectives:
Upon completion of the course, students will have developed the written, oral and recall skills to
be able to:
● Explain when, how, and why Jews arrived to Latin America
● Articulate central themes of the Jewish Latin American experience over time
● Place course themes within in a wider context of anthropological theory
● Converse, with historical and ethnographic sensitivity, about a range of contemporary social
issues for Jews in the region
● Gain greater familiarity with specific national contexts through independent research and
writing project
IV. Course Design and Format
This course, which will be run in a seminar-style format, is recommended for motivated lower-
division undergraduate who are developing an intellectual interest Jewish Studies and/or Latin
American Studies. It is run as series of lively, fast-paced, interactive meetings in which students
are encouraged to articulate and synthesize ideas with clarity, accuracy and sensitivity, and
defend positions through evidence based on a common reading list. Discussion leaders,
designated weekly, will raise questions, stimulate debate, and integrate ideas from the readings
and course core concepts into our collective analysis. I will be asking for your feedback regularly
so there is an open flow of communication and room for improvement during the semester. This
course is also unusual in that it was designed in consultation with UT students who are familiar
with the tastes, pace and interests of fellow students.
The weekly cycle:
Tues- A small team of students, delegated in advance, will facilitate the discussion along with
the instructor, raising questions, stimulating debate, and integrating ideas from the readings
into the collective analysis.
                                                    2


Tue- An instructor-led discussion further establishes the context and background for the
readings and outlines their key data, arguments and ideas in the reading.
A note on attendance, contribution, and classroom vibe: Regular attendance is not only the key
to your own success as a student in this course, but also for the quality of the course as a
dynamic whole. Arriving late and leaving early disrupts class flow, so make every effort to arrive
to class on time with your materials prepared. Students place their phones on silent and deposit
them at the front of classroom when they enter each day, and all course notes are taken by
hand in a notebook unless you provide a note from SSD. This is a low-tech, highly interpersonal
seminar.
IMPORTANT NOTE ON ABSENCES: After 3 absences, your final grade will be lowered two
percentage points (-2%) for each additional absence after that.
V. Overview of Requirements:
● Overall Participation (10%) Students will be graded on their regular, active, intellectually
rigorous contribution to the seminar component of the course, and evidence of careful reading
of assigned texts.
● Discussion leadership (5%): A group of students, delegated in advance, facilitate the
discussion or an activity along with the instructor, raising questions, stimulating debate, and
integrating ideas from the readings into the collective analysis. You will do this once during the
semester. Participating in class more generally, as a formal leader or otherwise, has a positive
influence on your grade. I will generally grade the partners together unless there are individuals
who contributed significantly less or more.
● One memo (5%): When you lead discussion (with your group), each individual in that group
mem that poses a question, and then answers that question based on the reading for that day.
These memos will help students navigate the course content and prepare for exams. They also
provide a low-stakes sneak preview of how I grade writing before your final paper is due.
Memo format:
a) State your question clearly in bold font
b) Provide a 200-250 word answer, citing the text
c) Pose 2 discussion questions designed to be engaging, thought provoking and informative and
related to themes in the reading. Come prepared to share your ideas in class.
d) ) Proofread and cite: Remember, even if the assignment is short, write clearly and proofread
as carefully as you would for any graded assignment. Include page citations and a literature
cited at the bottom of the page
The memo will be graded on its writing quality, attention to facts, examples and details that
appear in the assigned reading for the day reading, as well your thoughtfulness and insight. Feel
free to be creative, and include reflections, reactions, critical commentaries as well as basic
answers overviews. The memo is due to me as email attachment (Word or Google doc.) on
Wed. 9pm sharp the evening before your student group leads discussion. Bring a printed copy
for your own reference on the day you lead. I hold these memos papers to the same standards
as all papers in the class, including a literature cited.
                                                    3


● Final paper (30%): A 5-7 page (12 pt. font, Times New Roman, double-spaced, 1-inch margins)
paper based on a proposal that combines history, theory, and cultural analysis.
● 2 Tests (25% each) will include the following question format and point values:
15 multiple choice                 (2 points each=30 points)
15 fill-in-the blank               (2 points each=30 points)
5 short answer questions           (5 points each=25 points)
1 short essay                      (1 essay      =15 points)
Note on test content: One week prior to the test, I have students post two questions they would
like to see appear on the on blackboard, and often draw up to 80% of test content from student
suggestions! These suggested questions also prove useful for students when studying and
preparing for tests. All tests include 3 points worth of extra credit at the end that allow you to
showcase careful reading for details or special attentiveness to class discussion.

IX. Important Notes on Grading Policy and Support for Students:
Complete written assignments on time: I am committed to returning assignments to you
promptly so you can benefit from my feedback while material is fresh in your mind. I do not
grade papers or exams until I have the entire printed set in front of me. For these reasons, I do
not accept late assignments. Bring a hard copy at the beginning of class on the day it is due. If
                                                  4


you anticipate a problem, or have a history of deadline problems, meet with a consultant at the
learning or writing center to help you plan ahead.
The UT Learning Center: http://www.utexas.edu/student/utlc/
Undergraduate Writing Center: http://uwc.utexas.edu/
Grading policy: I am very happy to discuss how you may improve your work, and will read early
drafts, but I will not reconsider grades on papers or tests. I grade all the papers in a set to
ensure that I am applying the same standards, and I make every effort to be fair.
Plagiarism and copying: Although this course is designed for creative, individual work and
synthesis of ideas from various sources, any work submitted by a student in this course for
academic credit must be the student's own work. Should copying occur from another student,
both the student who copied work and the student who gave material to be copied will both
automatically receive a zero for the assignment.
Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and
University disciplinary action. Here are University statements about plagiarism and the
consequences of plagiarizing:

Using office hours, getting help: I check email regularly, and will usually reply to emails within 24
hours for basic questions, and no longer than three days for more complicated ones. I have
flexible office hours that are available by appointment.
