 something to you. And you can tell if that's working for you.” ― David Lynch

Attendance
• Attendance is taken at the beginning of every class.
• Class attendance is a requirement and use of the full class period is expected.
• You will be allowed three sick, personal, physical or mental health days without
     grading consequences.
• Two instances of tardiness or early departure equal one absence.
• 15 minutes late to the start of class will constitute a tardy.
• At the end of each class, tardy students must make instructor aware of their attendance
     or they will be marked as absent.
• Leaving class before being dismissed by your professor will constitute an early
     departure.
• A class in which a student is tardy and departs early on the same day is considered an
     absence.
• A 4th absence will result in the lowering of your final grade by one letter grade.
• Absences, tardiness and/or early departures beyond this could result in course failure.
• If a serious medical or personal situation occurs affecting attendance, please discuss it
     with your professor.
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor
Code: “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core
values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very
seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that
you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be
guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of
the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the
University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before
the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under
Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas
institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because
we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or
exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to
meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. There are also a range of
resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If
there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you
have medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific


arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am
committed to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do
so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the
confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact:
Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video
phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is
learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or
feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Learning Center each year to improve their academic performance? All students are
welcome to take advantage of Sanger Center’s classes and workshops, private learning
specialist appointments, peer academic coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses in
15 different subject areas. For more information, please visit http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/slc

The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of
Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
requires exiting and assembling outside.
  •   Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may
      occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when


  entering the building.
• Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing
  during the first week of class.
• In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do
  not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
  Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention
  Services office.
