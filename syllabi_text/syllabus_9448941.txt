“An architect operating under essentialism would extract from a natural system such as a honeycomb all that is
invariant, an essential hexagonal cell, seeing all that departs from it in the model as error or accident. We
recognize those preserved errors as inherently systematic as any pure geometry, the result of influences from the
context or from within the system itself.” Resier + Umemoto, Atlas of Novel Tectonics
"Beautiful is an adjective that we often employ to indicate something that we like. What is beautiful is the same as
what is good, and in fact in various historical periods there was a close link between the Beautiful and the Good...A
beautiful thing is something that would make us happy if it were ours, but remains beautiful even if it belongs to
someone else." Umberto Eco, History of Beauty

COURSE DESCRIPTION
Design processes are rapidly evolving as new programs are co‐opted from other industries and
technological advancements change the way we build. This class will look at the experimental
application of digital tools to develop new tactics for design. Students will develop a series of digital
models using an evolutionary design approach, rapidly producing a large number of iterations. Select
models will be embedded with procedurally driven surface systems and further modified using texture
mapping techniques. Finally, students will create a short animated film for their final project.
The class is divided into 4 project‐based assignments. Each assignment builds on the completion of the
previous one through an integrative design process. Each student will develop one object (defined
loosely) over the course of the semester that will be continually modified, updated, and calibrated
through constant feedback and exchange. Students will develop a project agenda with specific goals
informed by an analysis of the object itself. The qualities that emerge through the design process will
provide a framework for the further development of the project and a tool for evaluation. The agenda


will not be one of optimization. Rather, students will develop a multi‐layered and multi‐functional object
with cross‐scalar properties made manifest in the object's form, performance, and physical properties —
or put simply, its digital matter.
Though the goal is not to produce buildings (program, circulation, site), projects will be evaluated on
their spatial and experiential potential and attention to digital craft. Students will be using Autodesk 3ds
Max for the generation and visualization of form and Processing for pattern, texture, and surface design.
The seminar will be taught through a series of in‐class tutorials, discussions, readings, and project based
critiques. Students will attempt to reconnect highly specialized trajectories of architectural discourse
into a single, cohesive design process.
\\\\
ATTENDANCE
Class meets on Wed from 9:00am‐12:00pm in West Mall Building, 5.112
Attendance is mandatory. Two (2) unexcused absences will result in a full letter grade drop in your final
grade for the course. Three (3) unexcused absences may result in administrative failure and being
dropped from the course. Absences are only excused with written documentation of a medical condition
or family emergency. If you plan on missing class for the observance of a religious holy day, please notify
the instructor at least 14 days prior per UT Austin policy. It is up to the student to complete work missed
due to excused absences within a reasonable time frame. If you show up late (5 minutes after the start
of class) 3 times, it will be counted as 1 unexcused absence.
\\\\
GRADING POLICY
Grading for the course is based on the full completion of all assignments. The percentage breakdown
listed below is only for reference. Please be aware that the final project is a synthesis of all the
assignments. If you do not complete or perform unsatisfactorily for any of the assignments, your grade
for future assignments will most likely be negatively impacted.
Attendance, Participation, and Presentation                                   20%
ASSIGNMENT 01 | Evolutionary Form Catalog                                     25%
ASSIGNMENT 02 | Procedural Membrane                                           25%
ASSIGNMENT 03 | Animation                                                     20%
ASSIGNMENT 04 | Final Submittal, project text                                 10%


A(‐)    Excellent
        Project surpasses expectations in terms of inventiveness, appropriateness, visual language,
        conceptual rigor, craft, and personal development. Student pursues concepts and techniques
        above and beyond what is discussed in class. Project is complete on all levels.
B(+,‐)  Above Average
        Project is thorough, well presented, diligently pursued, and successfully completed. Student
        pursues ideas and suggestions presented in class and puts in effort to resolve required
        projects. Project is complete on all levels and demonstrates potential for excellence.
C(+,‐)  Average
        Project meets the minimum requirements. Suggestions made in class and not pursued with
        dedication and rigor. Project is incomplete in one or more areas.
D(+)    Poor
        Project is incomplete. Basic grasp of skill is lacking, visual clarity or logic of presentation are not
        level‐appropriate. Student does not demonstrate the required competence and knowledge
        base.
F       Fail
        Project is unresolved. Minimum objectives are not met. Performance is not acceptable. Note
        that this grade will be assigned when you have excessive unexcused absences.
X       Excused Incomplete
        Can be given only for legitimate reasons of illness or family emergency. Simply not completing
        work on time is not an adequate cause for assigning this evaluation. It may only be used after
        consultation with the Associate Deans' offices and with an agreement as to a new completion
        date. Work must be completed before the second week of the next semester in which you are
        enrolling, according to the School of Architecture policy.
\\\\
DISABILITIES
Please notify your instructor of any adaptation you may require to accommodate a specific physical
need. You will be requested to provide documentation to the Dean of Student's Office, in order that the
most appropriate accommodations can be determined. Specialized services are available on campus
through the Services for Students with Disabilities, also found via the web at:
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/ or by phone at 512.471.6259

\\\\
SAFETY AND SECURITY
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires
exiting and assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building
you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the
first week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do
not re‐enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University
of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office. To find more information
regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures go to: www.utexas.edu/emergency


\\\\
COURSE REQUIREMENTS
There are no pre‐requisites for the course, though a knowledge of 3d modeling s recommended.
Students are required to have a laptop computer that is capable of running high performance 3d
software applications, including Autodesk 3ds Max and Processing. All programs should be 2017
versions of later. Students will also be required to purchase and install VRAY, a rendering plug‐in for 3ds
Max.
Weekly progress and participation in class pin‐ups and reviews is required, including completion of
assigned readings and participation in discussions. Each week, 1 or more students will be required to
present a review of the weeks required readings and the work/theory of the author.
The submission of high quality final renders (jpeg format), your final 3ds Max and Processing files, a 350
word project description, and your final animation on a USB Flash Drive or via a downloadable link is
mandatory. Failure to submit your work by the final day of class will result in a minimum full letter grade
drop in your final grade for the course.
Students will use multiple software programs, capitalizing on each program's best features in order to
unlock potential new territories of form‐making and methods of design. Though each program is
independently parametric, students will also work parametrically across platforms. The use of multiple
software packages will help the students overcome limitations imposed by current BIM programs, while
promoting a new integrated digital approach to the design of form, surface, and ornament.
Install all required software by the start of the second class.
Required Software Includes:
          Autodesk 3ds Max 2018 or later, 64‐bit | free student version
          Processing 3D | free download
