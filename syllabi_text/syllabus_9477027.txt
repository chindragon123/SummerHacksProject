GRADES
    1) Participation (50%): Students are expected to fully participate by engaging in discussions
       during each class. After each Wednesday class, there will be discussion questions posted to
       Canvas. You will have until 12 PM the next day to post your response. Late assignments will not
       be accepted. A few extra credit opportunities will be given throughout the class by your
       instructors and/or teaching assistants throughout the semester.
    2) Attendance (15%): Attendance will be taken at the end of each class. There will be no excused
       absences outside of medical emergencies. Each absence will deduct 1 point from the total
       attendance grade. More than three absences will lead to an automatic fail.
    3) Reflection Paper (25%): By the end of the course, students are expected to turn in a 1-page, no
       more or less, double spaced reflection paper. Some questions to consider are:
           • What did you learn from the speaker series? How does this apply to your life?
           • In what ways has your thinking changed or been influenced by the speaker series?
           • Why do you believe it’s important for first-years to hear from multiple speakers?


4) End of Semester Evaluation (10%): Students are expected to complete and submit an end of
   semester evaluation for the course.
