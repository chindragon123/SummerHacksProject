Course Description
This course examines a variety of Japanese popular manga and anime, focusing mainly on those
works Japan has exported since becoming an economic superpower in the 1980s. We will
explore utopian/dystopian expression in Japanese sci-fi narratives, examine the ways that the
Japanese entertainment industry has responded to changing notions of gender, and chart the
evolution of traditional genre categories as they accommodate new hybridic representations of
the posthuman body. We will also consider the significance of global fandom with the rise of
the transnational otaku, and its relevance to Japan’s exercise of soft power.
Required Texts
Anime: A Critical Introduction, Denison, Rayna (2015)
ISBN: 978-1847884794
Anime From Akira to Howl's Moving Castle: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation,
Napier, Susan, (2005) ISBN: 978-1403970527
Course Objectives:
    ● Students will read, view, analyze, interpret, discuss and write critically about
         contemporary Japanese popular media.
    ● Students will learn to perform close textual analysis, and demonstrate their findings
         through responses to test and discussion questions.
    ● Students will demonstrate their ability to visually decode complex media messages with
         culturally specific meanings through online discussions and written tests.
    ● Students will construct a persuasive argument on behalf of a particular example of
         Japanese popular culture, and write a brief paper supporting their views.
Course Work:
Students will be expected to view the films listed in the schedule during the week in which they
are listed. For your convenience, I will upload the two films to Canvas during the week that we
discuss them. In addition, there are readings listed in the schedule, which you should read
during the week when they will be covered. Many of the readings will come from the required
textbooks (indicated by the author’s name), but I have made additional readings available in each
Module. I will upload 2 lectures each week to Canvas (I will try to upload these on Monday and
Wednesday afternoons). The lectures will consist of PowerPoint slide shows with images, audio
and occasional links to videos.
Course Work continued:
                                                 1


There will also be discussion questions each week that will encourage reflection on the films,
readings and lectures. For full credit, each student will write a one-paragraph response to one of
the questions, include a quote from the readings, and write a reply to another student's post. In
addition, there will be a test at the end of each unit. The test questions will be drawn from
material we have reviewed in class and will be given in multiple formats (T/F, multiple choice,
short IDs, Definitions, etc.). Students will also write a short paper (500-700 words) arguing for
the inclusion of an anime of their choosing that does not currently appear on the syllabus.

Global Cultures Flag
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States, so a substantial portion of your
grade will come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and history and culture of
Japan.
