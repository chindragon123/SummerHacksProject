Description
This upper-division, honors, research seminar focuses on the life, writings, and influence of Niccolò
Machiavelli (1469-1527), one of the most controversial writers in the Western canon. How did this
man—who was in his own eyes a poet—become a byword for ‘might makes right’ power politics?
In what sense was he at once o philosopher, a politician, a classicist, a military strategist, an ethicist,
and a no-account “ribald” (as his contemporary enemies called him)? How did his reputation get
reduced to the clichéd term “machiavellian”? what was his effect on early modern Europe and its
colonies, on the global emergence of the nation-state, on the phenomena of constitutional
democracy and fascism, on the histories of ethics, gender, and religion? And what can his writings
teach us about the Renaissance and about ourselves?
To answer these questions (and many others), we’ll read and discuss as much of his work as we can
manage. We’ll write in different formats—as Machiavelli himself did—to explore the challenges of
his legacy. You’ll also have the opportunity to learn about efforts to understand and apply his ideas,
from the sixteenth century to the twenty-first. In-class writing and small group projects will
prepare you to choose a topic for individual research. As a student-historian, you’ll conclude the
semester with a research project, which might take the form of an academic paper, a public history
poster, a digital platform, or another sort of project worked out with your professor.
By the end of the course, you will understand
         * basic historical methods for reading primary sources.
         * a range of scholarly disagreements about fundamental points of interpretation.
         * the critical importance of arguing from evidence.
         * and be able to articulate the four key stages of a history research project: define a
         question; select evidence; manage and analyze evidence; and present a clear and persuasive
         argument.
His 350L courses are capstones in the History Department: expect at least 30% of your final grade
to come from writing assignments, and 30% from research assignments.
Seminars are not lecture courses. It is imperative that you prepare the reading carefully and
come to class ready for conversation about the reading. Any writing we do in class is aimed at
supporting that conversation. If you cannot contribute regularly, thoughtfully, and collegially to
our conversation, you cannot get an “A” in this course. Because our conversation is so important,
missing class is especially serious: I expect you to be on time for every class meeting.
                                                                                                              1


There are no prerequisites for this course, but His 343g “Italian Renaissance” and other medieval
or early modern history, art, philosophy, and literature classes are strongly recommended.
This course carries three flags
1.) Independent Inquiry.
Independent Inquiry Flag courses engage you in the process of inquiry, providing opportunities for
investigation of questions, problems, and projects related to your major and your life. A substantial
portion of your grade will come from information literacy assignments, independent investigation,
and class presentation of your work.
2.) Writing.
Writing Flag courses give you experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this history
class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects,
and receive helpful feedback from your peers and your instructor. You will revise one or more
assignments, and you will read and discuss your peers’ work. You should expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from your written work.
3.) Ethics.
Ethics Flag courses aim to equip you with skills that are necessary for making ethical decisions in
your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to
come from assignments involving ethical issues and the process of applying ethical reasoning to
real-life historical situations.

Honor Code. The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community. Plagiarism (the unacknowledged use of others’ words or ideas) is dishonest, unfair, and
disrespectful, as well as being grounds for failure in the course. See www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs
Classroom Expectations. I use the CANVAS information management system to record grades,
post readings, and make announcements. It is your responsibility to keep your email address up-to-
date with the University so that Canvas notifications reach you on time.
Every student has the right to learn in a supportive environment. During class, restrict your
electronic devices to course materials only. Failure to comply with this UT Austin policy will hurt
your final grade
Many of you will be doing the course reading online. We will have some DH assignments, and will
use the CANVAS online system for submitting assignments and communicating in groups. Clearly
laptops and other devices will be part of our course. Aside from that, the class will decide the role of
devices in our day to day work.
Religious Holidays. By UT Austin policy, absences for religious holy days require that you notify
me at least fourteen days beforehand. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment,
or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete
the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
