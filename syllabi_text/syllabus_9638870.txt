Course Syllabus RTF w329c
Summer 2019
note: any part of this syllabus or the course structure itself, including how grades are tabulated
or awarded may change at any time
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Animation, Visual Effects, Digital Painting and CGI are used to digital content for a variety of
formats including film, animation and video games. Through hands-on CREATIVE
ASSIGNMENTS, you will learn the TOOLS and TECHNIQUES of Digital Media Production.
You will apply these techniques to complete a variety of tasks in the PIPELINE of digital
production: preproduction, performance, compositing, CG and interactive design. In the end,
you must choose: Will you become a generalist across all digital media production or will you
SPECIALIZE in one discipline? Perhaps you will you define a new role in digital media
production.

Online Class Format:
Teaching and learning in this online course is different from from many face to face courses.
It is iterative, it is self paced, it is non-linear.
This course is a collection of CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS -- which comprise the bulk of the
course, SPEED CHALLENGES -- which reward you for maintaining a steady pace, and EXTRA
CREDIT -- which is awarded for exceptional work, attending special events or completing other
miscellaneous tasks.
You may complete the CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS in any order you wish, though I do ask that
you complete the DMP Entrance Exam before you begin (and yes, this Exam does count as one
of your CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS).


You may submit (and resubmit) a CREATIVE ASSIGNMENT as many times as you wish until
you are satisfied with your grade. Made a mistake? Fix it and resubmit--no penalty.
You may complete the CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS at your own pace. There is only one
required deadline in this course: August 16, 11:59 pm. After this date/time, I will not accept
submissions (or revisions).
Communication:
If you wish, there need be very little communication between us.
You can simply submit your assignments, we review (and grade) them.
It may be that you would like to have a more substantial conversation about your work. We
welcome this engagement.
In order to streamline the process of communication, here are some rules:
All written interactions between us will happen through CANVAS.
If you have a question or comment about a particular CREATIVE ASSIGNMENT, please
communicate in the comment section of that assignment
example: "Is it okay to use Adobe Illustrator for this particular assignment?"
Questions about HOW the course operates should be made via email to me through the Canvas
Inbox System.
example: "When are your office hours?"
If you would like to discuss something in person, please make an appointment during office
hours. Make an Appointment via this link. (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
The TAs and I rotate grading projects and we all have access to all communication, so it may be
you are engaged with several people in a thread.
Responses via the CANVAS INBOX can take up to one week.
Responses to SUBMISSION COMMENTS can take up to one week.
Office Hours: I will be available both simultaneously online and in-person every week Thursday
evenings. Time TBA.


Office Location: I will hold office hours in a computer lab with all the software and equipment
you need. Currently, I have CMB 4.114 reserved, but this may change.
If you would like lock in a specific time to talk, you may Make an Appointment via this link.Links
to an external site.
If you are remote, you can use this link to join me via google hangout (appointment only).

OR, you can just come in to the lab and I will be available to help you through any roadblocks
you might encounter.
Required Software: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Animate, Adobe After Effects, Maya, Adobe
Media Encoder
Optional and Alternative Software: Unity3d, Unreal Editor, Adobe Character Animator
This is an online course.
Your task is to complete 15 CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS and a selection of CHALLENGES
before the end of the semester.
CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS are projects you create using digital media tools and techniques.
Every assignment is worth 6 points--they are all equally weighted. You should complete 15
CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS by the end of the course.
scoring: 15 CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS X 6 points each = 90 points = 90% of your grade. (You
can never make more than 90 points for doing the CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS)
CHALLENGES and EXTRA CREDIT are awarded for speed, initiative, and exceptional quality
of work. CHALLENGES are not all equally scored.
This CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS are divided into 3 UNITS. Units do not represent a section of
time, but organize similar topics/assignments into a weighted category within the gradebook.
TOOLS UNIT :


The TOOLS UNIT is focused on software.

EXTRA CREDIT
Extra Credit assignments may be also be added as opportunity arises during the semester.
EXTRA CREDIT: Submit a Tutorial LINK
EXTRA CREDIT: Take a SELFIE with Ben
EXTRA CREDIT: Appear in one of your projects.
EXTRA CREDIT: Your work FEATURED in the DMP showcase
You do not have to complete every assignment offered in the course, but you need to complete
at least 5 assignments from each UNIT in order to make an 90%(A-). There are MANY
assignments in the SPECIALIZATION UNIT, so you can choose a focus or generalize, or put
some different ideas together.
Course Presentation
The content for each ASSIGNMENT is presented in a few ways:
VIDEOS. These videos are meant to be an introduction to some of the topics in the course.


ONLINE RESOURCES. This is where you will find links to further information and tutorials. All
the SKILLS can be learned online. If you find a tutorial or useful link I have not included, you
may submit it as a CHALLENGE.
STUDENT EXAMPLES. Want to know what the expectations are for your work? Check the
student examples from your peers. Exceptional student work from current and previous
semesters is on display. If there is nothing in that section yet, you can set the bar in terms of
quality.
COURSE EVALUATION:
When the course begins, I will give you a default grade of ZERO for every single assignment.
Do not panic. This is for gradebook purposes.
Your goal (as always) is to go from 0 to 100 points. 100 points = 100 percent = A
CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS are worth 6 points each. This the the bulk of the course: projects
which are intended to build your portfolio.
CHALLENGES have different point values depending on their difficulty.
CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS = 90 points maximum
The CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS are organized into 3 UNITS:
SOFTWARE UNIT
PIPELINE UNIT
SPECIALIZATION UNIT
Complete 5 ASSIGNMENTS from each UNIT for a total of 15 CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS.
15 CREATIVE ASSIGNMENTS x 6 points each = 90 points
CHALLENGES = no maximum
CHALLENGES will allow you to fill in the final 10 points and move your grade from a 90 to a
100. The total available points under the CHALLENGES section is more than 10, though.
Clever use of CHALLENGES can allow you to game this course. Some challenges can be
repeated. Some are one-time events. Some are timed. New CHALLENGES may be added as
the semester progresses.

 Assignment Evaluation


Each CREATIVE ASSIGNMENT is worth 6 points
RUBRICS can help guide you through each assignment
I have quantified my expectations in the RUBRIC.
Have a question about the assignment or the rubric? Please pose that question in the
comments section of that particular assignment. That way, CANVAS will direct me and the
graders to the appropriate assignment.
Checking your grade:
Everything in this class goes through Canvas, the Grades section will be updated regularly.

Fair Use:
You may use your own photos, videos, audio etc for any of the assignments. I welcome it.
You may ALSO use any images, videos, audio from other sources including the internet. You
are not limited to public domain or creative commons licensed footage. You may use anything
provided you transform it.
Ask yourself this question:
 Is the use you want to make of another's work transformative -- that is, does it add value to and
repurpose the work for a new audience -- and is the amount of material you want to use
appropriate to achieve your transformative purpose?
If you simply turn in someone else's video, it is not transformative (and is also plagiarism). But if
you download a video and rotoscope or animate over it, it IS transformative. Every assignment
in this course requires that you add something.
Fair Use can seem complex, but in the context of this course, it is pretty clear: you CAN use
other people work in your own provided you transform it.

RTF Safety Policy
Special safety precautions for your crew, actors and others in the area are required if you are
undertaking any hazardous activities while filming, including but not limited to ANY driving or
horseback/livestock shots, shooting in or around water or heights, or if you are using stunts,
flames, pyrotechnics, squibs or simulated weapons. Please note that unlicensed handguns and
other real weapons are never permitted in RTF studios or on location shoots. In addition, you
must follow all federal, state and local laws and the rules of any venue or location at which you
are filming regarding hazardous activities, including University of Texas at Austin rules if filming
is done on campus.
Student filmmakers must submit a detailed safety plan to their course instructor and the RTF
Technical Facilities Manager if a script or project involves driving or horseback/livestock shots,
shooting in or around water or heights, stunts, flames, pyrotechnics, squibs, weapons or any
other hazardous activities (this requirement applies to all shoots, including documentary
projects, but please see the special guidelines for documentary driving shots below). It is the
responsibility of the student to hire experts in the field and budget at least $600/day for expert
consultation and on-set supervision if, in the judgment of the class instructor and the Technical
Facilities Manager, such expert consultation or supervision is necessary. In addition, any
utilization of pyrotechnics on the University of Texas at Austin campus requires prior review and
approval through the Fire Prevention Services office by the University Fire Marshal or their
designee.
Students should understand that driving while filming will be permitted only in strictly limited
circumstances, such as on a private road or drive. In most circumstances, students who wish to
undertake driving shots will be required to arrange for a police escort and a city permit.
Monitors inside the vehicle will NOT be allowed while filming in a vehicle. Filming from the back
of trucks is not considered safe and is not permitted under any circumstances.
Documentary filming of an interview while the interview subject is driving is only permitted if the
cameraperson is secured in a seat belt and is not directing the driver of the car in any way,
besides engaging in a conversation in which the driver/interviewee has been informed not to
look at the camera or the interviewer at all during the interview. In addition, any filming from a
vehicle, for drive-by B-roll, must be done by a cameraperson secured in a seat belt, where the
driver is not being directed in any way by the director, so that they are driving as they normally
would. As noted above, any documentary student planning on filming in any vehicle must
submit a safety plan to their course instructor and the RTF Technical Facilities Manager.
Students who fail to comply with this policy will receive a failing grade in this class and will be
barred from future access to RTF production and post-production equipment and facilities


If Police, Fire, or EMS are called to your shoot, or any injuries on your shoot require medical
attention, this must be reported to your instructor and the Assistant Director of Production
Services, (Keefe Boerner Keefe.Boerner@austin.utexas.edu), within 24 hours of the incident.
There is a form in checkout and on the RTF website that must be filled out and returned within
three business days.
Policy on Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University,
policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, please visit the
Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct
