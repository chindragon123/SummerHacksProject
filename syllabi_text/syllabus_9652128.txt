Geography 301K - Weather and Climate (Unique # 81390)
Second Summer Semester 2019
Use of Class Materials
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments are
copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying and selling of the class materials is a violation of federal law
and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student. Additionally, the sharing of class materials
without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code
and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action. This includes, among other
things, uploading any and all class materials (including class notes) to web sites for the purpose of selling and/or
sharing those materials with other current or future students.
“Non Technology” Classroom (for “in person” class)
I prohibit the use of laptop computers and smart phones (including texting) during class time unless specified by
the instructor and/or TA. This is a “zero tolerance” policy - we will be monitoring the classroom and will stop
lecture and ask anyone using a device to turn it off. My expectation is that you are here to listen to and take part in
lecture. Accordingly, your class notes must be taken with paper and pen.

CLASS OBJECTIVES:
Our study of weather and climate is intended for Geography / Environment majors and all others interested in a broad brush examination
of the atmospheric and climatic sciences. This study will be introductory in nature with only a very basic use of mathematics. We will start
with a study of meteorology. From this foundation, we will go into the different aspects of the atmosphere and then, later, into
climatological matters and discuss the various climatic regimes including that of Texas and the local area.
ATTENDANCE:
While this is probably not going to be the hardest course you've ever taken (or will take) in your college career, it is intensive. This is due,
primarily, to the amount of material to be covered during the semester. It is, therefore, my philosophy that your success in this course will
vary directly with your class attendance. Be aware of the fact that attendance will be taken on a regular basis, through the SquareCap
classroom management application (which will be necessary for you to purchase); we will be using this application through your smart
phone web browser. This attendance information will be used in the computation of your final class grade. Excessive absences will work
against you while perfect attendance can help you to the next highest letter grade in borderline situations at the end of the semester.
Regarding our class time, promptness is expected; you should make every effort to be in the classroom or on line at the times indicated.
Late arrivals are an interruption to the class material being presented and are unfair to your fellow students that have made the effort to
be on time.
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS / POLICY ON SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY:
In this class, there is zero tolerance for students who violate university rules on scholastic dishonesty with all suspected cases turned
over to the University’s Dean of Students office. Penalties for scholastic include the possibility of failure of course and dismissal from the
University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, fellow students and the integrity of the University, policies
on scholastic dishonesty will be STRICTLY ENFORCED in this class.
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA):
The University of Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more
information, contact the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259, 471-6441
TTY, 866-329-3986 video phone.
If you have documentation regarding accommodations from the Dean of Students office, you must meet with me, in person and during
office hours, as early as possible in the semester to discuss exact accommodations. When you come to this meeting, you will be
required to provide written documentation from the Services for Students with Disabilities. Accommodations are NOT effective until
you meet with me in office hours with your paperwork. No exceptions.
TEXTBOOK MATERIAL:
We will utilize the following textbook during the semester:
Essentials of Meteorology (8th Edition) - C. Donald Ahrens - Required (No other publisher material needed, so new or used OK)
Goode's World Atlas (23rd Edition) - Recommended
These books are available at the University Coop and other campus bookstores as well through on-line textbook web sites.
Please shop around for the best price.


GRADING PROCEDURE:
Your final grade will be determined by your numerical performance on the examinations as noted:
Examination #1                                   200 points
Examination #2                                   200 points
Examination #3                                   200 points
Place Name Examination                            50 points
Examination #4                                   200 points
Attendance Quizzes/Exercises                      50 points
Final Cumulative Exam                            300 points
Only three of the regular examination scores will count; the lowest of the four grades will be dropped (see MAKE-UP EXAMINATIONS).
All numerical scores will be added together to arrive at a possible 1000 points at the end of the semester, where, when utilizing the UT
“Plus” / “Minus” Final Grade Grading System and applying it to our 1000 point grading s ystem...
900-933 = A- (GPA earned = 3.67), 934-1000 = A (GPA earned = 4.00)
800-833 = B- (GPA earned = 2.67), 834-866 = B (GPA earned = 3.00), 867-899 = B+ (GPA earned = 3.33)
700-733 = C- (GPA earned = 1.67), 734-766 = C (GPA earned = 2.00), 767-799 = C+ (GPA earned = 2.33)
600-633 = D- (GPA earned = 0.67), 634-666 = D (GPA earned = 1.00), 767-799 = D+ (GPA earned = 1.33)
0-599 = F (GPA earned = 0.00)
All 200 point exams in this class are given outside of our class time during the mid and late afternoon hours (see the class material time
line on the fourth page of this syllabus for the four exact dates).
All examinations will be objective (multiple choice). Exams will not be returned to you although your exam key (showing you the number
of the question you missed) will be available through Canvas after each exam; If you want to see an exam or go over your answers, you
must bring a paper copy of your exam key or a piece pf paper indicating the questions you missed during office hours. Any questions
regarding exams will be brought forth within the specified number of days after the exam date otherwise the grade is considered final.
MAKE-UP EXAMINATIONS:
There will be NO make-up of the four regular examinations under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. It's precisely for the reasons of sickness and
other unplanned absences as well as for the occasional "bad" test day that I allow the lowest of your regular four examination scores to
be dropped. Also, please note that you are required to take the final exam on the date and time as specified by the University (no
excused absences).
EXAMINATION DAYS:
In order to ensure honesty in the classroom (and given the class size for this particular class and section), please note that I have set
guidelines in reference to examination days:
# Beginning with the handout of the examinations, I expect silence
# All material that you bring with you on examination day will be placed on the floor under your seat
# No headwear (caps, hats, hoodies) will be worn while in our classroom on examination days
# Once the examination is distributed, there will be no leaving the classroom for any reason.
CLASSROOM / CAMPUS EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS:
The status of University of Texas campus activities in times of emergency (i.e., severe/inclement
weather) along with some important procedures in case of emergencies on our campus as well as in our classrooms can always be
found on the University of Texas Emergency Web Page.
The University of Texas maintains Emergency Action Plans that addresses emergencies that could potentially affect the our community.
You can reference the various plans here.
Our UT Siren System is used in times of emergencies when it is necessary for you to "shelter in place" in campus buildings (remain in or
go to the nearest building on campus when the siren is activated and remain there until the "all clear" is given). The UT Siren System, as
part of policy, is tested monthly on the first Wednesday of every month between 11:50 am and 12:00 noon. Please don't take the siren
system tests for granted; be ready to take action if the siren system is activated!
We will discuss, during the first class day of the session, our emergency plan for our specific classroom in case of fire, severe/inclement
weather and other different situations. Please take this discussion seriously and ask any questions that you may have!!
UT POLICY ON EMAIL NOTIFICATION
Instructor to student email is a recognized and accepted form of official communication here at the University of Texas.
It is critically important that (1) you make sure to have your current and most frequently checked email address on file in UT Direct and
(2) you check it on a daily basis. I will send class email frequently during the semester and you'll be given updates and change notices in
references to lectures as well as exams.
