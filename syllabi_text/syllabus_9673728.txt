Course description:
Learning genetics is usually very time-consuming! Genetics has earned a reputation as a stumbling
block to some students at universities all over the world. There are several reasons for this. One of
the most important reasons is that doing well in a Genetics class requires very different skills than
doing well in an anatomy class or a microbiology class. Analytical thinking is the most important
skill necessary for understanding genetics. Memorization skills will help you, but you will have to really
understand the material to do well in Genetics class. Best way to improve your analytical skill is to
practice as many problems as possible. That’s why I encourage you to work on problems (before class/
in-class quizzes, homeworks and etc.).
Required Course Materials:
Textbooks with Connect Access:
From Genes to Genomes (Hartwell et al., 6th edition)
eBook with ConnectPLUS is recommended
You are welcome to purchase the ConnectPLUS, but I decided not to integrate into this class. This will be
helpful if you want to practice additional questions for each chapter.
Additional materials:
I will provide either URL link for the on-line material (I might use some on-line textbooks, which are
free of charge; and some other web resources) or pdf files for any additional material that I will
cover in the class.
Lectures and readings:
Lecture handouts will be posted on Canvas by 6pm the evening prior to the corresponding lecture.
Lecture handouts are drafts until given, and perhaps a little afterwards (they can be revised at any

time). Each week (lectures), you will be given on corresponding chapters in the textbook (see
schedule). I will try to stay within the textbook. But from time to time, I will use material from other
sources. Additional readings from the literature or available on the internet may be assigned and
will be made available through Canvas.
Correspondence: All announcements/scores/answers/ will be made available through Canvas. So
check the site often. I will also use group email through Canvas. So please make sure that your
official University email address is an address at which you actually read mail.
UT Instapoll: Attendance and class participation will be determined using UT Instapoll. UT Instapoll
is a web-based, in-class learning system that you may use through your phone, tablet, or computer.
UT Instapoll is free for UT students and can be accessed through canvas.
Canvas website- Grades will be posted on Canvas.                                    The URL for Canvas is
http://canvas.utexas.edu/
Exams and grading:
Exams: There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. The midterm exam will primarily test the
material covered since the start of the class. The final exam will emphasize the material since the
midterm, but will also include topics from earlier in the semester. Each exam will have a maximum
score of 100 points. The lowest of the two exam scores will be dropped. Thus, exam scores will count
up to 200 points.
There will be no makeup exams. If an exam is missed, it is the one that will be dropped. It is your
responsibility to arrive at exams on time. Students who arrive late will not be given additional time,
and anyone arriving after other students have finished and left the classroom will have to drop that
exam.
Homeworks: There will be four homeworks (25 points each one). Hopeworks will be uploaded on
Canvas with due dates. Each homework should be given to teaching assistant before the class starts
on the due date. Homeworks are for completion only. Keys will be posted on Canvas.
Class participation: Questions answered using UT Instapoll by phone, tablet, or computer during
each lecture will be worth a total of 50 points toward your final grade.
Quizzes: Two quizzes, each worth 20 points, will be given throughout the semester. The quizzes will
assess knowledge of the assigned reading material and material covered in class. The lowest quiz grade
will be automatically dropped, for a total of 20 points. No makeup quizzes will be given and any
missed quizzes will count toward the drop limit.
Discussion sections: Attendance at discussion section is required to help you keep up with material
that we cover during class and in your reading. The teaching assistant will review material covered in
class and answer your questions. A total of 30 points can be earned for quizzes or problems assigned
during discussion section.

  Following grade scales are “guaranteed”: Therefore, it is possible that all of you get “A” if
  you do well.

  Cut-offs can be lower (but will not be higher) depending on overall performance of the class.
Religious holy days
Should you miss class on a holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the work within a
reasonable time after the absence. Note that it is the policy of The University of Texas at Austin that
a student must notify each instructor at least fourteen days prior to any classes scheduled on the dates
he or she will be absent to observe a religious holy day.
Academic dishonesty
Cheating will not be tolerated, and will result at minimum in the recommendation that a grade of F be
assigned for the course. Additional information on the definition of academic dishonesty, including
plagiarism, can be found at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Students with disabilities
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of
Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259,
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/
Student Emergency Services, in the Office of the Dean of Students, works with campus and
community organizations to provide a number of services to assist students, and in some cases their
families and friends, during an emergency or crisis situation. Your instructors may receive notification
that you require accommodation, but your personal information will not be shared.
