 COURSE OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES
   Over the course of its history, advertising has solidified itself globally as a major economic and cultural
   force. This course is designed to familiarize you with advertising’s rise to its position of prominence. Our
   focus will be on understanding advertising’s development as a communication tool, a cultural and
   economic phenomenon, and as a force that both constructs and reflects society.
   This course has three main objectives. Using a historical frame of reference, we will explore:
   1.  What advertising can do and what advertising cannot do
   2.  How advertising is a reflection of and a form of culture
   3.  To what degree advertising is a pervasive form of communication
   4.  What lessons can we learn from the past to prepare the future
   I have structured the course chronologically with an emphasis on specific societal themes, such as
   gender or political engagement, as well as specific advertising appeals, such as humor, fear,
   endorsement, or sex, as they pertain to particular points in the evolution of advertising. While you will
   learn about the important people and dates that make up advertising’s history, my aim is for you to
   understand these facts against the more interesting and more important backdrop of how advertising is
   both a product and an agent of cultural change.

   The lectures are designed to supplement the material you’ve read in the book. I won’t spend the lecture
   time going over the whole material, but instead will use it as an opportunity to go into more detail about
   issues and topics. Consider the class a chance to share your thoughts and opinions on the issues. We
   will learn from others. Every class day, I will upload a brief guide that outlines what we will be
   covering and provide you with space to fill in the details.
 YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
   1. Attend class regularly and behave respectfully to other students and to your instructors.
   2. Speak up: If you have questions or need something explaining, raise your hand or say “question!”
   3. Get to know your classmates: Introduce yourself to some students sitting near you. There
       will be many times during the semester when you’ll be working with them on in- class
       exercises. Get to know some students now and the class will feel a whole lot smaller.
   4. Be prepared: Do the readings before class and be ready to discuss them in class.
   5. Effectively use the lecture guides: I will not be making my entire lecture slides available, but
       a brief guide for each lecture that outlines what we will be covering that day will be provided.
       You are responsible for printing these out or download on your electronic devices. I will not
       bring printouts of these to class.
   6. You MUST check e-mail/Canvas regularly. I will use Canvas to post announcements, grades,
       updates (including any changes to the syllabus), additional required readings, and homework
       assignments. Thus, you should check e-mail/Canvas on a regular basis. Failure to do so is not an
       acceptable excuse for missing an important announcement, assignment or update. * ITS Help Desk
       at 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
   7. Please let me know immediately if you have any problem that is preventing you from performing
       satisfactorily in this class.
  A NOTE ON COMPUTER AND CELL PHONE USE:
  I understand that many students prefer to take notes directly on their laptops, so I will allow the use
  of computers in class. However, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of students who
  use the Internet for non-class purposes during class time. The same is true of cell phones and texting.
  These activities are strictly forbidden, and the following details a policy to prevent them:
   • All electronic devices must be turned OFF and put away. Laptops are the only exception.
       Turn off your cell phone, PDA, pager.
   • Any student caught surfing the Internet, texting, checking e-mail etc. for non-class purposes will
       be asked to leave immediately. If the behavior persists, points will be deducted from the
       student’s final course grade each subsequent time this occurs.
  EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY:
  My approach to teaching is grounded in the belief that learning takes place by pushing yourself
  beyond your comfort zone and by engaging with the material.
       1. The more willing you are to make mistakes and challenge what you think you know, the
           more likely you are to learn.
       2. The more willing you are to engage with the learning material and participate in class
           activities and discussions, the more likely you are to learn.
  Adopting these two perspectives will not only help you in this class, but also in the other classes you
  take at the University of Texas and in your professional lives.

 ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING
  1. Bio
      a. You will be required to update your bio on Canvas. Share your stories with us!
      b. Details of the assignment will be posted in a separate document. This is credit/no credit.
  2. Attendance and Participation
      a. Attendance is required. I will be taking attendance randomly throughout the semester. You
          are allowed to miss two (2) attendance checks without it affecting your grade.
      b. There are no excused absences.
      c. There will be many non-graded in-class exercises. Some will be carried out individually;
          some will be structured as small group exercises. Although not graded, you will get credit
          for doing them and each one will count toward your participation grade.
      d. The best way to maximize your attendance grade is to come to class.
      e. You will be required to participate in two online research studies.
  3. Discussion
      a. You will be expected to participate in meaningful, relevant and targeted discussions in your
          small discussion group. Details of the assignment will be posted separately.
      b. As part of your discussion grade you will be required to post:
          • One AD CRITIQUE. This post is a substantial discussion of a contemporary ad that you
              have found. You will be assigned a date on which to upload your post.
          • Four RESPONSE COMMENTS. For the four weeks that you are not responsible for
              posting the Ad Critique, you are expected to post a thoughtful and meaningful reply to the
              Ad Critique uploaded by your colleague.
  4. Three Tests
      a. Each test will consist of 50 multiple choice questions worth 1/2 point each.
      b. There are four tests (including the final exam) but your lowest test score will be dropped.
      c. If you show up late, you will not be allowed to take the test and it will count as your drop.
  5. Two In-class Assignments
      a. Each assignment will be a long-form answer to a prompt that asks you to apply the information
          you’ve learned so far. For example, you may be asked to compare and contrast three ads. Or
          you might be given a scenario and asked how you would respond as an advertiser.
      b. There are three assignments, but your lowest assignment score will be dropped.
      c. If you show up late, you will not be allowed to take the assignment and it will count as your drop.

 Important Note
   Because your lowest test and assignment scores are dropped, there will be no make-up tests or
   opportunities to re-do (or hand in late) the tests or assignments.
   There are no excused “absences” or missed assignments/tests. I do not differentiate between excused and
   unexcused absences or justified and unjustified reasons for not meeting deadlines. It’s not my place to
   decide which excuses are more legitimate or more worthy than others.
   Assignment 3 and the Final Exam (test #4) are essentially optional, since only two assignment scores
   and three test scores will be counted toward your final grade. If you are satisfied with the scores on your
   first two assignments and first three tests, then you need not take Assignment 3 or the Final Exam.
   However, if you miss one of the tests or assignments during the semester, then you must take the
   optional assignment or exam. Note that the Final Exam is cumulative and covers the whole semester.
   The regular tests are not cumulative.
 Some Words on Grading
   • I will NOT be rounding up percentage grades or points. So if you earn an 89.6% that
        translates into a B+ and will not be rounded up to 90% (an A-).
   • Note that your grade on Canvas is most likely NOT accurate, for various reasons. First, Canvas
        often rounds up grades; I do not. Second, it counts everything, even assignments that will be
        dropped. To calculate your final grade, add up your points earned so far.
   • Any questions or concerns about a grade must be presented in writing (i.e. via email) within three
        (3) days after the grade is announced or posted. I will not discuss grades after that.
   • When we grade your work, you start with zero points. You earn points based on the quality of the
        work and the accuracy, appropriateness and detail of your answers. You do not start with 100
        points and then lose them based on mistakes you might make. Your final points represent the total
        points earned for that assignment, not the number of points “taken away” for errors or omissions.
 Extra Credit
   You will have an opportunity to earn extra credit by taking part in two additional online research
   studies. Participation in each study will earn you 0.4 points (about 0.25%) added to your final grade.
   The studies can be found at https://advertising.utexas.edu/research/pool.

 ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
  University of Texas Honor Code: The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning,
  discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the
  university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
  toward peers and community.
  Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code. Any work
  submitted by a student in this course for academic credit must be the student's own work. I encourage
  you to collaborate with your fellow students by studying together and discussing information and
  concepts covered in lecture, but all tests, quizzes and assignments must be done independently.
  Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave
  material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment.
  Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University
  disciplinary action.
  During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the
  examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any
  collaborative behavior during the examinations will result in failure of the exam, and may lead to
  failure of the course and University disciplinary action.
 OTHER UNIVERSITY NOTICES AND POLICIES
  1. Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence to Students
  All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student notification policy. It
  is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or her e-mail
  address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current
  with University-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-
  critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The
  complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your e- mail address are available at:
  http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html.
  2. Documented Disability Statement
  Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact
  Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video
  phone). Faculty are not required to provide accommodations without an official accommodation letter
  from SSD.
       ▪ Please notify me as quickly as possible if the material being presented in class is not accessible
            (e.g., instructional videos need captioning, course packets are not readable for proper
            alternative text conversion, etc.).
       ▪ Contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video
            phone) or reference SSD’s website for more disability-related information:
            http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/for_cstudents.php
  3. Religious Holy Days
  By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the
  date of observance of a religious holy day.

  4. Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
  If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice
  Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided
  through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health
  Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police
  Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
  5. Q drop Policy
  The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six
  (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:
           “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit
           an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a
           transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student shows
           good cause for dropping more than that number.”
  6. Emergency Evacuation Policy
  Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a
  fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding
  evacuation:
           ▪ Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that
               the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
           ▪ If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
           ▪ In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors. Do not re-
  enter a building unless the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire
  Prevention Services office gives you instructions to do so.
  7. Counseling and Mental Health Services
  Taking care of your general well-being is an important step in being a successful student. If stress, test
  anxiety, racing thoughts, feeling unmotivated or anything else is getting in your way, there are options
  available for support.
