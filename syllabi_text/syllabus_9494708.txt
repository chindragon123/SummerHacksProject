Managing the Design Project
Project Management for the Design Professional
Professor: Dr. Richard W. Jennings, FAIA
Time:         Thursday, 2:00-5:00 pm
Room:         SUT 2.110
Course Description
The project is the basic defining element of architectural, engineering, interiors, and planning practice. It
is through the process of managing and leading projects that design concepts are translated into reality.
This course addresses the management and leadership of design projects, including buildings, interiors,
planning, and other types of professional services projects.
Valuable to students of architecture, architectural engineering, interior design, landscape architecture,
civil, structural, mechanical and electrical building engineering, planning, and students in real estate and
business who want to learn about the process of managing and delivering projects.
This course provides a solid introduction to project management, including: project start up; scoping,
budgeting, and scheduling; financial management and control of projects; owner and client
relationships; establishing and negotiating professional fees; project revenue recognition, earned value
management, and percent complete determination; overview of both traditional and newer alternate
project delivery approaches, including traditional design-bid-build, design-build, bridging, fast-track, and
Integrated Project Delivery (IPD); introduction to Gantt charts, critical path scheduling and other
scheduling techniques; team building; coalescing owner-designer-contractor relationships; professional
services delivery; project risks and mitigation; life cycle costing analysis; project close-out,
commissioning, post-occupancy services; and other project management topics.
The course is comprised of lectures, written assignments, readings, real-world cases, role-playing
exercises based on real-world situations, and expert guest speakers from the design, construction and
real estate fields. This course complements other practice-related courses.
Assignments
There are Assigned readings and short written assignments. In addition, in lieu of examinations there is a
5-page Midterm and 5-7-page Final Paper, double spaced preferred, on the student’s choice of relevant
topics, such as the project management process, client relationship management, advantages and
disadvantages of various design service delivery methods, team building, integrated project delivery,
project communications, or design team leadership.
Evaluation
Student evaluations will be based on class attendance, preparation and participation (20%), written
assignments (25%), the midterm paper (25%), and the final paper (30%).

Late work
Late work will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
Absences
Class attendance is important and is part of the course grade. Excused absences are for religious
holidays, illnesses, or extenuating circumstances due to an emergency.
Attendance
Regular attendance at all class meetings is expected. A student who misses classes or other required
activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the professor
in advance of the absence so arrangements can be made to complete an assignment or cover the class
material within a reasonable time after the absence.

University Policies
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a
student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the
University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if
you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must
cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary
action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic
Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only
allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn
differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let
me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the
requirements of the course. There are also a range of resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical
information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building
needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning
environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as
possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact
Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone).

Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and
cope with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful

resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for
help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety
or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety
and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
assembling outside.
  •   Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
      Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
  •   Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
      week of class.
  •   In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-
      enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University
      of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
  •   Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be
