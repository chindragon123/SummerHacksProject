Overview: The course examines financial reporting issues, mainly from a user perspective. The objectives are:
(1) To learn about current U.S. financial reporting;
(2) To understand whether and how financial reporting captures the economics of transactions and events, and;
(3) To learn how to reason about financial reporting problems as users do (i.e., to understand the relations
between financial statements, including footnotes, and journal entries).
Required Text: Financial Reporting and Analysis by Revsine et al. (7th Edition)
Prerequisites: ACC 311(H), ACC 312(H), FIN 357(H)
Communication Channels: The class webpage is Canvas. I may send email containing announcements.
Exams and Homework: There will be four exams, each worth 25% of your grade. Exams may include multiple-
choice, short answer and computational questions. You may have 1-page (8.5” x 11”, front/back, your own
handwriting) of notes for use during the exam, which must be turned in with your exam. Electronically prepared
exam notes will receive a LARGE penalty. Any request for a re-grade must be made IN WRITING no less than
two days and no more than seven days after the exam is returned. The request must state, in detail, the reason you
believe the grade is in error. Requests that do not conform to this policy will not be honored.
Any missed exam must be approved either in advance or through Student Emergency Services. Makeup exams
will be given only in extraordinary circumstances (at my discretion). For ordinary absences, the weight will be
assigned to the other exam. If you do not have a valid reason, you will receive a grade of zero. I reserve the right
to adjust grades for extraordinary class contribution. Homework (problems only) may be required to be turned in.
If so, they will count for 10% of the exam grade and will be due on the day of the exam. Please note that the
“Expected Dates” on the Detailed Schedule are just that; only homework for topics that will be on an exam will
be due for that particular exam. In other words, homework for incomplete topics is not due. I also reserve the right
to give quizzes, which will substitute for part of the exam. There will be no makeups for quizzes.
You should work homework exercises and problems to prepare for the exam. Working on the homework
assignments with other students is encouraged. When homework is collected, it must be stapled, with each
question clearly presented. Office hours tend to be crowded right before exams and thus keeping up with
homework is to your advantage.
Curved Grades: GRADES WILL BE BASED ON A CURVE.
I cannot stress enough that a curve means that you cannot assume ANYTHING about what a score means as far
as a grade. In other words, a score of 90 does not guarantee an “A,” nor does a score below 60 guarantee an “F.”
In general, scores in the 60s receive a “B,” although, again, this is not a guarantee.
Despite repeated explanations of this concept, many students make false assumptions that they are failing the
course or getting very low grades when they are (often) performing in the average range. Again, it all depends on
the distribution. While most students seem to understand the curve, there are misunderstandings EVERY semester
on this issue. The class average is generally expected to be approximately 3.3, although this may vary based on
my assessment of overall class performance. Plus/minus grading will be used.


Class Conduct: Professional behavior is required. In particular, please put away cell phones. If you have
unusual circumstances, speak with me about it before class. If I say nothing, this does not mean that I did not
notice it – the use of a cell phone is one of the most obvious activities to observe from the front of the room.
Please note that you may step out of the room at any time, provided you do so in a non-disruptive manner. If you
cannot live without your cell phone during class, this is not the course for you. I will impose a substantial grade
penalty for those who distract other students through cell phone use.
Class Attendance: Class attendance is important, but I do not track attendance. YOU DO NOT NEED TO
NOTIFY ME UNLESS YOUR ABSENCE WILL BE FOR AN EXTENDED TIME. Please note that if you miss
class, I will not photocopy or scan a copy of that day’s notes - you may copy them (by hand) during office hours
or get a copy from a classmate.
Students with disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
