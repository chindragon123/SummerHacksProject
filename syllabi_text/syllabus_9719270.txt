              Accounting 380D – Fall 2019
              Advanced Topics in Financial Reporting (MBA’s only)**
              Unique 02615 12:30 p.m. – 2:00 p.m. RRH 3.310
**Prerequisite is BA 284T.
Course Objectives
(1) To learn about financial-reporting topics that are most relevant to MBAs pursuing finance-related careers (sell-side analyst,
      investment banking, buy-side analyst, portfolio manager, trader, M&A consulting, treasury, corporate finance, oil and gas
      finance-related jobs, CFO, etc.) – topics from both intermediate and advanced accounting. We will also occasionally discuss
      international financial reporting so that you can know something about reports prepared under that system (not that
      dramatically different, contrary to what most believe).
(2) To consider the economics of transactions and events, and understand whether and how financial reporting captures those
      economics. This sort of thinking is the foundation for understanding how to do equity and credit analysis.
(3) To learn how to reason about financial reporting in a forward direction, similar to what preparers normally do (i.e., work
      forward from the data to journal entry to financial statement) and to learn how to reason about financial reporting problems in
      a backward direction, similar to what financial report users do (i.e., work backward from financial statement and footnote data
      to journal entry). Understanding how to work in a backward direction requires knowledge of how to work in a forward
      direction. Stated differently, it is difficult to do financial statement analysis until you more fully understand what
      goes into those financial statements and the accompanying disclosures (footnotes).

COURSE MATERIALS
   TEXTS:            INTERMEDIATE ACCOUNTING, by Kieso, Weygandt, and Warfield, 2019, 17th edition. Available for
   purchase at Co-Op in hardbound (new or used) or loose-leaf form. It’s a new edition, so not sure how many cheaper options
   exist, but you can try the usual places (Amazon.com, Chegg.com, or e-rental including Kindle). The Wiley.com website has
   an e-book rental or e-book purchase option (rental $55; purchase $180).
   ADVANCED ACCOUNTING, by Hopkins and Halsey (4th edition). Purchase three chapters from this book from Cambridge
   Publishers via online purchase: https://mybusinesscourse.com/book/financialreportingaustin#purchase
   CLASS NOTES:                      These are essential, cannot-do-without class notes. Bring the relevant parts to class
   each day. I have prepared a packet containing my class notes. These notes contain (1) my class notes, (2) the "Additional
   Problems in Class Notes" indicated on the syllabus, and (3) old exams.
   Based on feedback from students who have taken this course previously, your primary source of studying topics in this course
   probably will be these class notes. Students have indicated to me that they rely heavily on the class notes and homework
   problems to study for exams. Spending time reading every word in the textbook was not deemed as productive for several
   reasons:
        (1) we cover topics very quickly in this class and there is not much time to spend reading the textbook,
        (2) the textbook contains many accounting details that are not that important (i.e., they will never show up on
        exams),
        (3) the textbook forces students to think only about current accounting; many aspects of this course involve
        thinking about alternative perspectives, some of which are not currently allowed (but may be something you
        would want to do as part of your financial statement analysis), and
        (4) some topics are not discussed in the book.
   Thus, you are encouraged to use the textbook as a reference tool; read excerpts from the textbook as necessary. For most,
   reading the textbook on an as needed basis after we talk about a topic in class will work best. For others, reading it before
   class optimizes their performance in this class. DO WHAT WORKS BEST FOR YOU.
   Available for purchase at Jenn’s Copy and Binding (2518 Guadalupe – at intersection of Guadalupe and Dean Keeton).
   SOLUTIONS TO HOMEWORK PROBLEMS:                                                        This packet contains the solutions to all of
   the practice homework problems. It does not include those to be turned in for course credit (solutions to these will be
   available on Canvas on the homework due date). Available for purchase at Jenn’s Copy and Binding (2518 Guadalupe – at
   intersection of Guadalupe and Dean Keeton).

   COURSE REQUIREMENTS
   EXAMS:               There will be two mid-term exams and one final exam. With the exception of the final exam, each exam
   only covers the material covered in that portion of the course. The final is not cumulative, but it will have two topics from the
   previous components of the course – those are statement of cash flows and deferred taxes.
   My exams are problem based. They are not memorization exams. Accordingly, for the three exams, you can bring a 8 x 11
   “cheat sheet.” Writing/typing on both sides is acceptable.
   HOMEWORK:                       There will be 11 homework assignments. These homework assignments exist to allow you to
   stay up to date on the material (it’s easy to let things slide and somewhat disastrous in this class if you do). Homework is
   graded on an effort, not accuracy, basis.
   Homework is to be uploaded onto canvas by 10 a.m. on the due date (unless otherwise stated on the syllabus)
GRADES
   POINT ALLOCATION:
   Course grades are made on a plus-minus basis and are determined by the following weighting scheme:
      Exam 1                          250 points      25%
      Exam 2                          300 points      30%
      Final Exam                      350 points      35%
      Homework                        100 points      10%
      TOTAL POINTS                  1000 points      100%
   HOW DO I DO THE GRADING?
   Exams: Exams are problem based and so we do assign partial credit. To the extent that I can tell you made a purely math
   mistake (i.e., you wrote $100 x 40 = $3000), I do not take off points. Hence, showing your work is important.
   I grade on a curve, which is determined based on the class performance. Once I curve an exam, the curve “sticks.” That is, I
   don’t re-curve prior exams at the end of the term.
   No make-up exams will be given. Medical emergencies and family emergencies are the only valid reasons that will be
   accepted for missing an exam. You must provide supporting documentation (e.g., signed note from a physician) if you do
   miss an exam. If you are excused from an exam, the other two exams will be re-weighted (e.g., if you miss the first exam, the
   second and final exams will be re-weighted). If you do not have a valid reason for missing an exam, you will receive a zero on
   the exam, which usually implies failing the course.
   Homework: Unless otherwise noted, the homework will be graded on an effort, and not accuracy, basis. Homework is
   scored on a 0, 1, 2, 3 basis. You will receive full credit for a problem if the grader concludes that you made a reasonable
   effort; you will receive a zero if you did not turn in the homework (or turned it in late). Scores of 1 and 2 are based on partial
   completion of homework.
   Two homework assignments will be dropped (i.e., your lowest two scores will automatically be dropped at the end of the term).
   So your homework score will be based out of the highest 9 homework scores you have (out of 11 homework assignments).
   Homework is considered late (score of 0) if received after the due date/time. Why? That’s when the solutions are available on
   Canvas.

HOW TO DO WELL IN THE CLASS?
GET GOING WITH A SOLID FOUNDATION:
   I also would highly recommend that those of you who feel in any way nervous about your skills at making accounting entries to
   listen to a one-hour video I’ve done on “review of accounting.” (See Canvas for the video link.) There are class notes to
   accompany that video (also in Canvas). And if you need more, please read through Chapter 3 of the textbook and work some
   problems – either before or after my in-class review. Work through as many as you need to feel comfortable with making
   journal entries. Suggested: E3-1, E3-8, E3-20 (don’t do part B), P3-1, P3-5, P3-6, P3-8, P3-9, and P3-12. Solutions to these
   problems are on Canvas.
CLASS ATTENDANCE AND HOMEWORK:
   In my opinion, class attendance and homework are the two most important components of this course. Why?
   Reason #1: The course moves quickly. So if you miss class, you have to figure out the material on your own. That typically
   takes at least triple the time I spend on it in class. That is, easier to listen to me than to do it on your own. There is a lot of
   material in ACC 380D and I make every effort during class to indicate what is important in the real world (and, thus, this class).
   Students who generally do very well in this class are those who attend class and those who don't do as well are those who
   tend to skip class.
   Reason #2: Much of what I cover in class is not in the textbook.
   If, for some reason, you have to miss class, I strongly recommend that you obtain the class notes from someone else and, if
   possible, also have them audio record the class. It’s an easy way to ensure that you can get up to speed on the material you
   missed.
   Reason #3: Since the content of this course is largely problem oriented, doing the homework problems on a timely basis is a
   necessity. Exam performance is directly related to systematic preparation, which includes timely completion of the homework
   assignments.
   There are homework problems from the textbook and in my class notes. What is the difference? I generally write problems
   when I feel the textbook is deficient in a particular type of problem. So you should view the two as complements and not
   substitutes. If you don’t do all of the problems for a particular topic (I have a lot, because somebody always will want more –
   so they are there for you), be sure to scan all problems and make sure you get coverage on all types of problems/subtopics
   within a particular topic.
USE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE:
   CANVAS:                 I am a big user of Canvas. What do I use there, you ask?
       Solutions to homework that is turned in for credit will be available on Canvas immediately after the due date/time.
       Discussion boards are available on Canvas. The TA and I will monitor these discussion boards, providing timely answers
       to questions. I have no problem with your answering questions too (the easiest way to learn something is to try to explain it
       to somebody else); we’ll monitor those posts as well, to ensure that nothing erroneous gets posted.
       Corrections to homework solutions will be posted on the announcement portion of Canvas for the course – I’ll label them
       as MAJOR and MINOR, depending on their severity.

       Short Adobe Connect videos of me (or my hands anyway) doing the following:
       (1) doing a one-hour review of accounting to shore up your understanding of basic concepts –this video should be
            watched, as necessary, no later than Labor Day weekend, given the speed of the course – don’t fall behind;
       (2) providing a review of futures, forwards, options and swaps (early October) for those who have not had the investments
            class; and
       (3) working some homework problems for selected topics so you can see somebody solving them (this is basically a review
            session, available when it makes sense for you—works better than having an in-person review session where many
            people cannot attend due to conflicts, etc.).
                                   Departmental Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both students and
faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty.
By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all of the faculty responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this
class, you have agreed to observe all of the student responsibilities described in that document. If the application of that Policy
Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
                 Application of Departmental Policy to Writing Assignments in this Course
GRADED HOMEWORK
Working on the homework assignments with other students who are currently enrolled in ACC 380D is permitted (and
encouraged). However, merely copying the work of another student who has previously completed the homework assignment is
not permitted. Copying homework solutions from the solutions manual, another instructors’ solution packet, a previous
semesters’ solution packet, or any other source also is not permitted. Violation of this policy will be treated as an act of
“scholastic dishonesty.” Evidence of violation of this policy will be forwarded to the Dean of Students with a recommendation that
a grade of “F” be assigned in the course.
EXAMS
Each student is expected to independently complete the exams during the designated exam period. Each student should not
refer to other students’ exam solutions or discuss the exam with other students during the exam period. Violation of this policy will
be treated as an act of “scholastic dishonesty.” Evidence of non-independent work will be forwarded to the Dean of Students with
a recommendation that a grade of “F” be assigned in the course.
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning
needs be addressed and that the diversity that students bring to this class can be comfortably expressed and be viewed as a
resource, strength and benefit to all students. Please come to me at any time with any concerns.

         BIFURCATED. THE GENERAL DISCUSSION WILL BE HELPFUL FOR OUR DISCUSSION OF US GAAP IN THOSE CASES WHERE
         IT IS BIFURCATED. SO WHY DOESN’T THE TEXT JUST TALK ABOUT THIS BIFURCATION CONCEPT IN THE CASE OF US
         GAAP? THE TEXTBOOK IS NOT QUITE RIGHT WHEN IT SAYS US GAAP DOES NOT BIFURCATE CONVERTIBLE DEBT–
         UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES (CASH SETTLEMENT OPTION), IT IS BIFURCATED.
