Overview: This is a course about contemporary social and political life in urban South
Korea—to use a complex and problematic concept, about Korean modernity. It focuses
on present conditions and their historical background: on the growth of Korean
capitalism, on the perspectives of workers, white-collar employees, and students over
time, on the lifestyles of the new middle class as well as other social transformations, and
on the struggle for democracy and its aftermath. We will read ethnographies of
corporations, consumption, residential living, and protest We will also watch several
recent films.
Course Activities: Class discussion is paramount, and most classes will begin with
student presentations designed to get things going. There is also a significant amount of
formal and informal writing for this course. This course carries the Global Cultures flag.
Assignments/Grading: I’ve tried to structure this course to make discussion—both in
class and online—a significant aspect of your grade. Please come to class with the
readings completed, if at all possible. If we really start slacking off here, I reserve the
right to institute quizzes.
        There will also be some more traditional writing assignments. I will grade writing
based upon the presence and quality of an argument, your use of sources, and the
structure and style of your paper. Please do try to be accurate in grammar and spelling; I
encourage you to use the writing center or to have a friend read over a paper for errors.
That said, I will not mark off for minor English errors unless they get in the way of
comprehension or seem to indicate laziness on your part. I am here to teach writing, not
grammar, and there is a difference.
        Online reactions/discussions for at least 10 weeks     20% (2% each, low scores
                 beyond 10 dropped)
        One short (4-5 pp.) paper                              10%
        One midterm paper (7-8 pp.)                            20%
        One final paper/project (about the same)               25%
        Class leadership on readings/film                      10%
                 (A and B presentations)
        Class participation/attendance                         15%
Online reactions/discussions: For each week of the class, there is a discussion board
forum on Canvas. For most weeks at least, sometime before the end of the day of the
                                              1


Friday of that week, please post a comment. So, for example, for the week of September
4 (Tuesday), you should post by Friday September 7 at the end of the day if you want to
receive credit.
        Postings should be about a paragraph long or longer. You can comment on
something we talked about in class. You can comment on a reading, or critique it, or
raise a question, or highlight something you think is particularly important (explaining
why). You can comment on another students’ post—please do read other students’
posts—or engage in (respectful) debate. Please try to do a mix of these over the
semester—if you are only commenting on what others write, I will get the impression
that you are not reading. I may drop into the board myself, on occasion.
        Don’t summarize the readings for the sake of summarization. Don’t simply say
something is interesting, or good/bad, or that you agree/disagree without justifying your
position.
        These posts are worth two points each, and serious engagements will merit a two.
Since there are more than ten weeks to the course, you have ample opportunity to
overwrite any bad grades with better grades – I will count your top ten at the end.
        Finally, toward the final project, please keep a running file of what you wrote for
each week.
Short paper: I will assign a short paper very early on to get a feel for your writing, and to
give you a feel for how I read papers.
Midterm paper: This will be a larger assignment. It will be based on course readings (so
no outside research is necessary) but will be conceptual. There should be some choice of
topic.
Final paper/project: TBD, and likely will include some options. One possibility would
be a paper asking you to reflect on your reading reactions and present some overarching
narrative of the course. If you want to do a research paper, it can work for this
assignment also.
Class leadership on readings/film: A and B class presentations (A=5%, B=5%): Each
student will be required to give one A presentation and one B presentation over the
course of the term. A presentations should be in the 5-10 minute range (NOT more than
that). Please offer an overview of the main points and arguments of the reading or
readings for that day’s class; please do NOT attempt a full summary. B presentations
should be 5 minutes, tops. Please present three questions arising from the readings for
that day’s class as a basis for beginning class discussion. Open-ended, comparative, or
conceptual questions tend to be better than closed-ended, factual questions.
        We will sign up for presentations in the first few classes. Note that not every
class meeting will have presentation slots.
        Note: if you lead class discussion on a film, it might be a good idea to screen the
film yourself in advance, unless you are good on the spot. Such is the price of being a
cinephile.
                                               2


Class participation: This is a discussion-based class, and you will be rewarded for the
quantity and quality of your participation. Attendance is one factor here as well (I will
take attendance at the beginning of some classes, and bad attendance without proper
notification will certainly hurt). At the same time, if you are the vocal type please be
respectful of other students and give others a chance to speak as well.
I will make use of plus/minus grading. Generally, I regard averages >=92 (rounded) as
an A, 89-91 as an A-, 87-88 as a B+, 82-86 as a B, and so on at equivalent points down
the scale.
Academic Dishonesty/Cheating can result in automatic course failure and a report to the
appropriate Dean. Your work on papers should be your own; you should cite sources (I
don’t care in what format) when you make use of them.

Readings/Films: I’ve ordered the following books for this course, all available at the
Coop. They are also on reserve at PCL. I recommend buying/acquiring the books (there
or elsewhere) as soon as you commit to the course, if possible, since the Coop returns
books to the publisher early in the term and it is best to order additional books early if
that becomes necessary:
           Laura C. Nelson, Measured Excess.
           Jesook Song, Living on Your Own.
           Roger Janelli with Dawnhee Yim, Making Capitalism.
           Namhee Lee, The Making of Minjung.
           Jiyeon Kang, Igniting the Internet.
           All other readings will be on Canvas.
           Films are also an important component of this course. If you miss a showing in
class, I expect you to go and watch the film yourself at the Fine Arts Library. You may
need to request the film in advance.
