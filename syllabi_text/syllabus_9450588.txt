Course Summary
This course provides an introduction to architectural materials conservation and its
applicability in the field of historic preservation within the United States. Students will learn
how to collect, examine, and provide treatment recommendations for the conservation of
historic building materials.
Each class will have a lecture and laboratory component. Lectures will cover the physical and
chemical properties of masonry, concrete, metals, mortars, wood, paintings and coatings, and
other materials found in historic buildings. Laboratory exercises will cover mortar and historic
finish analysis, wood identification, solubility, and micro chemical testing. Testing to determine
products for basic conservation treatments, including cleaning and consolidation, will also be
covered. Assignments will include laboratory reports, reading responses, a midterm
examination, and a final independent project that will evaluate materials for a historic site.
Prerequisite
Construction I, or with permission of instructor.

entering the building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor
in writing during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of
faculty or class instructors. Do not reenter a building unless given instructions by the following:
Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire
Prevention Services office. Information regarding emergency evacuation routes and
emergency procedures can be found at: www.utexas.edu/emergency.
