                                                              COURSE DESCRIPTION
                                      This introductory course provides an overview of
                                      individual differences among people across age
                                      levels. The course focuses on basic concepts,
                                      issues, and ways to accommodate individuals
                                      whose features and/or conditions make them
                                      "different" and worthy of consideration.

                                          Learning occurs best when participants are
                                          enjoying what they are doing. I love to teach this
                                          course and will have fun being the instructor for
                                          this course. I am hopeful that you will find the
                                          sessions to be
                                              informative and engaging. Each session will
                                                include a mixture of instructional
                                                 techniques, including lecture, discussion,
                                          guest presenters, video & audio clips, and/or in-
                                          class activities. I believe that you will find that the
                                          time goes by relatively quickly.

Grade of incomplete. The grade of "Incomplete" will be granted only if a student has
completed 75% of the course. This grade designation will result from a request from a
student based on extraordinary personal or academic reasons, or by me, when deemed
necessary. A due date for completing the course will be negotiated by the student and the
instructor. If the course is not completed by the agreed upon due date, the grade
corresponding to the number of points already earned will be submitted or will
automatically convert to a grade of “F” by the university system.
Due dates. The due dates for certain course requirements can be extended unconditionally
for one week, if an electronic or written request is received one week prior to the due
date via email -- much like requesting an extension for filing income tax.

Course-Related Accommodations. I have tried to design this class using the principle of
universal design whereby most elements of the course are designed to accommodate a
wide range of student needs. However, I am prepared and quite willing to accommodate
any special needs that a student might have and for which I have not taken into
consideration in the design of the course. I will comply completely and without
reservation to any official directives provided by the Services for Students with Disabilities
Office (www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd). I also encourage you to meet with me if you
have any learning-related needs about which I should be aware.
Religious Considerations: Policy for absences due to religious holy days is set in the
Texas Education Code. The code states that a student who misses an examination, work
assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day must be given
an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence,
provided he or she has properly notified each instructor. It is the policy of The University
of Texas at Austin that the student must notify each instructor at least 14 days prior to the
classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent. For religious holidays that fall within
the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given on the first day of the
semester. The student may not be penalized for these absences, but the instructor may
appropriately respond if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed assignment
or examination within a reasonable time after the excused absence.

Readings. Assigned readings should be completed prior to class. Various activities based
on the readings will occur in class.
                                                                                 Due: ongoing
Out-of-Class Activities (OCA). I am going to ask you to do approximately fifteen (15)
outside-class activities. These activities are designed to engage you in a topic that we will
be covering in an upcoming session. Your response will be due the night before class to
allow us to review the responses prior to the session. The OCA information will be
provided in the module for a particular session. Each activity will be worth 1 point.
                                                    Product: upload your response via Canvas

In-Class Activities (ICA). During the course of this term, typically there will be two in-
class activities (ICAs) every session. These activities will relate to the assigned readings
and topics covered in class. You will receive points for completing the activities.
However, as indicated earlier, to receive the point(s) for the ICAs, you must be in class at
the time of the activity. Each activity is typically worth 1 point.

Single Most Important Thing (SMIT): At the end of each class session, you should
submit a brief statement that captures, in your opinion, the single most important point
that was discussed during the session. You will receive one point for completing the
SMIT for each class session. However, as indicated earlier, to receive the point for your
SMIT, you must have been in attendance for the session.

Knowledge Assessments (KA). I will be administering three knowledge assessments
during the semester. The KAs are based on assigned readings and content covered in
class -- typically an even balance of both sources. Each KA will include material covered
since the previous KA. If you have a legitimate conflict with any of the scheduled dates,
see a TA as soon as possible. The KAs come in three formats: multiple-choice; short-
answer; and oral. The default format is multiple-choice – however, if you feel that you
require a different type of assessment format, see a TA prior to the first KA.
NOTE#1: All KA make-ups are the short-answer format.
NOTE#2: The KAs must be taken to receive a passing grade for the course.
NB: You are encouraged to examine your KA performance. If you feel that you can
provide a sound, logical argument for why any of your choices should be accepted, you
can submit a written response. You have until the date of the next KA to file a response.

Assistive & Instructional Technology (AIT) Lab Visitation. Site visits to the AIT Lab in
SZB 518e are required to better acquaint students in ALD 322 with the use of assistive
technology (AT) across a number of settings in which individuals with special needs
work, learn, and live. Specific information about this assignment is provided in the “AIT
Lab Orientation Assignment Information” guidelines that are located in the AIT Lab
module on Canvas.
    You will need to sign-up for a visit to the lab online early in the term – procedures for signing up
    are provided in the guidelines and will be discussed in class. Specific dates for when the actual
    orientations begin and when you will have the last opportunity to visit the AIT lab are provided
    in the guidelines. I strongly advise that you sign up as soon as you can – this class is not the only
    one doing these visits.
    You should collect information that is requested on the “Site Visit Form” – use this form to take
    notes when you are doing the visit – this form is also found in the module. After you complete
    your visit and have word-processed your notes, you should upload the Site Visit Form via Canvas
    (AIT Lab module). This course requirement will be evaluated on the following criteria:
            (a) completing the site visit, as verified by the sign-in sheet given to me by the AT lab
            staff at the end of the term;
            (b) completing the AIT lab evaluation; and
            (c) submitting a completed report that reflects thoroughness and effort.

Individual Project (IP). This is an individual project. Each student must develop a project
that relates to his/her future choice of career. The nature of this project will depend on
your area of focus (i.e., major) and career goals. Details of the IP will be discussed in
class and elaborated on in the guidelines that are provided in the “IP module” on Canvas.
NOTE#1: Separate guidelines are provided for teachers and non-teachers.
NOTE#2: You are welcome to do whichever one you prefer; however, I recommend
that teachers do the teacher version.

                                                  the course. The grade you earn for this
      Weighting and Grade                     course depends on the TOTAL number of points
                                              you earn throughout the term. The point values
                                             for each course requirement and the scale that
                                                will be used to determine a final grade are

        Course Feature                                Information
Discussion Section of Cv    I am going to use the discussion feature of Canvas in a variety
                            of ways this term. However, you do NOT have to engage
                            some of them.
                            NB: if you just missed the cut-off for a grade, I will bump up
                            your grade, if, and only if, you have made at least two (2)
                            postings to any of the treads in the discussion forum named
                            “Topics of Interest” or the discussion forum named
                            “Accessibility Violations.”

Course Protocol/ Guidelines I am asking you to honor the following requests:
                                *respect other class members & my guests
                                *ask questions during class
                                *let me know if there are environmental needs/problems
                                *let me know in advance -- if you are going to miss class
                                    or have to leave class early
Phone use in class          In all likelihood, there will NEVER be a need to use your
                            smartphone in class. As a result, please place your iPhones,
                            Androids, or other devices in the “silent” mode.
Computer use in class       You will NEED to bring your laptop or tablet to class.
                            However, I would ask that you NOT use your computer for
                            non-class-related purposes.
                            NB: I may designate “digital-free times” when EVERYONE
                            must close his/her computer, etc.


In Class Behavior      I will KNOW who you are and will be cognizant of your in-
                       class behavior – so, if I feel that there is a problem with in-
                       class behavior (e.g., behavior that interferes with the learning
                       of others and actually your own (e.g., excessive chatting;
                       excessive non-class-related digital use -- constantly looking at
                       your computer but no notetaking), you are likely to HEAR
                       from me privately. However, I encourage students to speak
                       directly to one another about any problem that arise.
Study Guide            I will post a comprehensive study early in the term and to
                       which you can refer throughout the term.
Plagiarism             UT Senate: “if you use words or ideas that are not your own
                       you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of
                       plagiarism.”
                       I am becoming increasing aware of this problem ... so, I
                       strongly recommend that you comply with issue of scholarly
                       integrity.
Syllabus               A syllabus establishes a “working relationship” between the
                       student and the course instructor. Participation in this course
                       indicates your acceptance of its content, requirements, and
                       policies. Please review this syllabus in detail as soon as
                       possible (and click the “Accept” button!).
Supports for students  UT provides a number of support services for students. An
                       initial overview of services can be found at the Dean of
                       Students website (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu). Please see
                       me if you have any questions or concerns.
Withdrawal from course If you believe that the purpose, goals, policies, requirements,
                       or some other aspect of this course does not meet your
                       interests, needs, or expectations, you should drop the class by
                       the drop/add deadline. Note that other sections (and
                       instructors) of ALD 322 are available this term at UT, and,
                       given that variations in policies and requirements do exist
                       across sections, you may want to explore these other options.
                       If you do decide to drop this course or this section of the
                       ALD 322, I wish you the best.
