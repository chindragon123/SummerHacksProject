Course Description
This course will explore the theory, history, practice and poetics of documentary for, by, and/or about
underrepresented communities. With a particular emphasis people of color, students will engage
documentary as a vital practice of activism and self-preservation. Students will be introduced to
influential documentaries across a wide range of styles and modes (expository, observational,
performative, reflexive, poetic, interactive) and will explore critical topics in documentary production
and reception: fictions of realism, authenticity and objectivity; histories of ethnography; questions of
documentary ethics; aesthetic strategies of documentary art and activism; politics of self-representation;
mockumentaries and the lampooning of “truth.” Class assignments will be a combination of written and
creative work, and students will have the opportunity to create their own short documentary or
documentary prospectus for their final project. This class is built on the syllabus of Dr. Curran Nault, the
originator of this course.
Course Goals
After successfully completing this course, students will have the ability to:
    . discuss how the documentary has and should be defined
    . debate claims of documentary authenticity, realism and objectivity
    . understand documentary tactics of propaganda and persuasion
    . contemplate complex questions of documentary ethics
    . identify major historical trends in minority documentary, as well as key minority doc texts
    . recognize documentary styles and modes, including their relative advantages and limitations
    . critique representation across a range of documentaries, from the popular to the subcultural
    . appreciate activist documentary practices and strategies, related to both content and form

    Quizzes: On Thursdays, during “lecture weeks,” there will be a short quiz on that week’s reading
    assignments and related themes. These quizzes are designed to test your comprehension of
    fundamental concepts and may take a variety of forms, from multiple choice to short answers. Your
    lowest quiz grade will be dropped.

    Journals: During “screening weeks,” in lieu of reading assignments, students will write in their
    Canvas course “journal”—a journal in the form of "documentary" logs being a natural choice in a
    documentary studies class. In it you will record your reactions to class screenings. Your journal
    should be thoughtful and specific—and should include both "factual" details and critical insights into
    what you are seeing. Often you will be given a specific question(s) to address. However, at times
    you will be at liberty to write about what most interests you most. Your journal entries will be
    housed on Canvas and are due by class on Thursday during screening weeks. Journal entries will
    be reviewed throughout the semester. Students are encouraged to read and engage each other’s work.
    Midterm Essay (4 pages): Students will document the experiences of an individual of interest, via
    an “oral history” essay. This entails: 1) conducting an interview with the chosen individual; and, 2)
    composing an essay that provides an analytic framework for their story, situating their voice within
    this framework. You will not be able to write about their entire life story, but instead will focus on
    one or two themes discussed by the interviewee, analyzing their testimony based on knowledge
    gained in the course from readings, lectures, films, and discussions. In doing so, you will be required
    to use secondary sources to flesh out your essay. Further instructions to be provided at a later date.
    Final Project (3-8 pages): Drawing on knowledge gained from the course, students will have the
    opportunity to create their own (5-10min.) short documentary accompanied by a brief 3 page paper
    reflecting on the project and its relation to course materials. Students will also have the option of
    writing a documentary prospectus: a detailed narrative, ~8 pages in length, offering a comprehensive
    description of a hypothetical documentary project. The documentary prospectus should actively
    engage course materials and include:
    • a narrative describing your documentary—its topic, format/style and approach
    • rationale for choosing your particular documentary topic, format/style and approach
    • discussion of intended audience and audience effect, including tactics of persuasion
    • discussion of related documentary texts (and how yours will differ from them)
    • discussion of your hypothetical research strategy and production tasks
    • discussion of potential ethical issues involved in your documentary’s production
    a bibliography of primary and secondary sources, including at least 3 class texts. Further details
    related to these final project options will be provided later in the semester.
    Attendance and Participation: In a small class such as this, you will only learn what you
    contribute. To do well in this class, you must both speak and listen. Students who rarely speak will
    receive low participation credit. Students who talk a lot but clearly have not thought about the
    materials will also receive low credit. You are expected to attend all classes on-time and prepared in
    order to participate in discussion and in-class exercises. This means you read and watch all required
    text and arrive to class with questions and thoughtful comments on them. Unexcused absence, late
    arrival and early departure from class will be penalized. Four unexcused absences will result in an
    “F” for the entire class. Tardy arrival and early departure will be counted as half an unexcused
    absence.
    Grading Criteria: Rubrics will be posted for each assignment in Canvas. You will receive high
    grades in this class if you are diligent in your reading and writing, you show a clear understanding of
    the materials, and you work to foster a rigorous and stimulating intellectual environment. For
    critical/analytical exercises, this means that you integrate course readings into your writings, you
    devise and support a strong and thoughtful argument, and you submit work that is free from
    grammatical and syntactical errors. For creative exercises, this means that you show knowledge of

    concepts, integration of creative and theoretical ideas, extensive process work, attention to craft, and
    an overall rigorous and diligent attitude. Documentation as well as presentation of your creative
    project is integral to your grade. Based on these criteria: A=excellent, B=good, C=average, D=below
    average, F=failing. If you feel that your grades do not match the effort you are exerting, please see
    me during my office hours.
Class Expectations/Ground Rules
    Cultural Diversity in the United States Flag: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in
    the United States. The purpose of the Cultural Diversity in the United States Flag is for students to
    explore in depth the shared practices and beliefs of one or more underrepresented cultural groups
    subject to persistent marginalization. In addition to learning about these diverse groups in relation to
    their specific contexts, students should engage in an active process of critical reflection. You should
    therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the
    practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one underrepresented cultural group in the U.S.
    Discussions: Because of the nature of critical race, performance, and queer studies, this class will at
    times make you feel uncomfortable. You may find other classmates or even myself saying things
    that may offend or shock you. Listen well. Discuss topics rigorously using the course materials to
    support your arguments. Personal narratives can be helpful but be mindful of when you are using
    personal experience as evidence for an argument or for personal reasons. Respect each other as
    fellow scholars and me as your facilitator and designated expert. Become experts in your own right
    and challenge one another to think deeply. Please avoid dominating conversation, name-calling, and
    silencing others.
    Use of Electronics: Please turn off your cell phones while in class. I strongly recommend using pen
    and notebook to take notes. Studies have shown that typing notes does little for committing
    information to memory while hand-written notes help you to remember. I encourage you to incline
    yourself toward remembering. Use your laptop judiciously. Please be courteous. Surfing the web or
    social networking during discussions will result in me asking you to leave class.
    Late Policy: If you turn an assignment in late, I will dock one-third of a letter grade for every day it
    is late (B turns into B-, etc.). I will not accept papers more than five days late. Please note that I will
    not accept late final projects.
Incompletes
Students are not permitted to take an Incomplete for this course, except in the case of a documented
health or family emergency discussed in advance with me. If you feel you are falling behind in your
work, it is your responsibility to meet with me and formulate a plan of action well in advance of the end
of the semester so that you can complete the course successfully.
Services for Students with Disabilities
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. Students with physical or learning disabilities should provide the
professor with a letter requesting reasonable academic accommodation, and work directly with the
professor to determine what accommodations are needed. This letter can be obtained from Services for
Students with Disabilities, located in the Student Services Building. For more information, contact the
Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY, or visit their website at:

The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold these
values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Scholastic Dishonesty
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process.
Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading information to
receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of
essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor.
By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic
dishonesty damages both the student’s learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a
work-career. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. For
more information on scholastic dishonesty, please visit the Student Judicial services website at
deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs.
Religious Holidays
Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If you miss a work
assignment or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day you will be given an
opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. It is the policy of
the University of Texas at Austin that you must notify your instructor at least fourteen days prior to the
classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a religious holy day.
Title IX
Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses
subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against
other protected categories such as race, national, origin, etc. Please be aware all faculty members are
“responsible employees,” which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment,
sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I must share that information with the
Title IX Coordinator. Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be
handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. If you or someone you know
has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate resources here:
