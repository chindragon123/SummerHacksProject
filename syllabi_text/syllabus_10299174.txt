Overview
This class investigates how the politics of the earth (‘geopolitics’) currently function and
imagines a radical reconception through Black, Indigenous, postcolonial and transnational
feminisms. We will examine how human geographies and modern notions of the human are
made through colonial hierarchies (Wynter, 1995) and consider the possibilities of
disrupting and unmaking racial logics through place-based praxis (McKittrick, 2006).
Drawing on feminist analyses of how power operates within, across, and against states, and
the enrollment of gender, sexuality, and bodies (human and not) in imperialist and racist
projects, we will ask:
How is empire constituted through intimacies and interconnections among seemingly
disparate events and places?
How do racism and coloniality operate geopolitically across contexts and peoples?
What is feminist praxis, in service to anti-imperialism, decolonization and anti-racism?
This graduate seminar offers an interdisciplinary feminist approach to geopolitics that
rescales the global through the intimate; examines the body and the collective as site, scale,
                                                                                             1


and strategy of power; and takes seriously the erotic, the material, the emotional, the queer
and the discarded as sources of power.
About me
I am a geographer working in critical race and feminist studies. I use cultural
methodologies, including performance and visual methods, to study environmental racism
in collaboration with those who lives are devastated by global capitalism. I enjoy teaching
as part of my scholarship and activism, and am interested in how we can create a more just
university. In my past life, I ran afterschool programs for high school youth, developed
curricula for nonprofits, and danced professionally. I am a lifelong student of movement,
trained in traditional and contemporary South Asian dance forms, yoga and Aikido, and I
bring this bodily sensibility to my work.

Text Engagement
The purpose of the Discussion Forum is to provide a space for you to engage in dialogue
with colleagues in close reading of scholarly texts and application of theoretical constructs
to empirical work. You are encouraged to bring your insights and questions into class for
further discussion.
Discussion forum: Reflections (3 required)
Reflections are short essays (250-375 words) that summarize the key contributions or
interventions of the week’s readings, draw connections across the material, and raise
questions or critiques you may have, and reflect on the relevance of the texts for your own
work. Please take care to cite sources for direct quotes as well as paraphrased material.
Reflections must be posted by 9:00am on Monday.
Discussion forum: Responses (2 required)
Responses are short essays (250-375 words) replying directly to a classmate’s Reflection.
You may offer constructive clarifications or alternate readings of the text, respond to the
questions/concerns posed, or suggest ideas that engage and further their work. Consider
responding as a generous collaborator, rather than positioning yourself as an expert. Your
Responses must be posted by 9:00am on Tuesday.
Seminar Facilitation
You will work with a partner to facilitate the seminar one week. Be prepared to do
additional preparation beyond simply reading the text. You will be responsible for 90 min.
of class time.
Include the following in your presentation:
    • An opening activity that involves analysis of a current event through the tools of
        feminist geopolitics
    • Brief and relevant context situating the author and text
    • Group discussion through close reading of the text
                                                                                              3


Facilitation guide
Please note: you must upload an agenda by 11:59pm on Sunday, so plan accordingly.
Your agenda must be detailed, including objectives for the session, activities broken down
by time, questions you will raise, plans for structuring discussion, as well as any concerns
you may have.
Reading guide
Create a handout that accompanies your presentation and provides a curated summary of
the reading material. Your handout must include guiding questions, key quotes or other
information you would like to highlight from the reading as well as a brief biography of the
author. The handout is a valuable tool to enable collaborative knowledge production. Please
make sure to cite any and all sources you draw on.
Scholarly Production
For the final paper, you will write a scholarly article or thesis/dissertation chapter (5000-
10000 words) following disciplinary conventions in your field, that is grounded in and
draws on the course material. All assignments must be submitted on Canvas.
This is a scaffolded assignment with four components:
Proposal is the seed of an idea you wish to develop over the course of the semester. You will
develop a short (5 min.) oral presentation of your project idea, for feedback from peers.
Please include relevant background information, a thesis statement, and a brief overview of
theory you plan to engage. If you choose to write an article, identify a respected peer-
reviewed journal in your field, and indicate the name of the journal and their word limit.
Preparation is an Outline of the article or chapter you envision writing. Following the
aesthetic and technical conventions of your chosen journal/discipline, create a detailed
outline. Include a thesis, section headings, one sentence summaries of each paragraph,
citation of relevant literature you plan to include, and any other information that would
help guide your writing.
Process is the Rough Draft of your paper, to be reviewed by two others in the class. Write as
though this is your actual submission to the journal; in other words, this is a complete draft,
fully written, including all sections, and within the word count (including references). Your
grade for this component will be based on the peer reviews and my reading.
Product is the Final Draft of your paper, intended to be close to publication-ready. Your
submission must include a cover letter addressing the suggestions offered in the peer
review process.
