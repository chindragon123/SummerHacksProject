Class Time and Location:
Lectures: Wednesdays, CBA 4M.204, 3:00 - 6:00 p.m.
Course Description
The course consist of three parts: lectures and exercises, paper discussions, and a course
project.
1. Lectures and Exercises
The lectures are intended to provide students with an introduction to contract theory and
rational expectations models, in particular, hidden information (screening and signaling),
hidden action (moral hazard), and disclosure. I will loosely follow the book “Contract
Theory” by Patrick Bolton and Mathias Dewatripont. Participants are required to follow the
relevant chapters in the book. The goal of the lectures is to provide participants with the
knowledge to understand and analyze state-of-the-art papers in accounting. The lectures will
be accompanied by problem sets which I will distribute in class. The solutions to some of the
problems will also be discussed in class. It is important that participants try to solve these
problems prior to the discussion of the solution.
2. Paper Discussions
Given the time constraints of the course, we cannot possibly provide a comprehensive
coverage of modeling in accounting. The papers selected are intended to provide an
introduction to various topics. Thus, the idea of the course is not to "teach" you the specific
papers assigned. Your emphasis should be on using the papers to learn how to "do" research.
In reading each paper, you should try to answer these generic questions:
    (1) What is the question being asked? Why is it interesting and/or important? To whom
         is it interesting?


Acc 386K.4 Syllabus
Spring 2020
     (2) How was the analysis structured? How might the analysis have been structured
         differently? What assumptions were made? What assumptions were made for
         mathematical convenience and what assumptions drive the results? Are the
         assumptions reasonable?
     (3) What are the major / primary results? Do they make sense?
     (4) How can the paper be improved, extended, or generalized, either to answer a related
         (but different) question, to "test" the sensitivity of the existing answer, or to broaden
         the applicability of the answer?
     (5) To the extent possible, how does the paper relate to other papers or lines of research?
         (For this question, I invite you to bring in your knowledge of research using other
         methodologies – e.g., archival or experimental.)
Presenters
Some of the papers listed in the course overview will be pre-assigned to a student to present in
class. The task of the presenter is to explain as intuitively as possible what the main
insight/lesson of the paper is and why it is interesting (or not). The presenter has exactly 5
minutes.
Non-presenters
Everyone is expected to read assigned paper. Your active participation in class is important.
3. Course Project
The last three weeks of the course will be devoted to an analytical project. Most of you will
not have (or take) another opportunity to execute such a project. While it is relatively easy to
criticize the simplifying assumptions of models, it is quite another thing to formulate a model
that generates interesting insights. I will provide detailed information regarding the project
prior to the Spring Break. Papers will be due by Tuesday, April 28.
Grades
Your grade in the course will be determined as follows:
                 Short Presentations                                      10%

                 Second Exam                                              30%

  Students with Disabilities
  Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division
  of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259,
  http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/.
  Diversity and Inclusion
  It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by
  this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed and that the diversity that students
  bring to this class can be comfortably expressed and be viewed as a resource, strength and
  benefit to all students. Please come to me at any time with any concerns.
  Religious Holy Days
  By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
  the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
  assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an
  opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
  Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
  The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
  responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described
  in detail in the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at
  http://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics. By teaching this course, I have agreed to
  observe all faculty responsibilities described there. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed
  to observe all student responsibilities described there. If the application of the Statement on
  Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your
  responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University rules on scholastic
  dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course
  and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, the
  integrity of the University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on scholastic
  dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to the Student Conduct and Academic
  Integrity website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/ to access the official University
  policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what
  constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
