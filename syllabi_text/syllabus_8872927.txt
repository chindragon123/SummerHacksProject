Exams and Quizzes: All exams and quizzes are closed book, closed notes. Exams and
                        quizzes will include material covered in reading assignments and
                        class discussions. Exam make-ups will be given only in the event
                        of a verified emergency or doctor-verified sickness.
                        The final exam for this class will be optional for those students
                        who achieve a C grade or better (≥74/100) on both of the first
                        two exams. Any student who meets the above criterion and
                        chooses not to take the final exam will have their midterm exam
                        grade represent 50% of their course grade.
                        Short quizzes will be given occasionally at the beginning of class.
                        The average of these quizzes will constitute 10% of the final grade.
                        No make-up quizzes will be given.
Homework:               You may discuss homework problems with other members of the
                        class, but your write-up must be done individually. Copying of
                        homework solutions from others is not allowed. You may turn in
                        up to two homework assignments late (no more than one week
                        after the actual deadline). Other than that, no late homework
                        will be accepted. The late exception does not apply to the class
                        project reports.

Behavior:               Please do not talk to your classmates during the lecture as this
                        disrupts the learning environment. (Class activities organized by
                        instructor are excluded). Please always bring your Calculator.
                        Please keep your cell phone silent.
Attendance:             Although it is in your own best interest to attend class, I do not
                        intend to check attendance. If for some reason you do not come to
                        class, it is your responsibility to make sure that you are aware of
                        any announcements that have been made and that you are familiar
                        with the material covered in class. Please notice that No make-up
                        quizzes will be given.
Office Hours:           I encourage all students to come and see me outside of class. This
                        gives me an opportunity to explain concepts that may be unclear, to
                        get feedback on how the class is going, and to get to know you. As
                        far as possible, however, I ask that you restrict this activity to the
                        scheduled office hours.
Problems:               If you experience difficulty with the course material or encounter
                        unexpected academic or personal problems during the semester
                        that might impact upon your performance in the class, please let
                        me know as soon as possible. I am always willing to help those
                        who are honest and who accept responsibility for their own actions.
Special Needs:          The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request,
                        appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with
                        disabilities. For more information, contact the Division of
                        Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with
                        Disabilities, 512-471-6259 or
                        http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd.
Academic Honesty:       Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are
                        subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure
                        in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
                        dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of
                        the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
                        enforced. For further information, please visit the Student Judicial
                        Services web site http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.
Dropping the Class:     From the 1st through the 12th class day, an undergraduate student
                        can drop a course via the web and receive a refund, if eligible.
                        From the 13th class day through the university’s academic drop
                        deadline, a student may Q drop a course with approval from the
                        Dean, and departmental advisor.
Course/instructor       An evaluation of the course and instructor will be conducted at the
Evaluation:             end of the semester using the approved UT Course/Instructor
                        evaluation forms.
