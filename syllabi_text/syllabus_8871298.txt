COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course will explore the theory, history, practice and poetics of minority documentary. With a particular
emphasis on Asian and African American examples, students will engage documentary as a vital practice of
minority activism and self-preservation. Students will be introduced to influential documentaries across a
wide range of styles and modes (expository, observational, performative, reflexive, poetic, interactive) and
will explore critical topics in documentary production and reception: fictions of realism, authenticity and
objectivity; histories of ethnography; questions of documentary ethics; aesthetic strategies of documentary art
and activism; politics of self-representation; mockumentaries and the lampooning of “truth.” Class
assignments will be a combination of written and creative work, and students will have the opportunity to
create their own short documentary or documentary prospectus for their final project.
COURSE GOALS
After successfully completing this course, students will have the ability to:
         discuss how the documentary has and should be defined
         debate claims of documentary authenticity, realism and objectivity
         understand documentary tactics of propaganda and persuasion
         contemplate complex questions of documentary ethics
         identify major historical trends in minority documentary, as well as key minority doc texts
         recognize various documentary styles and modes, including their relative advantages and limitations
         critique minority representation across a range of documentaries, from the popular to the subcultural
         appreciate activist documentary practices and strategies, related to both content and form
         grasp the particulars, politics and peculiarities of Asian American documentary
REQUIRED TEXTS
All readings will be posted on Canvas. Students are responsible for retrieving and printing them.

Grading Scale: This class will use the standard +/- grading scale.
GUIDELINES
Quizzes: On Thursdays, during “lecture weeks,” there will be a short quiz on that week’s reading assignments
and related themes. These quizzes are designed to test your comprehension of fundamental concepts and may
take a variety of forms, from multiple choice to short answers. Note: With advanced notice, take-home quizzes
and small creative projects may be substituted for an in-class quiz. Your lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
Journals: During “screening weeks,” in lieu of reading assignments, students will write in their Canvas course
“journal”—a journal in the form of "documentary" logs being a natural choice in a documentary studies class. In
it you will record your reactions to class screenings. Your journal should be thoughtful and specific—and should
include both "factual" details and critical insights into what you are seeing. Often you will be given a specific
question(s) to address. However, at times you will be at liberty to write about what most interests you most. Your
journal entries will be housed on Canvas and are due by Noon on Wednesday during screening weeks. Journal
entries will be reviewed throughout the semester. Students are encouraged to read and engage each other’s work.
Midterm Essays: Students will document the experiences of an individual of interest, via a 4 page “oral history”
essay. This entails: 1) conducting an interview with the chosen individual; and, 2) composing an essay that
provides an analytic framework for their story, situating their voice within this framework. You will not be able
to write about their entire life story, but instead will focus on one or two themes discussed by the interviewee,
analyzing their testimony based on knowledge gained in the course from readings, lectures, films, and
discussions. In doing so, you will be required to use secondary sources to flesh out your essay. Note: These
essays will be revised and resubmitted for a final grade. Further instructions to be provided at a later date.
Final Project: Drawing on knowledge gained from the course, students will have the opportunity to create their
own (5-10min.) short documentary accompanied by a brief 3 page paper reflecting on the project and its relation
to course materials. Students will also have the option of writing a documentary prospectus: a detailed narrative,
~8 pages in length, offering a comprehensive description of a hypothetical documentary project. The
documentary prospectus should actively engage course materials and include:
                       a narrative describing your documentary—its topic, format/style and approach
                       rationale for choosing your particular documentary topic, format/style and approach
                       discussion of intended audience and audience effect, including tactics of persuasion
                       discussion of related documentary texts (and how yours will differ from them)
                       discussion of your hypothetical research strategy and production tasks
                       discussion of potential ethical issues involved in your documentary’s production
                       a bibliography of primary and secondary sources, including at least 3 class texts
Further details related to these final project options will be provided later in the semester.
Attendance: Students are expected to attend all class meetings. Please be respectful of your classmates and the
professor by arriving on time. Unexcused class absences will adversely affect your attendance grade.
Participation: Class Participation is a grade that must be earned; it requires more than being a warm body in
class. For a high grade, you must be an active participant. This means consistently asking and answering
questions, and listening attentively and respectfully to the instructor and to your classmates. This also means
keeping up with class readings, screenings and assignments and coming to class prepared to engage.
                                                                                                                   2


Cultural Diversity Flag: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural
Diversity courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural
experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of U.S. cultural groups that have experienced persistent marginalization.
Writing Flag: This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the
semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve
your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one of your assignments, and you will be asked to read
and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your
written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communi-
cation, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
CLASS POLICIES
Incompletes: Students are not permitted to take an Incomplete for this course, except in the case of a
documented health or family emergency discussed in advance with the professor. If you feel you are falling
behind in your work, it is your responsibility to meet with the professor and formulate a plan of action well in
advance of the end of the semester so that you can complete the course successfully.
Services for Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. Students with physical or learning disabilities
should provide the professor with a letter requesting reasonable academic accommodation, and work directly
with the professor to determine what accommodations are needed. This letter can be obtained from Services for
Students with Disabilities, located in the Student Services Building. For more information, contact the Office of
the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY, or visit their website at:
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.
The University of Texas Honor Code: The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning,
discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.
Scholastic Dishonesty: The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized
collaboration, falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning
process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading information to
receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the
same written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By accepting this
syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonest damages both the
student’s learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who violate
University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure
in the course and/or dismissal from the University. For more information on scholastic dishonesty, please visit
the Student Judicial services website at deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs.
Religious Holidays: Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If you miss a
work assignment or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day you will be given an opportunity
to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. It is the policy of the University of Texas
at Austin that you must notify your instructor at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you
will be absent to observe a religious holy day.
Course Content: At times, we will be discussing/viewing material that may be disturbing to some students. In a
class dedicated to minority documentary, the engagement of significant, but sometimes difficult, issues related to
race, gender, etc., is to be expected. If you ever feel the need to step outside during one of these discussions /
viewings, you may do so without academic penalty. You will, however, be responsible for material you miss.
