Course Description. ​Over the twentieth century, the mainstream of linguistics has increasingly excluded social,
cultural, political, and economic considerations from the study of language. Both sociolinguistics and linguistic
anthropology have emerged as fields of inquiry offering alternatives to this asocial vision of language, and they have
done so in large measure through the investigation and theorization of language variation.
           In this course, we begin by looking back over a number of influential modes of studying language variation
to better understand the diverse ways in which social factors, broadly conceived, are integrated into the study of
language in contemporary sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. In particular, we review: 1) classic texts of
variationist and interactional sociolinguistics to gain a sense of how language variation was constituted as a domain
amenable to sociological and anthropological treatment; 2) later waves of sociolinguistics that have emphasized
matters of style, identity, agency, and social meaning as factors that drive and structure language variability; 3)
enregisterment as a way in which culture, ideology, and intertextuality have been integrated with the study of
language variation; and 4) new directions of research that highlight political and economic considerations of value,
power, and institutionalized structures of inequality shaping contemporary ecologies of language in the United
States and around the world. We also consider a number of exemplary recent monographs that take up a wide
range of topics related to language variation, including code switching, language change, standardization, language
shift, multilingualism, language endangerment, among others.

Class Preparation & Participation. ​The success of the class depends on everyone’s active and informed
participation. Completing the reading and taking time to process it before arriving in class is essential. So too is
coming with points to raise in discussion. The aim is to develop your own critical and constructive perspective on
the material we cover; and the only way to do that is to share your thoughts and engage with others’ perspectives
in class. To help this process along, please come to each class with the following:
              1.   3 brief selections from the week's readings—a sentence, a paragraph—that you find significant.
                   Come prepared to discuss why you find those sections of the reading particularly important to
                   understanding the argument and contribution the authors aim to make.
              2.   2 points of similarity or contrast between things in the week's reading and other readings we've
                   covered in the course or other readings you've encountered elsewhere. Please be prepared to
                   briefly summarize any readings that we might not all be familiar with.
              3.   2 criticisms of the week's reading. Feel free to use other readings, other data, or your own
                   research in developing a critical perspective on the week's reading and how the flaws you identify
                   might be overcome.
We will use your selections, comparisons, and criticisms to help organize our discussion. You're welcome to jot
down notes in preparation if you like, but you do not need to turn any of this in.
Essays. ​There will be one midterm and one final essay of 7-8 double-spaced pages. I will provide prompts two
weeks before the essays are due. The essays will be an opportunity to reflect on and synthesize issues raised in the
readings and in our discussion.
Proposal. ​The final assignment will be to prepare a 3-4-page (single-spaced) research proposal on a topic
connected with the themes of the course. This may be a proposal related to your MA or dissertation research, or
it may be a proposal you develop specifically for this course. The aim will be to engage carefully and deeply with
the theory and methods we have encountered in the course. The proposal will include three sections:
              ●    The first spelling out your research question, hypothesis, and the significance of your
                   contribution (~ 1 page)
              ●    The second devoted to engaging with the sociolinguistic theory you will be building on and
                   advancing. (~ 1 page)
              ●    And the last will outline the methods you will use to test your hypothesis and explore your
                   research question. (~2 pages)
Proposals will be pre-circulated to class participants and discussed in our final meeting during finals week. I will
provide more details around the tenth week of class.
Grading​. Grades will be based on the midterm and final essays (25% each), proposal (25%), and participation in
class discussions (25%).
