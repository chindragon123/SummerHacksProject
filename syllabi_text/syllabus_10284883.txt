Course Overview
The Capstone is focused on learning how to create 3D games using industry standard tools
and best practices in medium-size interdisciplinary teams. This is an authentic,
experiential learning course, and not your typical lecture and testing course. The
learning happens by doing. Topics covered are game ideation, prototyping, testing, and
iterating. Teams use the agile/scrum development methodology as the framework for
completing their games. Learning team dynamics, as well as development best practices, is
core for creating games and the class. In addition, there is an emphasis on connecting the
work performed in class to that being done in industry. Industry partners playtest games
and provide feedback, and the class presents their post-mortems within a game studio.
Students become prepared to find the appropriate position and ability to work within a
studio environment. In the end, teams make awesome games to show prospective
employers and the public!
This course has the Independent Inquiry flag.

Attendance and participation in all classes is expected, but if you cannot make it to class,
there are consequences. Being consistently late to class is not cool and it will have a
negative impact on your grade. Also, assignments are due at the beginning of class and
there are consequences for turning in assignments after this time.

Computer Policy
Your computer is to stay closed unless otherwise indicated by the professor. Mobile phones
are not to be used in class. If there is an emergency, please leave the class.
Professionalism
This course is a preparation for employment in a studio. Therefore we expect you to act in
class as you would in the workplace. While studios are often informal, they still require
everyone to be respectful of others. Furthermore, attendance both for the class and when
your team meets are critical. How your teammates view the quality and quantity of your
work, as well as your team skills are important. Finally, how much work you produced, as
recorded in the agile development software, will be considered.

alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside. Further information
regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at:

Harassment Reporting Requirements
 Senate Bill 212 (SB 212), which goes into effect as of January 1, 2020, is a Texas State Law that requires all employees
(both faculty and staff) at a public or private post-secondary institution to promptly report any knowledge of any
incidents of sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence, or stalking “committed by or against a person who
was a student enrolled at or an employee of the institution at the time of the incident". Please note that both the
instructor and the TA for this class are mandatory reporters and MUST share with the Title IX office any
information about sexual harassment/assault shared with us by a student whether in-person or as part of a journal
or other class assignment. Note that a report to the Title IX office does not obligate a victim to take any action, but
this type of information CANNOT be kept strictly confidential except when shared with designated confidential
employees. A confidential employee is someone a student can go to and talk about a Title IX matter without
triggering that employee to have to report the situation to have it automatically investigated. A list of confidential
employees is available on the Title IX website.
