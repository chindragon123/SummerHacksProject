Professor:        Tomas Rodriguez, P.E., CFM | ​tomasito@utexas.edu​ | ECJ 5.434 (by appt.)

What are the goals of this course?
ARE 217 will improve your skill in visual communication and introduce you to different types of drawings, such as
orthographic projections, axonometric views, and 1, 2, and 3-point perspectives. Some of you may have taken
drafting in high school and are familiar with measured drawings such as plans and elevations, while for others it
may be your first exposure to this drawing type. The structure of the course is intended to foster collaboration,
where more experienced students can be a resource for those new to the concepts covered in class.
In addition to learning traditional “engineering” types of drawings, in this course students will also be introduced
to creating, manipulating and editing digital images using popular graphics software. Broadening your skillset to
include these techniques shouldl prove useful throughout both your course of study and your future career in
engineering.
What will you learn?
The course will prepare students for the Architectural Engineering design sequence by using Computer Aided
Drafting and Design (CADD) tools such as AutoCAD, Revit, and Sketchup. AutoCAD is the industry standard
CADD software application, Sketchup provides an introduction to 3D modeling concepts, and Revit will introduce
you to Building Information Modeling (BIM). Students will also have the opportunity to use the traditional graphics
software programs Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to explore how they can be applied to engineering. Finally,
you will also learn techniques for drawing by hand in two and three dimensions. The instructor firmly believes
that hand drawing is important in developing your ability to think and design spatially. As you gain more
experience, the tool you choose to use to produce a design is secondary to what you can conceptualize.

Course Requirements & Information
The course will generally have a lecture session on the second class day of the week and a lab section on the
first class day of the following week. Lecture and lab are both from 6:00-9:00 pm in ECJ 3.106 (unless stated
otherwise for a specific lecture). You will occasionally have lectures during lab sections as well.
Exams
There are no scheduled midterm or final examinations for this course.
Prerequisites
ARE 102 Introduction to Architectural Engineering
Text & Supplies
There are no required texts for this course. Handouts will be posted on Canvas throughout the semester. We
suggest that you purchase Francis Ching’s ​Building Construction Illustrated (​ 5th edition), as it is required for
future courses in the ARE design sequence.
The following supplies are required:
                            ●   A USB Flash Drive for file backups (optional)
                            ●   Sketch book
                            ●   B or 2B pencils, eraser and ruler
                            ●   Architectural and Engineering scales
Evaluation
An evaluation of the course and instructor will be conducted at the end of the semester using the approved UT
Course/Instructor evaluation forms.
Dishonesty
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the
individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced.       For    further     information,     visit  the     Student     Judicial    Services    web     site.

Important Note-Students with Disabilities
The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement,

Grading
The +/- grading system will be used for calculation of final grades.
Attendance & Participation (15%)
Since this is a two-credit hour course scheduled for six hours of instruction, it is my intention that you spend little
if any time outside of class and lab to complete the assignments. However, I do expect you to attend lectures
and labs. Attendance is worth 15% of your final grade; attendance will be taken and each unexcused absence
from class or lab will subtract 10% from your attendance grade (i.e. 1.5 points off your overall class grade). If you
have to miss a class for personal reasons or have a conflict such as an evening exam, you ​must ​notify the
instructor (me) and the TA ​via email or through the messaging system​ on Canvas as soon as possible.
Quizzes (15%)
You will have quizzes in the lab section to reinforce key concepts from the lectures.
Classroom Assignments (35%)
Throughout the semester you will be given an assignment in lecture, then have the remainder of lecture plus
three hours of lab the following week to work on it. Assignments will be due ​at the end of lab​, and should be
turned in even if not 100% complete. It is important that you keep up, because the next lecture will bring a new
concept and new assignment. Most will be submitted electronically via Canvas, but occasionally we may ask that
you print an assignment and submit it in paper form. Assignments turned in late will be docked two letter grades
per week. Any problems, personal or otherwise, affecting grades should be brought to the instructor's attention
as soon as possible.
Final Project (35%)
Much of the second half of the semester will be spent working on the design of a two-story office building. Each
student will design the architectural layout, structural layout, mechanical layout, and site layout for a building. On
the last class day, students will give a presentation of their building designs.
Class Drop Policy
Undergraduate Students:
From the 1st through the 12th class day, an undergraduate student can drop a course via the web and receive a
refund, if eligible. From the 13th through the university’s academic drop deadline, a student may Q drop a course
with approval from the Dean, and departmental advisor.
Graduate Students:
From the 1st through the 4th class day, graduate students can drop a course via the web and receive a refund.
During the 5th through 12th class day, graduate students must initiate drops in the department that offers the
course and receive a refund. After the 12th class day, no refund is given. No class can be added after the 12th
class day. From the 13th through the 20th class day, an automatic Q is assigned with approval from the
Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. From the 21st class day through the last class day, graduate students
can drop a class with permission from the instructor, Graduate Advisor, and the Graduate Dean. Students with
20-hr/week GRA/TA appointment or a fellowship may not drop below 9 hours.
