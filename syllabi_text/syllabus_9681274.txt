DESCRIPTION
Has the U.S. criminal legal system reached a turning point? After four decades of precipitous
growth, the criminal legal system is facing challenges from groups across the political spectrum.
Talk about “criminal justice reform” is everywhere. But what, exactly, is this system? How does
it work, what role does it play in U.S. society, and what does it take to change it? This course
will provide tools to answer these questions by examining the criminal legal process from the
making of criminal law to policing, pretrial detention, prosecution, and imprisonment or other
penalties. At each stage, we will consider implications for racial and economic inequality and
the impacts of reforms past and present. We will apply sociological theory throughout to
illuminate the social forces shaping contemporary state punishment.
REQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS
Course readings are all posted on Canvas.
You will need a writing utensil and paper for taking notes.
ASSIGNMENTS
Grading:
                                                                                                 1


Reading responses: 25%
In-class written assignments: 25%
Presentations: 20%
Research project: 30%
Reading responses and in-class assignments will be short responses to the readings based on
prompts that I will assign as we go. I have assigned relatively few pages of reading for each day
to give you time to read those pages carefully and think them over before class. I have also
listed and uploaded a range of optional readings, in case you have an interest in learning more
about any of these topics or would like to consider making it the focus of your final research
proposal.
Final Writing Assignment will be a research proposal on a topic related to U.S. state
punishment. I will hand out detailed instructions during the first week on how to approach the
project.
OTHER NOTES
Attendance Policy: I understand that things come up and people get sick. I drop two of the in-
class activity grades for each person, so you can miss two classes without affecting your grade.
Course information builds on itself, though, so if you do need to miss I recommend that you ask
someone else in the class to take notes to share with you.
Writing: On matters related to all aspects of writing, including the policy on plagiarism, please
consult the Undergraduate Writing Center, where you can also get individualized assistance
with your essays. http://www.uwc.utexas.edu/.
Disabilities: Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations
from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with
disabilities (512-471-6259). If you have an accommodation, please let me know as soon as you
can so that I can ensure that it is met.
Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If you will miss an
examination, work assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day,
you will be given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after
the absence. It is the policy of The University of Texas at Austin that you must notify each of
your instructors at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be
absent to observe a religious holy day.
Food: If you need to eat during class, please just be thoughtful about the food you bring. It’s
important not to create distractions for other students in the class or to leave a mess for the
custodial staff.
                                                                                                  2


Electronics: You may bring laptops or iPads to class if you prefer to take notes in Word
documents or to refer to electronic copies of the reading rather than printing it. Again, though,
please be thoughtful about other students in the class. If your screen is visible to others, it will
be distracting to them if you do anything other than take notes. We will use Smartphones
periodically for flash research projects in class, but otherwise they should not be necessary and
generally create a distraction, so please plan to keep those stowed away unless we’re using
them as a group.
Weekly Feedback: Every Friday, I’ll administer a brief anonymous survey to gather your
feedback on the week’s classes so that I can adjust my teaching accordingly. Feedback is also
welcomed at any time in any format!
Midterm Seminar Evaluation: Halfway through the term, I will conduct a general anonymous
course evaluation. I also use that feedback to make adjustments and changes.
