                                   Building Matters
We often learn things in unexpected ways. Something spins us around in our tracks,
and we suddenly see an avenue that was hidden before. Our axis is tilted, and we
right ourselves in a new way. When conditions arise for the possibility of a new
path, some observations have a heightened ability to seize that moment and point the
way. Building Matters poses the proposition that the artifact of building possesses
intrinsic meaning and value, not reduceable to a text in its conception. This course
aims to mine those material, physical qualities so as to rescue them from illustration;
to present a fresh orientation and an avenue for design.
The course begins with a collection of artifacts, continues with texts and built works,
and aims at generating a critical dialogue within the class. Analytical and critical
skills are developed via discussion, concise writing venues and a final project.
Writing assignments will be short, trenchant responses to the specific artifacts, texts
and buildings, and is expected to be a response to the material put forth, not
explanations of any given artifact. These responses are intended to generate
conversation in class, and participation in this critical dialogue is expected. A final
presentation by each member of the class (or in teams) that expands on each
individual’s interest will take place over the last classes of the semester. In this final
exercise, students will identify a set of physical characteristics and explore their
presence in the built environment. Intended as a provocation rather than a response,
it is expected that this final exercise will require more effort than the previous
weeks’ writings.
The objective of this course is not only to expose students to a relevant body of
writing and built work, but to also develop skills in relating critical investigations to
their physical embodiment. The intention of the course is to afford the framework by
which students might begin to position their own architectural ambitions.
Particular attention will be paid to the realm of material manifestation as a critical
juncture in the formulation of architecture. In the concern for the materials of
building and the manners of construction the architect commits speculation to action:
attempts to convert intention into palpable reality. It is here that architecture is most
fully and deliberately engaged with the world and here that architecture initiates the
world's response in turn. It seems clear, however, from even casual observation that
while this subject matter may be vital it is oftentimes treated as a marginal concern.
This course begins with the assumption that this denial of Architecture's material
potential seriously undermines architecture's value in society and raises fundamental
questions about the legitimacy of our profession more generally. Students will
explore these concerns through their responses and class dialogue.

Course Grading
Establishing grades for projects of a creative nature is a more complex matter than
grading in other academic areas. While each project contains certain quantifiable
elements by which it may be evaluated, a significant portion of each grade is derived
from a broader, more subjective set of issues. The criteria for establishing a grade is as
follows, and plus/minus grades will be assigned:
A Outstanding work
Assignments are complete at all levels and surpass the expectations for Advanced
Seminar work. Participation in critical dialogue in class is consistent, pertinent and
engages the larger discussions.
B Good work
Assignments complete at all levels and student is a regular participant in class dialogue /
conversation.
C Average work
Not all assignments are complete and/or well done. Not a significant part of the class
discussion.
D Not very good work
Not all assignments are complete and/or well done and some of the requested
components of the assignments are missing. Class participation is inadequate
F Unacceptable work
Note that this grade will be assigned when a student has missed an extended amount of
class-time (more than three classes) without notifying the instructor or the School of
Architecture.
X Excused incomplete
Can be given only for legitimate reasons of illness or family emergency. Simply not
completing the work on time is not an adequate cause for assigning this symbol. It may
only be used after consultation with the instructor or the Associate Dean, and with an
agreement as to a new completion date.


Attendance
Punctual and regular attendance is essential. Students with three unexcused absences
during the term, or two consecutive unexcused absences, may not receive a passing grade.
Disabilities
Please notify your instructor of any adaptation you may require to accommodate a
specific physical need. Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement Services
for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259. Specialized services are also found via the web
at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd/.
Recommendations
I am happy to write recommendations for students with at least two weeks’ notice and
who have received a grade of ‘B+’ or higher.
