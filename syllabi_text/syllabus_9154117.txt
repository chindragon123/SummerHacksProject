Making Africa:
At the Blanton Museum of the University of Texas, an unprecedented and comprehensive
exhibition of African art, titled “Making Africa: A Continent of Contemporary Art,” will open
from October 2018 to January 2019. This course uses the exhibition as its laboratory to examine
the social and cultural contexts within which people make and use artistic images in Africa.
Students will explore historical, contemporary, and diasporic aspects of African art, as part of a
more massive expressive complex that includes music, dance, literature, and
cinematography. Within a curatorial context of the Blanton Museum exhibition, the course will
present the works of major artists, art groups, ethnicities, and communities, as a lively dialog
between the creative imaginations of those who make the objects, and the philosophical insight
of the audiences.
