                                                         Academic honesty. I expect that all activities
                     Make                                performed in this class conform to a standard of
                sure you are                             personal integrity and honesty. I will ask each student:
           reading each section
                carefully and                            (1) to add the following statement to all individually
               understand all                            completed work -- “I have neither given nor received

                                                         dishonesty and to report any such incidents to the
                                                         Office of the Dean of Students.
Course-Related Accommodations. I have tried to design this class using the principle of universal
design whereby most elements of the course are designed to accommodate a wide range of student
needs. However, I am prepared and quite willing to accommodate any special needs that a student
might have and for which I have not taken into consideration in the design of the course. I will
comply completely and without reservation to any official directives provided by the Services for
Students with Disabilities Office (www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd). I also encourage you to meet
with me if you have any learning-related needs about which I should be aware.
Religious Considerations. Policy for absences due to religious holy days is set in the Texas Education
Code. The code states that a student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other project
due to the observance of a religious holy day must be given an opportunity to complete the work
missed within a reasonable time after the absence, provided he or she has properly notified each
instructor. It is the policy of The University of Texas at Austin that the student must notify each
instructor at least 14 days prior to the classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent. For religious
holidays that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice should be given on the first day
of the semester. The student may not be penalized for these absences, but the instructor may
appropriately respond if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed assignment or
examination within a reasonable time after the excused absence.
CARE Counseling. CARE is a program through the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center. It is
common to need support when dealing with feelings and problems that seem beyond your control.
CARE Counselors are available to help with a variety of issues that may serve as a barrier to your
academic success.
Your CARE Counselor in the College of Education is Danie White, LPC, LMFT. Her office is in
the George I. Sanchez Building, SZB 212E. To schedule an appointment, call 512-232-6862 and ask
to schedule a CARE appointment. If you leave a voice mail, please include your name, EID, and
contact number. Walk-in hours are also available on Tuesdays and Fridays from 1 – 2 PM. You will
check-in at the College of Education’s Student Division in SZB 216, and they will let Danie know
you’re waiting.

Assistive & Instructional Technology (AIT) Lab Visitation. Site visits to the AIT Lab in
SZB 518e are required to better acquaint students in ALD 322 with the use of assistive
technology (AT) across a number of settings in which individuals with special needs
work, learn, and live. Specific information about this assignment is provided in the “AIT
Lab Orientation Assignment Information” guidelines that are located in the AIT Lab
module on Canvas.
You should collect information that is requested on the “Site Visit Form” – use this form to take
notes when you are doing the visit – this form is also found in the module. After you complete your
visit and have word-processed your notes, you should upload the Site Visit Form via Canvas (AIT
Lab module). This course requirement will be evaluated on the following criteria:
            (a) completing the site visit, as verified by the sign-in sheet given to me by the AT lab
                staff at the end of the term;
            (b) completing the AIT lab evaluation; and
            (c) submitting a completed report that reflects thoroughness and effort.
                 *Form must be typed and submitted

NOTE#2: Every 2 comments to a post by another student is worth 1 point.
               *Must be enough to show you engaged with post.

The Discussion page will open up on 8/28 and will close out on 12/4.


Grade of incomplete. The grade of "Incomplete" will be granted only if a student has
completed 75% of the course. This grade designation will result from a request from a
student based on extraordinary personal or academic reasons, or by me, when deemed
necessary. A due date for completing the course will be negotiated by the student and the
instructor. If the course is not completed by the agreed upon due date, the grade
corresponding to the number of points already earned will be submitted or will
automatically convert to a grade of “F” by the university system.

     Weighting and Grade                        There are 250 points possible for the
                                              course. The grade you earn for this course
         Determination:                    depends on the TOTAL number of points you earn
                                            throughout the term. The point values for each

Class Particiapation        Come to class ready to have fun and learn. I want this
                            course to be meaningful and enjoyable. I want
                            students to feel comfortable sharing thoughts and
                            comments and being open about perceptions and
                            misconceptions they hold towards individuals with
                            differences.

Course Protocol/ Guidelines I am asking you to honor the following requests:
                                *respect other class members & my guests
                                *ask questions during class
                                *let me know if there are environmental needs/problems
                                *let me know in advance -- if you are going to miss class
                                    or have to leave class early
Phone use in class          In all likelihood, there will NEVER be a need to use your
                            smartphone in class. As a result, please place your iPhones,
                            Androids, or other devices in the “silent” mode.
Computer use in class       You will NEED to bring your laptop or tablet to class.
                            However, I would ask that you NOT use your computer for
                            non-class-related purposes.
                            NB: I may designate “digital-free times” when EVERYONE
                            must close his/her computer, etc.


In Class Behavior      I will KNOW who you are and will be cognizant of your in-class
                       behavior – so, if I feel that there is a problem with in-class behavior
                       (e.g., behavior that interferes with the learning of others and actually
                       your own (e.g., excessive chatting; excessive non-class-related digital use
                       -- constantly looking at your computer but no notetaking), you are
                       likely to HEAR from me privately. However, I encourage students to
                       speak directly to one another about any problem that arise.
Emergency Evacuations  In light of an emergency, please familiarize yourself with all exit doors
                       of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the
                       nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
                       building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform Katie
                       in writing during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation,
                       follow my instruction. Do not re-enter a building unless given
                       instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University
                       of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
Plagiarism             UT Senate: “if you use words or ideas that are not your own you must
                       cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism.”
                       I am becoming increasing aware of this problem ... so, I strongly
                       recommend that you comply with issue of scholarly integrity.
Syllabus               A syllabus establishes a “working relationship” between the student and
                       the course instructor. Participation in this course indicates your
                       acceptance of its content, requirements, and policies. Please review this
                       syllabus in detail as soon as possible (and click the “Accept” button!).
Supports for students  UT provides a number of support services for students. An initial
                       overview of services can be found at the Dean of Students website
                       (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu). Please see me if you have any
                       questions or concerns.
Withdrawal from course If you believe that the purpose, goals, policies, requirements, or some
                       other aspect of this course does not meet your interests, needs, or
                       expectations, you should drop the class by the drop/add deadline. Note
                       that other sections (and instructors) of ALD 322 are available this term
                       at UT, and, given that variations in policies and requirements do exist
                       across sections, you may want to explore these other options.
                       If you do decide to drop ALD 322, I wish you the best.
