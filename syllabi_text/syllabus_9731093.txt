Course Description
In this class students are offered a “hands-on” opportunity to work with a real client, while developing a
campaign which holds the potential of influencing many. Taking this class provides you with an
opportunity to support social change and to reshape the consciousness of people. ADV 373 or PR 377
combines all the materials and courses you have learned in the program and manifests it into practice.
This is your chance to implement your knowledge into one holistic and unified campaign. Furthermore,
we will work on how to match various variables and marketing concepts such as the product, the
consumer, media profiles, research, planning and the actual execution of a campaign, into one macro
understanding while using the StoryScaping method and understanding the soul of your client’s business.
In this class, students work as advertising teams.
Overarching Goals and Objectives
     1) The ability to be independent and creative with your work.
     2) The ability to work as a team member.
     3) The ability to sense the core of your client and their business from within and only
         then apply your communication knowledge and skills.
     4) The ability to develop holistic point of view of a communication campaign.
     5) Practice and master your communication and design skills.
Teaching Methods and structure
It is important to note that this class requires from you, the students, a great deal of
independence. The course is built in a way that enables “real life” interactions with your client; a
realistic opportunity for you to practice your skills.
                                                                                                    1


Throughout the course of the semester you will be working closely with the instructor via team
consultations and guidance. An emphasis will be put on raising students’ awareness by helping
them to connect between heart and mind in their work.

Due to the dynamic nature of the class and the possibility of guest speakers’ participation,
readings and the actual course outline are subject to change. Students will be held
accountable for any changed reading material. In the event changes do occur, reading
assignments will be posted on Canvas prior to each class. It is the students’ responsibility to
check Canvas regularly and before each class.
Assignments
The following section provides a brief summary of the course assignments; the instructor will
provide further explanations during the course of the semester.
    1) The Final Campaign (Team Project): students will work with a real client throughout
       the semester. The client will first present the case in class; then, each team will work on
       developing an overall communication campaign. Consultations with the instructor will be
       provided throughout the course of the semester. Finally, each team will pitch to the client
       and a winning team will be selected! (The project is comprised of a book plan + a pitch)
    2) Campaign Presentation – Phase 1 (Team Project): teams will present their perception
       of the client and the brand: what is the soul of the brand? What is the purpose and the
       why of the brand? What is the problem? Who is the target audience? SWOT?
    3) Campaign Presentation – Phase 2 (Team Project): teams will present the second phase
       of their campaign, based on the STORYSCAPING model. This phase focuses on the
       planning and strategy side. It is your time to think, research, understand the big strategic
       picture of the campaign. The main focus: create the most creative organizing idea!!!!
    4) Campaign Presentation – Phase 3 (Team Project): teams will present the third phase
       of their campaign: the execution phase. Emanating directly from the first and second
       phases of the campaign, teams will actually showcase their communication work, plan
       and design (this is your chance to present ads, events, viral movies, social media, new
       and creative communication ideas, etc’; all in direct conjunction with your client and its
       target audience).
    5) Book Chapter Presentations (Team Project): each team will present one chapter from
       the StoryScaping book. Presentations should be clear and well presented.
                                                                                                    2


    6) Attendance: students are required to attend and participate in class. The Agency-Pitch
        assignment is also included in this category. Every student is required to launch a 3
        minutes’ pitch in the beginning of the semester describing their vision for their
        advertising/communication agency.

The following percentage breakdown will constitute your final grade. Final grades will be made

Religious Holy Days Observance Policy
                                                                                                7


The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student
from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of
a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused
under this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an
examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable
time after the absence. A student who misses classes or other required activities, including
examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in
advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an
assignment within a reasonable time after the
absence.http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi03-04/ch4/ch4g.html#attendance
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning
process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and
submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and
must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and
readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University. For more information on scholastic dishonesty,
please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site at http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/.

The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations
for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
