Purpose: To understand modern Japan in historical context.
Overview: This is an introductory survey of modern Japanese history, covering 1850 to 1950. There are no
prerequisites. Topics include a brief survey of traditional Japanese society and politics; the fall of the
shogunate and the Meiji Restoration; industrialization and economic development; the rise of political
parties; militarism and World War II; the American occupation and postwar recovery. Although the
emphasis will be on major political events and institutional developments, we will trace social and cultural
currents through literature, including dramas and novels.
Readings: The following books are available at the bookstore.


Gordon, Origins of Modern Japan, ISBN 9780190920555. Earlier editions are similar.
Tanizaki Junichirō, Naomi, ISBN: 9780375724749. Other editions are fine.
Cook, Japan at War, ISBN 9781565840393
Grading: There will be three in-class quizzes (15% each): February 18, March 24, and April 21. There will
also be two take-home exams: a midterm (distributed on March 26 and due on March 31) (20%) and a final
(distributed on May 7 and due on May 12) (25%). Both these exams should be roughly 1500 words and
fully documented with citations (Chicago Manual of Style )and a bibliography. Class participation is 10%
or your grade. Please come to class prepared to disucss the readings.
Submit your take-home exams via Canvas. Please use .doc or .docx formats.
Extra credit: Finding a bad link or typo in my course materials is worth 0.25 points up to a total of 2.5
points. Let me know via Canvas.
Pronunciation: Vowels in Japanese are pronounced as in Italian. Hence uomo, pasta, prego and bambino
should get you through most words. Alternately,
                                                a as in father
                                              e as in et cetera
                                                 i as in beet
                                                 o as in note
                                                 u as in boot
Vowels with macrons are lengthened, but otherwise remain unchanged. This is an important distinction:
shojo means virgin while shoojo (shōjo) means little girl, and shoojoo (shōjō) means, depending on
context, the symptoms of a disease or an orangutan. Also important is the distinction between "adviser" or
komon and rectum or koomon (kōmon).
Japanese family names come first. Thus, Itō Hirobumi is Mr. Itō, not Mr. Hirobumi.
Romanized Japanese follows standard capitalization rules. Capitalize only proper nouns. Do not arbitrarily
capitalize "Samurai," or "Emperor." Japanese nouns do not have a plural. Therefore, one samurai, two
samurai, three samurai, four. Like deer. Samurais, Samurim, Samurae are all wrong.
