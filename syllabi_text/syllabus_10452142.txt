Class Expectations:
        1. Attendance: For people taking synchronous lectures, attendance will be taken. For
those taking the class asynchronously, use of the course recordings will be monitored.
        2. Stay up to date: Summer classes are INTENSE. Be sure to keep up on the relevant
textbook chapters and articles posted in Canvas, which will require near-nightly reading. Lecture
outlines will be provided in Canvas.
        Experts advise that students spend 2-3 hours studying out-of-class, per hour of in-class
time, in order to earn a passing grade. This means that since we are in class 7.5 hours a week, an
additional 15-22.5 hours should be spent reading & studying Psychology of Language EACH
week.
        3. Please keep instructor apprised of any extenuating circumstances before they interfere
with your work. I am sympathetic if I know you’re trying to fulfill your responsibilities.
        4. University of Texas Honor Code: The core values of The University of Texas at
Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility.
Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty,
trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
        No Plagiarism in Any Form: Students are expected to turn in their own work. Plagiarism
or scholastic dishonesty in any form will result in disciplinary penalties, including possible failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University (Section 3.22, Chapter IV, Rules and Regulations
of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System; www.utesystem.edu/bor/tocrrr.htm).
Plagiarism includes all of the following:
        a. Copying an answer from a classmate or other source during an exam.
        b. Borrowing or copying part of another person’s paper during out-of-class assignments.
        c. Citing an author’s or researchers’ IDEAS, paper organization, exact wording, or
        graphs/figures without giving that person proper credit through an APA-style citation or
        footnote.
        d. Borrowing from, or using outright, papers obtained on-line or through other
        sources which I myself have not written or supplied the background research.
