Course Description:
This Course is designed as an introductory course in Chinese politics primarily for upper-level
undergraduates with a good background in political/social science, but not necessarily any
background on China. The aim of the course is to provide a foundation that will enable the non-
specialist to make informed use of China as a case in more general arguments and give the intended
China specialist a solid footing from which to pursue more in-depth study of particular topics.
This course primarily focuses on domestic politics in post-1978 China. We start the course by
introducing the key institutions and players in order to understand the distribution of political
power in China. We then detail various forms of political participation by different individuals,
which allow us to understand the political logic and consequences of policymaking and selective
policy issues in China. We conclude the course by discussing the political reforms implemented
in the last three decades and contemplating the potentials political development in the future. The
course consists of lectures and in-class discussions in order to enhance students’ learning.
