COURSE OBJECTIVES
        Provide experiences for students to practice and develop their skills as account planners and
         strategic communication problem solvers.
        Improve students’ creativity and skills in conducting research to solve communication problems.
        Refine students’ skills as storytellers in presentations and written reports.
        Work with a variety of clients and agency partners to offer opportunities to develop an account
         planning portfolio to showcase students’ work.
COURSE MATERIALS
There is no course pack or book required for this course. For class lecture/discussion days, students will
be expected to find a relevant trade press article on the topic of the day and post a summary of the article
and their thoughts to Canvas. The articles read by the collective class will then form the foundation for
class discussion. Additional details on this will be provided on the first day of class.
While it is not required reading for the class, I always highly recommend Jon Steel’s Perfect Pitch. It is
an extremely useful book about making presentations and winning new business. It will be useful not
only for the presentations in this class, but for presentations you make in other classes and as you move
forward with your careers.
“IS THIS A THEATER CLASS OR AN ADVERTISING CLASS?”
Yes, it is.
Part of succeeding in any business that requires making pitches and competing for new business is the
ability to present your ideas in an engaging and convincing manner. While the value of your ideas is, of
course, extremely important, so is the manner in which you present those ideas. Presentation grades
throughout this course will reflect the fact that it is not just about how good your ideas are, but how
effectively you can present those ideas.


COURSE GRADING
In general, team members receive the same grades for group exercises and projects. The individual
project offers a chance for personal distinction, since you will have time to work on it and can use
essentially all the resources at your command. Plus/minus grades will be assigned for the final grade.
The assignments for this class include:
        Crash Exercises: These will be short (2-day) exercises conducted in conjunction with clients.
        Team Projects: These longer-term team projects will involve solving communication problems
         for clients.
        Individual Project: The individual project will provide an opportunity to work independently on
         a semester-long project.
        Class Participation: Your participation in class – during in-class exercises and discussions – is
         an important element of completing the class. It is important to show up prepared for class
         discussions, and effective participation includes balancing of quality and quantity.
        Peer Evaluations: Your teammates will evaluate your performance for the class.              Their
         evaluations will be averaged and included as a component of your final grade.

RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS OBSERVANCE POLICY
The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student from
attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious
holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection
may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an
assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence.
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a
religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that
arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
Please notify your instructor of any modification/adaptation you may require to accommodate a
disability-related need. You will be requested to provide documentation to the Dean of Student's Office in
order that the most appropriate accommodations can be determined. Specialized services are available on
campus through Services for Students with Disabilities.
Visit http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/ for more.
POLICY ON SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process.
Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading information to
receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially
the same written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By accepting
this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty
damages both the student's learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a work-career.
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
