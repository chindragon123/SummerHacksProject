Catalog Description A team taught advanced studio course focused on the development of an industry facing project.
Prerequisite(s)     Junior or Senior standing
Course materials    A computer capable of running Unreal Engine. A 3 button mouse.
Objectives &        Students will work in small teams to design and create an interactive (or reactive) multimedia
Assessment          experience based on the Planet Texas 2050 research initiative which is focused on challenges related to
                    climate and population growth in the state of Texas. This multimillion dollar program primarily supports
                    scientific research, the results of which are often difficult for a layperson to understand.
                    Our task is to communicate the key issues and propose fantastical solutions based on science but not
                    yet possible e.g. to save lives in vulnerable populations and solve water shortages, send a swarm of
                    10,000 drones to move water from flood zones to arid agricultural land! The designed experience must
                    tell the story of each solution and strive to connect emotionally with the audience.
                    We will be collaborating with J. E. Johnson’s AET 329J Digital Fabrication course. At mid semester,
                    students from both courses will work together to execute the physical elements of the designs.
                    Each project must meet these requirements:
                          ●     Fit within a 4’ x 4’ x 8’ volume
                          ●     Collapse and store in two 106Q Sterilite bins
                          ●     Arduino for sensing, input, interactivity (kits provided)
                          ●     Video projection
                          ●     Unreal Engine
                    Standard design process (problem, research, synthesis, prototyping, testing, evaluation, revision) will be
                    used throughout the semester. Each step of the process must be documented and presented. Final
                    deliverables include:
                          ●     A high quality finished and functional experience
                          ●     Process documentation in the form of posters and video
                          ●     A 3-5 page project summary
                    By the end of the course, students should be able to:
                          ●     Use design process to create a finished project
                          ●     Discuss goals, process, and results
                    Examples of science storytelling
                          ●     One Strange Rock (available on Disney+)
                          ●     Hack the Museum
                          ●     Sea Rise Lights Installation
                          ●     The Leak in Your Hometown
                          ●     How Virtual Reality Can Help People Better Understand Climate Change

Grading                This course is project based. There will be no exams. Assignments are equally weighted toward 90% of
                       the final class grade. The remaining 10% of the final grade is based on professionalism (see
                       Professionalism below).
                       No late work will be accepted. No incompletes will be given. If you feel you will not be able to complete
                       all work on time, you should ask the instructor for a grade of Q or drop before the deadline for doing so
                       passes.
                       Grading breakdown:
                       Each assignment will be graded according the following rubric:
                       Clarity of solution: Quality of solution: Quality of presentation:
                        40 points              40 points            20 points
                       Final grades will be determined using the following grade distribution. Please note: to ensure fairness,
                       all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will be inclusive of
                       all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not recognize the grade of A+.
                           A = 94-100            B+ = 87-89          C+ = 77-79            D+ = 67-69          F = 0-60
                           A- = 90-93            B = 84-86           C = 74-76             D = 64-66
                                                 B- = 80-83          C- = 70-73            D- = 60-63
Professionalism        Professionalism is expected of all students and includes attending class during scheduled meeting
                       times, communicating clearly, respecting peers, and taking the class seriously. Rolling into class 15
                       minutes late with a starbucks...while texting...on a skateboard...with earbuds blasting Kpop is NOT
                       professional conduct. However, if you catch the flu, get a flat tire, or otherwise cannot attend class,
                       please contact BOTH the instructor and TA, and attach any class work as needed. Please note 3
                       unexcused absences will lower your course grade by one letter per occurrence.
UT Electronic Mail     Electronic mail (e-mail) is a mechanism for official University and instructor communication to students.
Notification Policy    Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with
                       University- and course-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-
                       critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week.
                       It is the responsibility of every student to keep the University and instructor informed of changes in his
                       or her official e-mail address (do so at https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/bio/address_change.WBX).
                       Consequently, e-mail returned to the University with "User Unknown" is not an acceptable excuse for
                       missed communication. Similarly, undeliverable messages returned because of a full inbox or use of a
                       spam filter will be considered delivered without further action required of the University or instructor.
                       (see http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy)
Use of Class Materials The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, and homework
                       assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the class materials is a
                       violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the
                       student. Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the
                       instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic
                       dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action. This includes, among other things,
                       uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or
                       future students.
                       (from https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/coursematerials/Sample+Use+Statement+for+Syllabus)
Religious Holidays     Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code states that a student shall be excused from attending
                       classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day,
                       including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be
                       penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment
                       from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy
                       requires students to notify each of their instructors at least fourteen days prior to the date they will be
                       absent from scheduled classes to observe a religious holy day.
                       (from http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/1555_001.pdf)
Classroom Etiquette    Please observe the following rules during class as a courtesy to fellow students and the instructor.
                       1) Be on time at the beginning of class. If you must come in late at the beginning of class, please enter
                       the room and seat yourself as quietly and unobtrusively as possible.
                       2) Turn off your cell phone’s notification sounds upon entering the classroom. If you forget to do so, and
                       your phone rings, chirps, or vibrates loudly during class, turn it off immediately and discreetly.


                        3) Food is not allowed in class. Drinks in closed containers are permitted but must be kept on the floor or
                        out of sight when not in use.
Academic                The University's Honor Code states that “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide
Integrity               by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” You are expected to maintain
                        absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in scholastic work undertaken at the
                        University. At a minimum, you should complete any assignments, exams, and other scholastic
                        endeavors with the utmost honesty, which requires you to:
                        ● acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts;
                        ● complete your assignments independently unless expressly authorized to seek or obtain assistance in
                           preparing them;
                        ● follow instructions for assignments and exams, and observe the standards of your academic
                           discipline; and
                        ● avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another student.
                        (adapted from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php)
Academic Dishonesty In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines academic dishonesty
                        as including any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved academic advantage, such as:
                        ● Cheating
                        ● Plagiarism
                        ● Unauthorized Collaboration / Collusion
                        ● Falsifying Academic Records
                        ● Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain an extended
                           deadline for an assignment, or even gain an unearned financial benefit)
                        ● Multiple submissions (submitting the same assignment for two courses without authorization)
                        ● Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity
                        (adapted from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php)
                        Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
                        including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
                        (from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_faculty_syllabus.php)
Plagiarism              “Plagiarism” includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining
                        by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source, including words, ideas,
                        illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting that material as
                        one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program course
                        requirement (from Sec. 11-402, http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-
                        c/student-discipline-and-conduct).
Copyright and           Understanding the basic principles of copyright and fair use is of critical importance to designers. Many
Fair Use                of the uses we will make of texts, images, and videos this semester will be covered by the doctrine of
                        fair use. However, as creators, you need to be aware of your own and other copyright holders’ legal
                        rights, and to properly identify and license your own and others’ works. We will discuss these issues
                        during the semester as needed, but when you have questions about whether or when you can
                        appropriate someone else’s work, a useful resource is Georgia K. Harper’s Copyright Crash Course,
                        available at http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/.
Services for Students The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for

Campus Carry As permitted by Texas state law, the concealed carry of handguns by permit holders is generally
             allowed in outdoor areas, as well as buildings and spaces that are accessible to the public. Permit
             holders are allowed to carry in classrooms. It is the responsibility of concealed-carry license holders to
             carry their handguns on or about their person at all times while on campus. “About” the person means
             that a license holder may carry a holstered handgun in a backpack or handbag, but the backpack or
             handbag must be close enough that the license holder can grasp it without materially changing
             position. The holster must completely cover the trigger area and have enough tension to keep the gun
             in place if jostled. A license holder may not carry a partially or wholly visible handgun on campus
             premises or on any university driveway, street, sidewalk or walkway, parking lot, parking garage, or
             other parking area.
             The open carry of handguns is not permitted on campus. Anyone who sees an openly carried gun on
             campus should immediately call 911. (from https://campuscarry.utexas.edu/students)
