COURSE OBJECTIVES, ASSIGNMENTS, EXAMINATIONS, AND GRADING
Objectives or Goals of the Course:
1) To survey the major movements in American art from about 1958 to about 1985. We will look
at the work of selected artists associated with the major trends, including pop art, minimalism,
conceptual art, site-specific art, performance and body art, photorealism, patterning and
decoration, and the varieties of figural art that emerged in the 1980s, including neo-
expressionism, graffiti, narrative, and appropriation.
 2) We will look at these trends from three principal points of view: their relationship to prior
historical developments, their self-stated aims, and their treatment by contemporary critics.
 3) To introduce you to contemporary critical writing.
 Procedure and Grading:
1) This is primarily a lecture course. Lecture outlines will be posted on Canvas. I also post
PowerPoints of lectures on Canvas.
2) Three one-hour examinations:
                 October 2                      33% of final grade
                 November 1                      42% of final grade
                 December 6                     25% of final grade
 3) Preparation for exams. Students will be expected to identify and discuss slides. There will
be both slide identifications (one work) and comparisons (two works). Slides on exams will be
chosen from a list of slides. You will be able to study these slides beforehand on DASe (Digital
Archive Services). This is the link for exam 1:
https://dase.laits.utexas.edu/tag/clarkejr/clarke_american_art_since_1960_exam_1
 4) There will also be essay questions, chosen from questions that you submit; you will choose
one and prepare it at home before the exam.
 5) Papers: Students with an average of B+ or above may elect to write an 8-10 page paper in
lieu of the third hour exam. If you are eligible and wish to write a paper, notify me by November


15 at the latest to get my approval, and follow the instruction sheet posted on Canvas. Papers due
December 6.
 6) Class Attendance. You must sign in each day on an attendance sheet. Three or more
unexcused absences may result in lowering your final grade one letter.
7) Documented Disability Statement
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations
for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for Students with
Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 232-2937 (video phone).
 8) Assigned readings are uploaded to Canvas and most books that the readings come from are
on reserve in the Fine Arts Library.
 9) + Presentations: students may raise their most recent exam grade by a + with a successful 5-
minute visual presentation at the beginning of class. I will give you the details in class.
10) I will assign plus/minus grades.
11) There will be no final exam.
12) University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.
13) Notetaking Suggestion: I strongly suggest that you get an unlined notebook and take class
notes in it, rather than using a laptop or other e-device. Many reliable studies have shown that
hand-written notes are much more effective for learning than even verbatim notes typed into a
laptop. In fact, verbatim notes are the worst! The advantage of an unlined notebook is that you
can makes sketches of the works of art we spend some time on in class, and they make the work
of art your own.
