Text: Essential University Physics, Volume 2 by Richard Wolfson. See attached syllabus for
schedule of lectures.
Overview: This is the second part of a calculus-based technical physics sequence recommended
primarily for premedical students and others in the biomedical sciences. The course covers
optics, electricity and magnetism, and selected topics in modern physics. This course carries the
Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to equip you with
skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments you will regularly
encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial portion
of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
Administrative Issues: Please see Ms. Kelly McCoy, ugaffairs@physics.utexas.edu, 512-471-
8856, Undergraduate Office, RLM 5.214.
Course Pre- and Co-Requisites: Physics 317K and 117M with a grade of at least C-; and credit
with a grade of at least C- or registration in Physics 117N.
Grading: Course grades will be calculated based on the weighted sum of the following:
Homework – 25%, Midterm Exams – 45%, and Final Exam – 30%. Course grades will be
determined by a class curve at the end of the semester and no prescribed cutoff values should be
assumed.
Quest: This course makes use of the web-based Quest content delivery and homework server
system maintained by the College of Natural Sciences. This service will require each student to
pay a $30 charge per course and $60 for two or more courses per semester for its use. This
charge goes toward the maintenance and operation of the resource. Please go to
http://quest.cns.utexas.edu to log in to the Quest system for this class. At some point during the
second or third week, when you log into Quest you will be asked to pay via credit card on a
secure payment site. Quest provides mandatory instructional material for this course, just as is
your textbook, etc. For payment questions, email quest.billing@cns.utexas.edu.
Homework: You will download the homework and submit your answers online at
https://quest.cns.utexas.edu. Solutions will be available online right after the due time. The


lowest two homework grades will be dropped in calculation of the course grade. Read the
students’ documentation at https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/questla/Students. You are
encouraged to work together on the homework. You must, however, submit your own work for
credit.
Midterm Exams and Final Exam: There will be two midterm exams during class time on
Monday July 29 and Friday August 9. The final exam is cumulative and mandatory and will be
held from 9 am to noon on Monday August 19, as scheduled by the Registrar’s Office. No early
final exam will be given. The midterm exams and final exam will be closed book and notes. A
formula sheet will be provided to you and calculators may be used for numerical calculations
only. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.
Pre-Class Reading and In-Class Activities: Before coming to class you are expected to have
read the relevant materials from the textbook for that day. The lectures will not simply
regurgitate what you have read, rather they will focus on explaining and expanding the concepts
that you may have difficulty understanding, with the help of demonstrations, interactive quiz
questions and example problems.
Important Dates: The last day to drop a course for a possible refund is Thursday July 18. The
last day to change registration to or from the credit/no credit basis is Friday August 2. The last
day to drop the course with approval is Friday August 16.
Special Accommodations: The University of Austin provides upon request appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact
the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY.
