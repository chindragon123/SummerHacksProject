                                     I. Homework Assignment Policy
1. All homework assignments should be turned in on homework due day as soon as you arrive in class.
   If you write homework during class, that homework assignment will be considered late.
2. Late submission: Only one late homework assignment in each category will be accepted. You will
    receive a zero (0) grade for all the subsequent late homework assignments. No excuses, including the
    case that you forget to bring it to school, will be accepted.
3. If you are absent on the day when a homework assignment is due, that assignment can be turned in on
   the day you return to class without being considered late. If you forget to turn it in on the first day you
   return to class, it will be considered a late homework.
4. Traditional or simplified characters: There are two versions for character writing: traditional and
   simplified versions. The traditional version is used in Taiwan and some overseas communities; the
   simplified version is used in Mainland China. You can only choose one version for writing.
   Characters written in the other version will be counted as mistakes. However, you are required to
   recognize/read both versions, as they both will be used in the tests and quizzes.
                                          II. Homework Assignments
A.   Character Workbook (CWB)
B.   Translation Homework (T Hw)
C.   Listening/Reading Homework (L/R Hw)
D.   Character Homework (C Hw)
A. Character Workbook (CWB): 1 late turn-in with 10% deduction. No drops.
     1. Please tear out assigned pages and hand them in on each due day.
     2. Please always staple your character homework pages together and write your Chinese name
         (when you have one) on the first page of each work before handing them in. Failure to do so will
         result in up to 5 points deduction to your grades.
     3. The grades for your character writing homework this term will be based on the last line you fill
         in. You can use the rest of the lines for personal practice.
B. Translation Homework (T Hw): 1 late turn-in with 10% deduction. No drops.
     1. Students should have the draft ready for Translation Homework Discussion days. You can find
         Translation Homework questions in your Integrated Chinese Workbook. See the table below for
         the pages of each lesson. Failure to show your draft on a homework discussion day will be
         considered a half (0.5) absence.
 L1     L 1.1 (C: p. 17) & L 1.2 (G: pp. 26-27)            L5   L 5.1 (E: pp. 80-81) & L 5.2 (D: p. 88)
 L2     L 2.1 (E: pp. 33-34) & L 2.2 (D: pp. 40-41)        L6   L 6.1 (C: pp. 100-101) & L 6.2 (D: pp. 109-110)

     2. A revised T Hw should be turned in the day after the discussion day, before the class starts. This
         one must be handwritten on the homework sheet provided in Canvas. Please write your Chinese
         name (when you have one) on the first page of each work and always staple your homework
         pages together when using more than one sheet. Submission without following these instructions
         (not write on the designated homework sheet, not stapled, no Chinese name) will result in up to 5
         points deduction to your grades.
                                                         4


   3. If you are absent on the day when a T Hw draft is due, you will receive 1 absence, not 1.5
       absences, and you don’t need to show or e-mail your instructor your draft.
C. Listening/Reading Homework (L/R Hw)
   Ø Please use the appropriate homework answer sheet with instructions, available in Page (6/11) on
       Canvas.

Grammar Practice Draft (Gr. P.)
   Ø Students should complete Grammar Practice sheet (4 questions for each lesson, on Canvas) on
       each Gr. P. Disc day. There is no need to turn this in. However, coming to class without having
       finished the practice will result in a 0.25 absence. If you are absent on the day of the discussion,
       you will incur 1 absence, not 1.25 absences. There is no need to show your instructor anything.
       But you can ask your instructor to check your answers.

                                           Attendance Policy
The following rules are also applied to students who take this class for “pass/fail”.
    1. Each day’s class will consist of two sessions (Class 1 and Class 2) separated by a 15-minute
        break. Being absent from one session is considered one (1) absence. Therefore, if you miss one
        day of class, it would be counted as two (2) absences.
    2. Absence time is counted by the minute. Each accumulated 25 minutes, tardiness and early
        departure included, is considered 1/3 absence.
    3. Note that, coming to class without the Translation Homework (T Hw) draft is counted as half
        (0.5) an absence, and without the Grammar Practice draft is counted as 0.25 absence.
    4. Each student is allowed a maximum of three absences (1.5 class day or 225 minutes) without
        penalty. No excuses need to be given for these absences. Each subsequent absence (or 75
        minutes) will result in a deduction of 0.5 point from your Class Participation score. No excuses
        for these subsequent absences will be accepted.
    5. Six (6) or more absences, the penalty-free ones included, during this term will cause your
        semester grade to be lowered by one full grade (e.g., A or A- will become B).
    6. Twelve (12) absences, the penalty-free ones included, will automatically result in an F grade for
        this course.
                                                       7


                                    Scholastic Dishonesty
1. Receiving answers for homework, exercises, or quizzes/tests from another person, whether
   that person belongs to the current CHI F506 class or not, is considered an act of scholastic
   dishonesty, and will be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students even if there is only
   circumstantial evidence.
2. Students who do not fully disclose their linguistic background in Mandarin Chinese on the
   first class day will be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students for an investigation of
   possible scholastic dishonesty. Any dispute between the instructor and the student on this
   issue will be resolved at the Office of the Dean of Students.
3. Any other forms of cheating will be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students.
                                       Important Notes
1. After each of the tests and quizzes has been graded, all students are strongly encouraged to
   visit the instructor during the office hours to discuss the mistakes. All tests will be kept in
   the department’s office until the end of the following semester. After that, they will be
   destroyed.
2. Throughout the session, the CHI F606 class-related announcements, materials, or
   information will be sent out via e-mails or be posted on Canvas. It is the student’s
   responsibility to make sure that such announcements/materials/ information can be
   received in a timely fashion.
3. Students who must miss a class, a quiz/test or an assignment in order to observe a
   religious holy day will be given the opportunity to complete the missed work within a
   reasonable time after the absence and will not be considered absent for that day. However,
   such a request must be made at least 14 days prior to the religious holy day.
4. All students are urged to turn off their mobile phones or computers during class time, and
   are required to do so during a quiz or test. There will be 5 points deduction from your test
   or quiz score if your phone/watch/computer/iPad and such makes noise during the test
   or quiz.
5. Texting in class is prohibited.
6. As a courtesy, students who must leave the classroom before the class is dismissed should
   ask for permission to do so.
