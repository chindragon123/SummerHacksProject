COURSE DESCRIPTION:
        When Jesus was two years old, he fled to Egypt with his family. He lived in North
Africa as a refugee for many years before returning to Nazareth. His time in Africa marked a
preparation period for the ministry he would eventually lead as an adult. Many of his
followers and early leaders of the church would also find themselves in this region as they
developed organized Christianity. And yet, we often hear nothing about Jesus’s time in
Africa. We do not often consider the ways Africa served as an important ministerial training
ground or space of philosophical development. Nor do we understand it as a place of
religious thinking and organizing. It is hardly ever thought of as a generative religious space.
Instead, Africa—both historically and in the present moment—is often described as a place
to introduce religious ideas and cultivate subordinate missions.
        Christian missionaries and Islamic leaders made Africa a major site of spiritual
conversion, especially in the 19th century. Not much changed in the 20th century. During this
period, Africa became a place where Christian aid and Muslim almsgiving flourished even as
Africans continued to engage indigenous practices in the face of devastation. Most Africans
rely on some sort of spiritual engagement even though Africa is characterized as place in
great need of moral redemption. Yet, one in four people in Sub-Saharan Africa consider
themselves Christians. Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Ethiopia are among
the top ten countries in the world with the largest Christian population, quickly transforming
Christianity into a non-Western religion. And Islam, Judaism, and indigenous religious
practices loom large in African life. How and why is Africa a generative site of organized
religion even if it is not described in that way? What impact did the early missionary
enterprise have on the development of Christianity in Africa? Which ways did organized
religion support multiple political structures, agents, and strategies from colonialism to
colonial resistance, independent government, and beyond? And lastly, why are these histories
often told from a western perspective even though Judeo-Christian religions such as
Christianity seem to both begin and end in Africa? These four questions will animate our
exploration of Christianity in Africa as well as other religions practiced on the continent.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
        This course has two broad objectives. The first objective is to explore the long
history of Christianity in Africa, while still engaging its relationship to other religious
practices. Simultaneously, it wrestles with the ways African interpretations and religious
expressions of Christianity have not been privileged. The second objective is to arm students
with a set of analytical tools that require them to critically examine sources by
contextualizing historical moments, engaging in close readings, corroborating evidence from
                                                                                                 1


various places, and reading archival silences. These analytical tools, all of which will be
introduced and modeled throughout the semester, are important lenses for gaining an
understanding of African Christianity at various historical moments.

                                    Description of Assignments
Participation & Attendance (Total: 20 points)
         African Studies in a broad sense is very likely unfamiliar and foreign to you even if
you are familiar with the study of religion or history. This means attendance at every class is
among the minimum requirements for success. It will be incredibly difficult for you to do
well in this class if you do not attend the lectures regularly. Each student is expected to
attend class, participate in discussions, and complete all reading and writing assignments by
the deadlines indicated in this syllabus or any written addenda. It is each student’s
responsibility to come to class prepared to discuss the reading for this course. Students are
not allowed to record class interactions unless they have written permission from the
professor. Please arrive to class on time and turn off cell phones and all electronic forums
that do not facility a productive class environment.
                                                                                                  2


         Successful students rely on lecture notes alongside the text to gain understanding.
These students also come to class prepared and ready to actively engage all assigned texts.
This requires reading, watching, listening and reflecting on all the assigned texts (which
might be given in various formats) as well as being prepared to pose relevant questions,
provide comments, and feedback about these texts for each class period. In other words, you
must have an active voice in the class (whether you use your actual voice and or writing). We
will employ various strategies to encourage your participation beyond simply speaking-up in
class. You can always actively ignite and join discussions via the discussion forum on Canvas.
Plan on posing (via email, social media, or in class itself) at least one thoughtful question or
comment at least every two weeks to ensure consistent participation.
         You are welcome to use Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and of course, Canvas as
both formal and productive mediums of discussion as long as you mark your posts #AFR
372G,#RS 360, and #AfricaTeaches. You should also be prepared to share your posts and
tweets with your classmates as well as with me. Your comments in this medium can and will
also be used to evaluate your class participation. However, if the instructor finds that you are
not using these platforms in a course-related manner, social media will be suspended from
classroom use. Keep in mind that social media can be a challenging forum from which to
engage course material given its parameters (e.g. Twitter’s 144 character length for posts,
unclear boundaries between the personal and the academic, or inaccessible private accounts),
so be sure to think deeply and respectfully about each of your posts and ultimately your
desire to even use social media in this course. Use your voice, writing, and if you choose
your social media platform to critically engage in a sustained discussion this semester. The
way you employ these various tools (in terms of your consistency and thoughtfulness) can
greatly impact your understanding of the course material.
         Each student is allowed three unexcused absences during the course of the
semester. Each additional (unexcused) absence will result in a 5-point deduction from your
final grade.
*Absences Due to Athletics or University Activities
Any athlete competing for UT on an NCAA or club level team needs to notify me in the form
of a written letter from university authorities (such as the Athletic Department) prior to the
absence for my consideration.
Quizzes (Total: 20 points)
There will be several quizzes that cover major concepts, definitions, and ideas at various
moments in the semester (most will be unannounced with the exception of the map quiz).
For the map quiz, all students will be expected to be familiar with the cities, towns and
regions, that we will study this semester. The list of all of these categories will be provided
early in the semester to get students acclimated to the geography of Africa. Other quizzes
will reflect concepts and ideas that were presented in previous lectures, readings, and or
other types of information posted on Canvas. The purpose of these quizzes is to hold you
accountable for these ideas and to highlight important aspects of the course that will be
reflected in the midterm examination.
Short Reflection Papers (Total: 30 points)
Students are required to write a total of two short essays throughout the course of the
semester on assigned readings or films.
                                                                                                 3


 These essays MUST:
             (1.) Provide a BRIEF overview of the reading to provide the reader with the
                   intellectual context from which the author is engaged. The synopsis of the
                   reading should work to bring to bare the ideas in the reading that are most
                   relevant to your discussion. In other words, your synopsis should have a
                   pointed focus on the topic you plan to discuss in your response paper and
                   should not merely summarize the reading.
             (2.) Clearly identify and articulate the major argument(s) or narrative of the text
                   you will analyze in the paper. In short, you must define the focus of your
                   paper by making a clear and concise thesis statement that demonstrates your
                   thinking/intellectual vantage point about an idea within the reading.
             (3.) Explain how the text informs, challenges, and/or expands your
                   understanding of the particularities of African religious history by using
                   specific examples and details. You must consider specific ideas within your
                   paper, which will require you to consider specific ideas and cite them in your
                   response paper.
             (4.) Make connections between the text and other course materials (lectures,
                   other readings, documentaries, etc.) You must be clear on the ways this
                   reading is situated in the course conceptually (and this must be demonstrated
                   in your response paper). Gaining a sense of its purpose within this course
                   and the larger field of African religion will allow you to formulate interesting
             conclusions in your response paper.
Essays must be a MINIMUM of 3 pages (and no more than 3.5 pages) in length, typed (in 12-
point font), double-spaced with standard 1” margins. They must also be free of grammatical
errors/typos and use proper citation techniques specific to the discipline of history (Chicago
Manual Style). Please do not use any other form of citation.
Midterm Examination (Total: 30 points)
          There will be a midterm exam part way through the semester. The Midterm will
consist of pair identifications, short answer questions, and two broad conceptual essays. Pair
identifications require the student to both define and link to key terms presented in the course.
Short answer questions provide students with an opportunity to offer an answer to a concrete
set of questions taken from the readings and lectures while broad conceptual essays aim at
giving students an opportunity to think more cumulatively and substantively about a set of
large themes. All your answers to this exam must be entirely of your own making. Working with someone
else on the exam in any way will be interpreted as academic dishonesty and will be reported.
*Please note that portions of this syllabus may change at the discretion of the instructor but
adequate notification will be provided.
