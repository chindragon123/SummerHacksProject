Lectures
Students are encouraged to attend all lectures. However, attendance will not be counted toward the final
grade.
Course description
This is a theoretical class, and rigorous proof will play a central role in both the lectures and the assess-
ments. The overall goal is to achieve a precise logical understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying
calculus, and to learn how to construct valid proofs related to these concepts. When solving the problems
on assessments you will be expected to carefully justify all claims, either by proving them directly or by a
specific citation.

Grade determination
There will be one midterm exam and one final exam, as well as weekly homework. The midterm exam will
be during class time on Thursday, June 28. The date for the final exam will be set by the registrar.
The final grade will be determined by 45% for homework, 20% for the midterm exam and 35% for the
final exam.
Letter grades will be given as follows:
    • 90-100: A
    • 87-90: A-
    • 84-87: B+
    • 78-84: B
    • 75-78: B-
    • 70-75: C+
    • 65-70: C
    • 60-65: C-
    • 50-60: D
    • 0-50: F
The grading scale may be adjusted in students’ favor depending on the results of assessments.
Assessment policy
The homework will be due at the beginning of class on Thursday. The first homework will be due on Thurs-
day, June 12. There will be no homework assigned for the week of the midterm exam. You may discuss the
homework with your classmates, but you must write up your own solutions.
The homework will be posted on Canvas by 2 pm on Thursday. Each homework will be based on mate-
rial presented before the end of Monday’s class in the week it is due. Each student will be allowed one
week-long extension for a homework assignment. Please inform me by email if you would like to use the
extension for a particular week. Otherwise a valid reason will be required for late submissions.
