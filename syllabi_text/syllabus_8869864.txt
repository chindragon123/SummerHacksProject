COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course examines a variety of design elements controlled over live entertainment networks. More
specifically we will be exploring hardware and software components and how they communicate with one
another to execute a variety of designs. The Hog4 lighting console will serve as a key component for both
input and output device throughout the course. Students will learn how to utilize the Hog4 console in both
the traditional and nontraditional workflow. Students will have hands-on training with lighting fixtures from
High End Systems, as well as a variety of projection playback software and hardware. This course will
combine programming techniques, technical research, and design process. By placing system components in
conversation with design practices, students will be able to design and adapt for a variety of performances.
LEARNING OUTCOMES:
By the end of the semester, students should be able to:
• Recognize and analyze system components;
• critically examine communication protocols;
• apply designs and configure networks utilized for live performance;
• effectively participate in a collaborative design process; and
• create and implement an inclusive design
COURSE MATERIALS:
•   8GB maximum USB drive
•   Pencil
•   1 – notebook (small or medium in size, easily accessible for notetaking and may be used during
    quizzes)

If you submit your assignment late it will not be reviewed in class.
All work is due as specified in the assignment listed in canvas. Work not completed prior to the
canvas deadline will be considered late.
Any work turned in late, regardless of the excuse, will result in a grade reduction of one full letter for
each calendar date it is late (an A would become a B and so on).
In summary:
Every assignment has a due date and time.
I do accept work after the due date, however, assignments automatically lose one full letter
grade for every calendar date submitted late and they will not be reviewed in class.
Any work turned in more than 4 calendar days late will receive an automatic F. If you are having difficulty
completing your work on time, please speak to me privately prior to the deadline, so we may discuss a
possible arrangement.
                       All assignments will be graded within 7 days of submission date.
Grading Scheme
A- Represents outstanding participation in all course activities. All assigned work must be completed
on time and with a very high quality of demonstrated skill and technique. There is an evidence of
significant development across all dimensions of learning. The result at this level demonstrates activity
that goes significantly beyond the required course work in one or more areas.
B- Represents excellent participation in all course activities; all assigned work must be completed on
time with consistently high quality in course work. There is an evidence of marked development
across all dimensions of learning.

AET 360C: Entertainment Systems Design / Smith                                         Fall 2018
C- Represents good participation in all course activities; all assigned work completed, with generally
good quality in course work. There is evidence of some development across all dimensions of
learning.
D- Represents uneven participation in all course activities; some gaps in assigned work completed,
with inconsistent quality in course work. The evidence of development across all dimensions of
learning is unclear.
F- Represents minimal participation in all course activities; serious gaps in assigned work completed,
or very low quality in course work. Development evidence is not available.
Please Note: If you are concerned about your grade – check in with us regularly so that we can
determine where you’re at, and what might need to be done to correct any problems. Do not wait
until the end of the semester!
ATTENDANCE:
ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY - Being a professional requires a habit of discipline and rigor.
Professionals in the arts achieve at the highest level when they work with determination and
dedication to detail. Your attention to attendance and lecture information gathering is an important
element of establishing professional standards and practices. The course lectures and discussions will
involve a significant amount of information that will not be available in any other form (textbook,
handouts); therefore, regular attendance is necessary for successful completion of the class.
If you need to miss class for legitimate reasons it is your responsibility to contact me directly with this
information. Sending a message by way of another student of an impending absence does not
constitute a legitimate notification.
For each unexcused absence after your first three, your final grade will be lowered by one letter
grade. Seven unexcused absences constitute an automatic F in the class.
Please be on time for class. If you are more than 5 minutes late for class you will be counted as
tardy. Every two instances you are tardy will be counted as one time absent.
Privacy
What we say about each other’s work during this class should remain in the classroom. It will not be
published in a blog or on any other personal website, tweeted, or posted on social networks. Please
respect each other’s work.
