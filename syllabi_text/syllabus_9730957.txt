          Within the African American intellectual and political tradition, it is artists rather than
philosophers or statesmen who have produced some of the most penetrating insights about American
culture and politics. Beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century however, literary artists have vied
with Black musicians for pride of place. Among this group of literary artists and intellectuals, Ralph
Ellison, James Baldwin, and Toni Morrison are among the most important. The corpus of each contains
first-rate literary works, provocative and erudite literary and cultural criticism, and insightful theoretical
analysis of the perils and possibilities of black life under conditions of American political modernity. In
this course, we will examine the novels and critical essays of these writers as works of cultural criticism,
political theorizing, and political engagement. We shall ask, how do each of these writers conceive the
legacies of slavery, mastery, segregation, and racial terror, and how do each conceive the relationship
between these legacies and Black flourishing? How does each writer conceive the lessons of these
legacy(s) for American democracy as such and contemporary political life in particular? What aesthetic
and rhetorical forms are most adequate to wrestling with these legacies? What is the vocation of the artist
in Black America and America as a whole? And are these conceptions of the intellectual’s vocation
politically relevant for us today?
          The aim of this course will be to facilitate, among students, a substantive intellectual engagement
with these authors’ novels and critical works, and to wrestle with the some of the central intellectual
problems within Black political thought and Cultural criticism.
