Course Objectives
 Gain an understanding of the theory and “language” of taxation.
 Establish a broad understanding of the tax policy framework from which we can make informed decisions as
    voters. Identify tax policy issues suggested by or underlying particular provisions of the tax law.
 Show how taxation affects the economic decisions of multiple parties to a transaction. Build an appreciation
    for the importance of tax considerations in financial transactions.
 Teach sufficient detail about tax laws to provide a basic knowledge for all the students who are future taxpayers
    and the subset of students who become tax advisors. Apply basic tax rules and regulations to compute the
    taxable income and federal income tax liability for individual and corporate taxpayers.
Required Materials
     Principles of Taxation for Business and Investment Planning by Jones and Rhoades-Catanach. I will be
         using the 2019 version with McGraw-Hill Connect. The bookstore is ordering the loose-leaf edition

Note re Research: “What Starts Here Changes the World!” UT is a “Research 1” school. We create knowledge in
addition to educating students. Some semesters I involve students in my research. If you want to see what sorts of
things I work on, go to https://tinyurl.com/zwq2nj3
Grades are based on mastery of the material. We use plus/minus grading for all sections of the course. I expect to
award a few B-‘s and C’s, many B’s, and some B+/A-/A’s with an overall course GPA around 3.3.
I believe that this difficult material often requires repeat exposure to master, and life throws unexpected hurdles.
Thus, I will evaluate your final course grade substituting your final exam percentage score (if better) for worse
midterm scores. For example, if your midterms were 82%, 60% and 72%, and you scored an 80% on the final
exam, I would evaluate your final grade based on 82%, 80% and 80% midterms and 80% final exam.
Because I substitute the final exam for poor midterms, I offer no midterm makeup exams, except for mandatory
UT excused absences (e.g. athletic events). Choose to come or not, as your adult schedule permits. Note that most
students do not do better on the final exam than on their midterms. I recommend that you study hard and take all
exams. Regrade requests for the midterm exams must be submitted to me in writing within 3 business days after
exams are returned in class.
By UT-Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project to
observe a religious holiday, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable
time after the absence.
Description of Requirements
The exams will be a combination of multiple choice questions (which may be conceptual or numeric), short essay
questions, and problems. The comprehensive final exam will be all multiple choice.
One 4-inch x 6-inch notecard full of notes (two-sided front and back) will be allowed for each exam. Use of the
card is optional and not required. I will ask you to hand in your notecard with your exam. I will provide any
present value, depreciation tables, and tax rate information needed to solve the problems on the exam. You will
not be allowed to use your book or any other notes during exams.
An assignment is due for nearly every class—either an exam, a SmartBook assignment on Connect, or a project.
       I have evaluated the Connect LearnSmart materials – they provide great “active learning” tools to engage
          you with the reading material, to help you with conceptual and definitional material, and to increase
          retention of the numerous small details in taxation. Your using these tools outside class will help us spend
          more time in class reinforcing the framework to hang these details on, then on solving more difficult
          problems together.
       The syllabus lists two tax return group projects that conclude with an analytics assignment to compare
          your taxpayer to others nationally. I will test the assignment to deter free-riding.
       Finally, the attached schedule recommends end-of-chapter problems and prior exam questions. Solutions
          will be posted on Canvas, but you should invest effort to work them independently – I adapt many exam
          questions from the assigned homework, prior exams, and from the questions posed by Connect in the
          LearnSmart exercises, so your effort will be rewarded.
Class Participation
Group sharing and problem-solving activity will be an integral component of your in-class experience, although I
do not grade participation explicitly. You contribute to the class learning environment in the following ways:
 helping classmates solve recommended out-of-class problems,
 expressing your opinion in class discussions and volunteering answers to problems worked in class,
 posting questions, solutions, or current events links and summaries to the class web site,
 asking questions during class or posting questions to the class web site. I (and the rest of the class) appreciate
      the student who says “slow down, I’m confused.”

Students with Disabilities
Upon request, the University of Texas at Austin provides appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the
Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259,
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/. Please notify me of any such needs within two weeks of the first
exam.
McCombs Classroom Professionalism Policy
The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs community. Faculty are
expected to be professional and prepared to deliver value for each and every class session. Students are expected
to be professional in all respects.
The Texas MPA classroom experience is enhanced when:
 Students arrive on time.
 Students display their name cards every day. Cold-calling is fair game.
 Students minimize unscheduled personal breaks.
 Students are fully prepared for each class.
 Laptops and other wireless devices are used only for class engagement. Non-class use distracts you and
      your classmates.
 Hold overly specific questions until outside of class, and expect that some of your questions will require
      some research.
 Provide constructive feedback; I consider all suggestions carefully
 Students respect the views and opinions of their colleagues and participate in making sure all views are
      included. See below – I continue to work against implicit bias and appreciate your help too!
Research on classroom bias
By instructors:
Soraya Chemaly, Time, 12 February 2015
“The impact of unconscious teacher bias is long understood and well-documented. This new research
confirms decades of work done by Myra and David Sadker and Karen R. Zittleman. Through thousands of hours
of classroom observations, the Sadkers and Zittleman identified specific ways in which implicit and stereotypical
ideas about gender govern classroom dynamics. They, as others have, found that teachers spend up to two thirds
of their time talking to male students; they also are more likely to interrupt girls but allow boys to talk over them.”
Katherine Taylor, New York Times, 8 September 2013:
“The country’s premier business training ground was trying to solve a seemingly intractable problem. Year after
year, women who had arrived with the same test scores and grades as men fell behind. Attracting and retaining
female professors was a losing battle; from 2006 to 2007, a third of the female junior faculty left.”
By students:
Economist, 23 January 2016
“Teachers could also benefit from a bit more of the scrupulous attention paid on modern campuses to sexual
equality. Earlier analysis by Ben Schmidt of Northeastern University showed the that language used to describe
professors was heavily gender-dependent. Men were more likely than women to be described as ‘intelligent’ or
‘funny’, but less likely to be described as ‘nice’ or ‘mean’.”
Economist, 23 September 2017 – Business School experiment
“…evaluations place female instructors an average of 37 slots below male ones. Students taught by women gave
lower ratings even to teaching materials that were the same for all course instructors… [despite the fact that]
female instructors added the same amount of value to students’ learnings as did male instructors.… the bias was
particularly pronounced in the case of junior instructors.”

Class Web Site and Student Privacy
Password-protected class sites will be available for all accredited courses taught at The University. Syllabi,
handouts, assignments and other resources are types of information that may be available within these sites. Site
activities could include exchanging email, engaging in class discussions and chats, and exchanging files. In
addition, class email rosters will be a component of the sites. Students who do not want their names included in
these electronic class rosters must restrict their directory information in the Office of the Registrar, Main
Building, Room 1. see: http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi02-03/app/appc09/html.
Privacy in Canvas: Information in Canvas is protected by your UTEID login. Please be aware that I will use a
merged Canvas site for all sections of the course that I am teaching this semester. This will allow students in
other sections to see that you are enrolled in the course and send you email from within Canvas. However, they
will not actually learn your email address and no other personal data will be revealed through Canvas. If you
have any concerns, please contact the ITS Help Desk at 475-9400 for help removing your name from view of
other students.
Academic Dishonesty
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both
students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the BBA Program’s Statement
on Scholastic Dishonesty at http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics.aspx. By teaching this course,
I have agreed to observe all faculty responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this class, you
have agreed to observe all student responsibilities described in that document. If the application of the Statement
on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me
for clarification. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty
harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to the Student Judicial Services website at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ to access the official University policies and procedures on scholastic
dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
I owe it to you to set rules that I can enforce, so that you don’t worry that dishonest classmates gain an advantage.
Exams: Each student must complete the exams independently during the designated exam period. Do not refer to
other students’ exam solutions or discuss the exam with other students during the exam period. Do not send text
messages or access prohibited materials during the exam. Students who have taken an exam are prohibited from
discussing the exam with students who have not yet taken the exam. To help deter cheating, there will be multiple
versions of each exam.
Electronic assignments/quizzes and tax return projects: On outside assignments, you may obtain outside help and
work with others, including classmates, former students, finding copies of solutions, etc. Because I permit
collaboration, I do not make outside work a large component of the grade.
Campus Safety
Please note the following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety
and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/:
       Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
         when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
       Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that
         the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
       Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform their instructor in writing during the first week
         of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
       Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The
         University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
       Further information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at:
         www.utexas.edu/emergency.

CAVEAT: This syllabus includes policies and plans for the course that may require adjustment as the
course progresses. The instructor reserves the right to make changes at any time during the semester with
notice to the class.
Reminder: All LearnSmart/Connect assignments are due by 7:30 am on the day assigned.
