Description: This course will examine major religious traditions of Korea, focusing on
history and contemporary practice rather than origins, philosophical systems, or textual
bases. Topics will include shamanism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Christianity, and new
religions, each of which will be considered from a variety of anthropological,
sociological, and historical angles. We will also explore the relation between religion and
politics mostly from the late 19th century to the present. In the process, we shall seek
also to ask a variety of broad empirical and conceptual questions. How have religions in
Korea been understood and used by various parties, and with what consequences? Is
“religion” a universal concept? Can religion help explain political or economic change?
What intersections do religions have with ethics or with transnational imaginaries?
        This course carries the Global Cultures flag.
Readings: I advise you to purchase the following books from the University Coop or
elsewhere. They will also be on 2 hour reserve at PCL.
        Laurel Kendall, Shamans, Nostalgias and the IMF.
        Robert Buswell, The Zen Monastic Experience.
        Nicholas Harkness, Songs of Seoul.
Other readings will be on the Canvas course reserves page. I reserve the right to modify
or reorder readings or assignments if necessary.
Class format, assignments, and grading: Class sessions will consist of a mixture of open
(“Socratic”) discussion, lecture, and group assignments. I will assume that you have
done the reading for a given class session BEFORE that class begins. BRING LOOSE
PAPER TO CLASS, because you may on occasion have in-class writing assignments.
        I will employ +/- grading for this course. In general, A=92 points or greater, A-
=89-91, B+=87-88, B=82-86, and so on down. I round .5 or better up. Assignments will
consist of the following:
        A) Attendance = 5%
                                              1


         B) Participation = 10%.
         C) Five short (1-2 pp., double-spaced 12 pt.) reaction papers = 10% total
         D) First test = 20%
         E) Second test = 20%
         F) Final paper (8-10 pp., double-spaced, 12 pt.) = 25%
         G) A and B class presentations (one each, 5% each) = 10%
Discussion:
A) Attendance: I will sometimes take attendance, and sometimes generate an attendance
grade by collecting in-class writings. I.e., in essence, a “random sampling” method. I
will excuse the occasional absence with prior notice and a good reason (or notice within
12 hours after the fact in the case of last minute issues like car explosions, sudden illness,
etc.), but once we get above about 3 absences for the entire term you and I, or you and I
and your advisor, will need to have a discussion if you expect some of them to be
excused. In any case, no notes will be posted online or elsewhere, given the importance
that I expect discussion to have in our proceedings. If you will be or have been absent,
make your own arrangements in this regard.
B) Participation: In a class as large as I anticipate, it is unfair to base too much on
participation, but I do mean to incentivize you with what I have. Basically, everyone will
start with 6 out of 10 points. Repeated demonstration that you haven’t done the readings,
a lack of engagement even when called upon, etc., will bring you down from here—note
also that truly poor attendance can have spillover effects on your participation score as
well. On the other hand, frequent, consistent, and/or high-quality engagement in class
discussions will bring your total up.
C) Five short reaction papers (2 points each): You should prepare these, and submit them
on Canvas, by the beginning of class on the days indicated—i.e., the 9/12 assignment is
due on 9/10. The questions or topics for the reaction papers are listed on the due dates
(as well as Canvas); they are meant to get you thinking about the readings. You should
back up your position with reference to the day’s readings.
         Grading: full, ¾, half, ¼, or zero credit, depending on the depth of engagement
demonstrated. There is also a hidden “full-plus” grade, for unusually excellent papers,
which still counts for 2 points...but if you get a lot of these, it will cause me to overlook
weaknesses elsewhere on your record.
         These response papers are supposed to help generate discussion, rather than
simply responding to discussion, so in the case of late submissions I will take at least half
off.
D) & E) First and second tests: These will be similar in format to each other, and will
consist of ID or other short-answer (paragraph length) questions touching on key ideas
from the readings to date. About a week before each test, I will give you a review sheet
listing points for review. Note that the second test is given during the term. There is no
scheduled final exam for this course.
F) Final paper: But there is a final paper (8-10 pp.), which will be due to me in the week
after the last class (see below for exact date, location, and time). You will have several
options of topic; I will hand out a list on a date relatively early in the term designated
below. If you don’t like any of them, and have a (good) idea for an independent paper,
                                                2


that is possible too—in this case, you should discuss your potential paper topic with me
by the middle of the term, at the latest (please schedule a meeting and come prepared
beyond the vague idea stage.)
           Note that outside research will not be an expectation for the assigned topics
(though I will not reject it if you want to do it). It may be necessary for some individual
papers, depending on their nature.
G) A and B class presentations: Finally, each student will be required to give one A
presentation and one B presentation over the course of the term. A presentations should
be in the 5-10 minute range (NOT more than that). Please offer an overview of the main
points and arguments of the reading or readings for that day’s class; please do NOT
attempt a full summary. B presentations should be 5 minutes, tops. Please present three
questions arising from the readings for that day’s class as a basis for beginning class
discussion. Open-ended, comparative, or conceptual questions tend to be better than
closed-ended, factual questions.
           We will sign up for presentations in the first few classes. Note that not every
class meeting will have presentation slots.
