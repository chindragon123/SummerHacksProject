COURSE OBJECTIVES
This course is the culmination of your undergraduate engineering education. To be enrolled in this course, you must have
completed all core courses in the BSME degree curriculum, excluding one or more technical area block courses. As part of a
three- or four-member student team, you will apply your engineering skills to a design project, with the guidance and advice
of faculty members. Many of these projects are sponsored by industry, while others are proposed by faculty members. All
projects represent current areas of concern to the sponsors, who frequently implement the students’ design solutions.
A core requirement of this course is application of engineering design methodology to solve the problem. This means that
each student team must follow a systematic approach, employing both engineering analysis and synthesis, throughout the
design project.
ME Program Outcomes:
The faculty of the Department of Mechanical Engineering has established 10 Program Outcomes that define the basic skills
and abilities that each graduate of the department will successfully acquire. Each course in the curriculum is designed to
address one or more of these Program Outcomes. Demonstration of the following outcomes is expected of each student who
successfully completes MEw266K/MEw266P:
1.   Knowledge of and ability to apply engineering and science fundamentals to real problems.
2.   Ability to formulate and solve open-ended problems.
3.   Ability to design mechanical components, systems, and processes.
4.   Ability to set up, conduct and interpret experiments, and to present the results in a professional manner.
5.   Ability to use modern computer tools in mechanical engineering.
6.   Ability to communicate in written, oral and graphical forms.
7.   Ability to work in teams and apply interpersonal skills in engineering contexts.
Course-specific objectives:
Each student who successfully completes this course will demonstrate the ability to:
1.   Work in a team to solve a significant, open-ended engineering problem.
2.   Combine structured design methods and techniques into an appropriate design process.
3.   Apply project management techniques throughout all stages of a design project.
4.   Apply task clarification techniques to identify and clearly state an engineering problem, or apply root cause analysis to
     identify the sources of an engineering or technical problem.
5.   Generate alternative solutions to an engineering problem.
6.   Make engineering decisions using QUANTITATIVE techniques.
7.   Apply appropriate engineering analysis to predict performance and develop details of solutions to engineering problems,
     or develop and perform experiments, analyze the resulting data, and draw correct conclusions about the data Carrying
     out detailed engineering analysis is one of the most important objectives of this course. Note that “tinkering” to get
     a prototype to work without sound engineering predictions does not fulfill this objective.
8.   Communicate engineering information in graphical, oral, and written forms.
In addition, each student must be knowledgeable about:
1.   Engineering professionalism and ethics.
2.   Product and engineering liability.
3.   Safety considerations and obligations for protection of life, health, and property.
4.   Other considerations important to the professional engineer.
COURSE STRUCTURE
1.   Three-hour LECTURES (MEw266K) are presented at selected times throughout the semester to introduce material of
     broad interest and value to students engaged in engineering design projects. Lectures will be held during the first three
     weeks of the semester, the week after the scheduled oral design review, and once before and once after the final
     presentations. All lectures will be either pre-recorded or presented live through Zoom.
2.   Scheduled LABORATORY SECTIONS (MEw266P) meet two times a week for two and a half hours at a time to allow
     teaching assistants to supervise and monitor each project closely.
                                                                 2


      LABORATORY GROUPS include teams of nominally four persons each. Each team receives a different project
      assignment (the team’s stated preferences are considered as much as possible). Student teams schedule regular meeting
      times with their TA during the laboratory time. All TA meetings will be held via Zoom.
3.  ATTENDANCE is required by all students at all scheduled lectures and laboratories.
4.  Each team is required to have a FACULTY ADVISOR. The team is expected to work with their Faculty Advisor
    throughout the semester. The faculty advisor can be any tenured or tenure-track faculty in the Cockrell School of
    Engineering.
5.  Each team will produce a series of reports and presentations as the semester progresses, culminating in a final
    WRITTEN REPORT. Grades on the final report will focus on quality and completeness rather than on quantity
    and effort alone. Sponsor and faculty advisor feedback will be used to determine final grades. Dr. Crawford grades
    the final written report. The student manual has a sample final report grading sheet.
6.  A FINAL ORAL PRESENTATION is given to the sponsors, faculty, and Mechanical Engineering students. The
    presentations are graded by the entire MEw266K teaching staff. The student manual has a sample oral presentation
    grading-sheet. The final presentation and final report take the place of a final exam. All presentations will be given via
    Zoom.
EVALUATIONS OF THE COURSE are performed at the completion of the course using the approved Cockrell
School of Engineering common form.

As the table shows, 75% of your grade is based on the final oral presentation, the final written report, and the project
notebook. Also, 50% of the final written report (20% of the total points for the course) is based on the quality of the design
solution. Thus, the four most important factors in determining your final grade are:
    1.    The quality of the design solution;
    2.    The quality of the final written report;
    3.    The quality of the final oral presentation; and
    4.    The quality of your project notebook.
                                                               3


Final grades for the class are assigned on the plus/minus (+/-) grading system according to the following scale:
                                                        91-100      A

                                                        71-78       C
                                                        70          C-
                                                        69          D+
                                                        61-68       D

The following considerations may result in grade adjustments:
1.  GRADES FOR INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS may be adjusted up or down to account for differences in performance of
    individual members of a design team, based on peer evaluations and evaluations by TAs.
2.  LECTURE AND LAB ABSENCES may result in modification of an individual student’s final grade.
3.  FAILURE TO WORK WITH YOUR FACULTY ADVISOR OR SPONSOR will result in a significant grade
    reduction.
COURSE GUIDELINES
1.   TEXT: None. Course materials are provided via the course's Canvas site (http://canvas.utexas.edu/).
2.   DESIGN NOTEBOOK: Each team member will use the provided Google Docs notebook template to record design
     notes, meeting notes, Gantt charts, sketches, calculations, research and patent information, experimental data, and
     related items pertaining to the project. You should create and use a “UTmail” (Google for Edu) account to store your
     notebook file in your associated UTmail Google Drive instance. The TA periodically reviews the notebooks—you will
     export your current notebook as a pdf and upload it to the appropriate Canvas assignment (NotebookCheck1,
     NotebookCheck2, NotebookFinal). At the end of the semester, each student will also include their notebook pdf in the
     team's UT Box folder which you share to your sponsor.
3.   DEADLINES for the required reports and oral presentations determine the pace of the course. Each student receives a
     course schedule (inside the front cover of the bluebook) that lists all deadlines for submission of individual and team
     reports. Grade deductions may result for any work received after the specified deadline (if the work is accepted). There
     will be no deadline extensions.
4.   The UNIVERSITY WRITING CENTER (http://uwc.utexas.edu/) provides free writing assistance for any UT
     undergraduate, by appointment. All consultations will be offered online..
5.   ONLINE VIDEO WEBCASTS of previous Final Presentations are available for viewing. You will need to download
