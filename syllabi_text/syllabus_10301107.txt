Course Description
Border crossing by cultures and groups from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, and the
Caribbean islands has generated the production of images by immigrants, exiles, and
nomads in alien lands. With examples drawn from various continents, class investigates
art across borders in the contexts of the cultural circumstances that produced the
diasporas. Students will investigate the arts of voluntary, forced, colonial, distant, and
recent diasporas. Illustrations will draw on images, music, and videos.
