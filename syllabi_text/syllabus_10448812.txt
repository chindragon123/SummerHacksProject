are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural
experience.
Course Objectives
1. Students will increase their knowledge about and sensitivity toward persons with disabilities.
2. Students will acquire a knowledge of the following concepts related to exceptionalities:
        a. Legal and theoretical definitions
        b. Prevalence and etiologies
        c. Educational and social/emotional characteristics
        d. Family involvement and dynamics
        e. Life span issues, and
        f. Assistive technology.
3. Students will gain knowledge and understanding of the socio-cultural and linguistic factors
    that influence perceptions of disability, quality of life, and services for persons with
    disabilities.
I. Course Requirements and Considerations
Required Textbook
Kauffman, J., & Hallahan, D. (2011). Handbook of Special Education. This text is available as
        an ebook through PCL
There will be additional readings and videos.
 Class Attendance
Students are expected to attend all class sessions; however, class attendance will not be
considered in grading. You DO NOT need to inform me if you will be absent for class; however,
consistent class attendance is recommended for the following reasons:
    • The reading material will be further explained in class and there will be in-class
        activities.
    • In-class discussions will cover material from sources other than readings.


    •    Guest speakers - if possible - will cover selected topics from a personal/professional
         perspective.
Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class schedules. If you miss a class session or
assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day you will be given an
opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. It is the
policy of The University of Texas at Austin that you must notify each of your instructors at least
fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a religious
holy day, or on the first day of class if the religious holiday falls within the first two weeks of the
semester.
Class Participation
Each student is expected to attend each class session and to participate in class discussions and
activities. Class sessions will be a mixture of lecture, discussion, and in-class activities. In order
to effectively participate in each class session, students should complete all of the assigned
readings prior to coming to class and be prepared to discuss/apply the readings during class.
Students are also required to bring their textbook and any supplemental materials to class to
facilitate discussion and participation in class activities. Being a good participant does not
require that you address every question posed. You should, however, try to address questions or
comments, posed by the instructor and your class members on a regular basis. Your responses
should be thoughtful and always respectful of others, even when you may disagree with their
perspective.
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward
peers and community.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
For further information please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site:

If you are suspected of academic dishonesty, I will refer your case directly to the Student
Judicial Services office.

the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/

Steps for Presentation:
1. Define the problem or question of interest. (e.g., what type of reading interventions work with
middle school ELL kids? OR what effects does a father-based intervention have on family stress
in parents with kids with autism?
2.Identify sources (e.g., reference databases, journals) and search terms used to collect articles
relevant to your statement of problem or question of interest.
3.What retrieved articles should be included or excluded based on suitability. Which articles do
you include and which do you not include and why?
4. Of the articles you chose to include describe across the articles: what are the main
points/takeaways? Summarize these across the articles.
5. What conclusions can be drawn from the summarization of findings across the articles you
chose to include?
6. What suggestions do you have for further work in the area of your presentation and what
implications are there for clinicians or practitioners?
7. An 8 to 10 question quiz at the end of your presentation over content of your presentation,
students are to take the quiz and then have it graded by the person sitting next to them.
Course Feedback
It is the policy of the College of Education that all organized courses be evaluated using a Course
Instructor Survey arranged through the Measurement and Evaluation Center at the end of the
semester. You will be given this course evaluation during the last week of the course. Student
evaluations remain anonymous; the instructor will not be present during the evaluation and will
not see the answer sheets until grades have been officially reported.
