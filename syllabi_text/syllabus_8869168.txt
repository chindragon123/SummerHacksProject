      Foundations Of Arts And Entertainment Technologies
                                                AET 304
          “In this electronic age, we see ourselves being translated more and more into the form of
      information, moving toward the technological extension of consciousness.” – Marshall McLuhan

I.       Rationale:
This course presents a broad overview of digital media technologies, software and
applications along with the fundamental concepts of digital representations of images
and signals. Students will study an assortment of entertainment concepts or
experiences, discover the underlying technology involved and learn how this
technology is delivered to the participant. For example: What is the relationship
between circuit-bending and DIY electronics? How does interactive art work? How
do robotic lights move? How can a dancer’s body movements affect the music that
accompanies the dance? What goes on behind the scenes of a large-scale live musical
performance? How are 3D printers changing art, manufacturing, and medicine? In
pursuit of answers to such questions students will also consider the cultural,
philosophical, ethical and practical aspects of entertainment technology.
II.      Course Aims and Objectives:
By the end of this course, students will:
    •   Understand the history, present and future of Arts and Entertainment Technologies
    •   Consider the historical landmarks of entertainment technologies and their continuing impact
        on popular culture and pop culture aesthetics of the present and future

AET304 Course Syllabus
   •  Experience and investigate the range of Arts and Entertainment Technologies
   •  Understand and engage arts and entertainment technologies through various creative projects
   •  Gain introductory-level experience on visual- and audio-editing software
   •  Explore the range, reach and combinatorial possibilities of arts and entertainment
      technologies
   •  Consider and discuss the cultural, political, and economic issues of entertainment
      technologies
   •  Think critically about how, why and where entertainment technologies are deployed
III.    Assessment Model:
        Daily Instapolls: 10%
               Instapoll questions can cover material from the assigned readings or the live broadcast
               session, so attentiveness to both is essential. The two lowest session grades for each
               student will automatically be dropped from Canvas. In addition, Instapolls may be
               excused by requesting excused absences (see Section VI below).
        Daily Attendance: 10%
               Daily Attendance is assessed automatically based on each student being logged into the
               LAITS broadcast stream in Canvas for the entirety of the class session. Daily Attendance
               may be excused by requesting excused absences (see Section VI below).
        In-Class Quizzes (via online Tower Quiz Tool) (5): 25%
               Quizzes are administered through the LAITS broadcast stream on Canvas during specific
               class sessions. Each Quiz is worth 5% total grade and none may be dropped.
        In-Class Topical Discussion (via online Tower Chat Tool) (6): 20%
               Topical Discussions are administered through the LAITS broadcast stream on Canvas during
               specific class sessions. Each is worth 4% total grade (5 graded). The one lowest Topical
               Discussion grade for each student will automatically be dropped from Canvas.
        Creative Projects (3): 20%
               Projects will be accepted up to two weeks after the due date with an increasing penalty
               relative to how late the submission is. After the two weeks are up, any late projects
               must be emailed directly to the TA Team and can only receive 50% maximum of the
               original grade value. December 10 is the last day that any late projects will be accepted.
        Final Exam (via Canvas) (1): 15%
               Absolutely no late submissions will be accepted for the Final Exam.
        Letter Grade Policy:
                                                       2


AET304 Course Syllabus
         To ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus
         a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999... The University does not recognize the
         grade of A+. Thus, the conversion from percentage value to letter grade is as follows:
         A = 94 – 100
         A- = 90 – 93.999…
         B+ = 87 – 89.999…
         B = 84 – 86.999…
         B- = 80 – 83.999…
         C+ = 77 – 79.999…
         C = 74 – 76.999…
         C- = 70 – 73.999…
         D+ = 67 – 69.999…
         D = 64 – 66.999…
         D- = 60 – 63.999…
         F = 0 – 59.999…
IV.     Academic Integrity
Cheating and Plagiarism
By enrolling in this course, you agree to abide by the student Honor Code and Academic Integrity policies
as outlined by the Office of the Dean of Students here. Infractions of this policy will be severely penalized.
We have uncovered evidence of students cheating on quizzes or caught plagiarism on creative projects red-
handed in the past. In such cases, failing the course, suspension from school, or even expulsion are all
penalties that may be applied at the discretion of the Office of the Dean of Students. Academic Dishonesty
may ruin your grade, academic career, and can stain your reputation for decades to come.
Academic Dishonesty
“Academic dishonesty” or “scholastic dishonesty” includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism,
collusion, falsifying academic records, misrepresenting facts, and any act designed to give unfair academic
advantage to the student or the attempt to commit such an act. In AET 304, this includes but is not limited
to:
        1) Submitting all or part of someone else’s work as your own, without properly crediting your
            sources (this especially applies to creative projects)
        2) Sharing answers to Instapoll checks, quizzes, or exams with other students
        3) Taking Instapolls, Quizzes, or the Final Exam together with other students. If you are with
            other students during the broadcast, do not interact with them while taking these.
        4) Using forbidden aids like internet searches on Instapolls, Quizzes, or the Final Exam

VI. Course Requirements
         1. Class attendance and participation policy:
                   (a) Attendance—and attentiveness—is essential and required. Attendance is facilitated
                       through the LAITS broadcast stream in Canvas and assessed by Instapoll and
                       discussions.
                   (b) If one must miss a class session and desires to ask for an excused absence, it is the
                       student’s responsibility to let the TA team know by email in advance of the absence.
                       We do not guarantee an excused absence will be granted if you notify us only after
                       missing a class session. It is the student’s responsibility to catch up with material or
                       class activities missed due to the absence—the TA team will not necessarily remind
                       the student of what needs to be made up from the class session missed.
                   (c) Instapolls and Attendance can be excused, but other in-class activities—Quizzes and
                       Topical Discussions—must be made up or they will receive zeroes. There is a narrow
                       window of time after each missed in-class activity within which make-up submissions will
                       be accepted, so contact the TA Team ASAP after the missed class session (or preferably,
                       before) to receive instruction on how to make up the assignment.
                   Religious Holy Days
                   By UT Austin policy, you must notify the TA Team of your pending absence at least
                   fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a
                   class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious
                   holy day, we will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
                   reasonable time after the absence. With advance notice, we are happy to accommodate
                   religious holy days.
         2. Required Course Materials:
                   Required Textbook: Pixels, Samples, Lumens, Illusion by Dr. Jack W. Stamps. Kendall Hunt
                   Publishing (Dubuque, IA: 2017). Available in the UT Co-Op in paperback or as a digital
                   copy at the below link (with a $35 discount!):
                   https://he.kendallhunt.com/product/pixels-samples-lumens-illusion-foundations-art-and-
                   entertainment-technologies
                   The textbook comes with a one-use code for accessing online supplemental materials
                   including links to videos, websites, music tracks, and more. Being able to access these
                   online supplemental materials will be essential to success in the course. Thus, buying a
                   physical or digital textbook with a working access code is required. Buying a used
                   textbook may result in having an access code that has already been used once and is thus
                   invalid.
VII. Other University Notices and Policies
 Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence to Students
 All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student notification
 policy. It is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or
 her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in
 order to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain
 communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a
 minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your
 e-mail address are available at http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564 .

Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six
(6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:
          “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit
   an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer
   student has dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause
   for dropping more than that number.”
