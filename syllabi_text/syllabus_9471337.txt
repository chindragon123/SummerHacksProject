Course Description:
This course focuses on essential developments in Greek history (social, cultural, and
political) during the Late Classical (ca. 404-338 BCE) and Hellenistic (ca. 338-30 BCE)
Periods: from the aftermath of the Peloponnesian War, a period of hostilities between
Athens and Sparta and the allies of each that lasted almost thirty years, to the conquest
of Greece by Rome. The course will devote roughly equal time to covering major events
and personalities, exploring key developments in culture and society, and examining the
various types of evidence available for the era (both written and archeological sources).
We will begin (Part I. Weeks 1-4) with the history of the Greek city-state (poleis) in the
Late Classical period and their subjugation in 338 BCE by Philip II, king of Macedonia and
father of Alexander the Great. Next we will consider (Part II. Weeks 4-5) Alexander the
Great and his creation of the largest empire then known (ca. 356-323 BCE). Thereafter,
we will focus on the so-called “Successor Kingdoms” (Part III. Weeks 6-10) and explore
the struggles of Alexander’s generals after his death to carve out for themselves a share
of Alexander’s empire. Historians refer to the time of the successor kings and their
empires (ca. 323-30 BCE) as the Hellenistic Period, a title that reflects the introduction
of Greek culture to Asia and Africa (Egypt) and the development of various shades of
hybrid (Greek and native) society and culture. Part IV. Weeks 11-14 will explore some
aspects of the phenomenon of Hellenization and of the indigenous reactions to it. We
will conclude (Part V. Weeks 14-15) with a brief look at Rome’s developing interest in
the east and its conquest first of Greece (146 BCE), then Asia, and finally Egypt, where
the death of Cleopatra VII (30 BCE) brought an end to the last of the successor kings and
their empires.
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or
present.

1. Required Texts
Austin, M. M., The Hellenistic world from Alexander to the Roman conquest.
        Cambridge.
Walbank, F. W., The Hellenistic World. Harvard.
Supplementary Readings will be posted on Canvas.
2. Canvas
We will make extensive use of Canvas. In addition to the Syllabus, you will find the
following course materials there:
        •   “Assignment and Study Guide” for each lecture
        •   “Assignment and Study Guide” for the each week’s discussion section
        •   weekly quizzes
        •   study guides for the three examinations
        •   supplementary readings
        •   powerpoints
3. Lectures
There will be two weekly lectures (MW 12:00-1:00 PM in Mezes Hall 1.120). These will
combine historical outline with exploration of historical themes and problems in the
interpretation of historical evidence. In order to get the most out of the lectures you will
need to complete the reading assignment in advance of the lecture.
The Syllabus provides a road map for the course. You will find the assignments on
Canvas in Modules. The Assignments will list the readings for the day, study questions to
help guide you through the readings, and sometimes links to websites, images, etc. You
are not required to write out answers to the questions asked on the Assignment and
Study Guide for each lecture unless you are specifically asked to do so. We will not take
up all of the questions together in lecture, but you should be able to respond to them.
4. Discussion Sections
The weekly sections are required; informed participation in them will constitute a major
part of your final grade (see below). The main purpose of the discussion sections is to
learn how to analyze ancient sources and discuss interpretations of them both orally
and in writing. You will find the assignments for the discussion sections, study questions,
and sometimes links to websites, images, etc. on Canvas. You should come prepared to
discuss the questions in the discussion sections. You MUST bring the relevant materials
                                             -2-

Discussion Section Participation. Informed participation in discussion is required,
meaning that you must contribute regularly to the in-class conversation and
demonstrate your familiarity with the primary sources (both textual and archaeological)
assigned for each section.
Weekly Quizzes. Every week on Monday afternoon (starting from Week 3) a quiz
concerning the primary source readings assigned for the Thursday-Friday sections will
be posted on Canvas. You are required to complete the quiz before 11:00 AM on
Thursday.
In-Class Presentation. Each of you will be in charge of presenting the ancient sources for
one of the sections to your section mates and instructor. We will begin the in-class
presentation in Week 4. In Week 3 your TA and I will model how to organize the
presentation and will set up a calendar for the rest of the semester.
5. Calendar and Grading
15%     Midterm #1                Monday, February 25

Alexander and the Hellenistic World      Spring 2019                            Prof. P. Perlman
There will be no curve. If 50% of you score over 93, 50% of you will get an A. If nobody
does, nobody will. Consistent improvement during the semester will improve your final
course grade.
When merely quantitative methods cannot be applied, I will assign grades according to
the following qualitative standards: an A-range grade (A+, A, A-) indicates complete
mastery of the material and skills involved in the assignment; B-range grade (B+, B, B-)
indicates advanced competency; a C-range grade (C+, C, C-) indicates basic competency;
a D-range grade (D+, D, D-) indicates effort but insufficient competency; an F means that
either you put no effort in the assignment or something went dramatically wrong.
If you have a question about a grade you receive on an exam you must wait at least one
day before seeing your instructor or TA and you must read through any comments on
the exam. Please be aware that it you do object to the grading of some portion of your
exam, we will read through the entire exam. This could result in your score going up or
down.
Consistent improvement during the semester will be taken into account in determining
your final course grade. Make-up exams will be arranged only in the event of
documented illness or other emergencies; you must let me know as far in advance of
the exam as possible. Additionally, students may make up work missed for a religious
holiday if they bring documentation of the holiday fourteen days in advance.
6. Attendance
Attendance is mandatory for discussion sections and (of course) strongly encouraged for
lectures. Each student is allowed 1 unexcused absences from discussion section without
penalty. Any other absence must be appropriately documented (e.g., with a doctor’s
note or a note from Student Emergency Services – Office of the Dean of Students).
Notify me of your situation as soon as possible and document it immediately upon your
return.
Failure to comply with these rules will result in the loss of 1% of your final grade for
each unexcused absence.
7. Class Etiquette
Cell phones should be turned off or set to silent ring during class time. The use of
laptops and tablets is allowed only for taking notes and checking assigned readings.
Phones, laptops, and tablets must be put away and turn off during exams. Failure to do
so will result in the immediate invalidation of the exam.
Scholastic dishonesty on any graded assignment or quiz/exam will result in zero credit

Alexander and the Hellenistic World      Spring 2019                          Prof. P. Perlman
on the assignment or quiz/exam. A second infraction will result in an F for the course. All
cases of scholastic dishonesty will be reported to the student’s college adviser.
Scholastic dishonesty includes any kind of cheating or collaboration on tests, or
submitting work that is not either your own or accurately attributed to its source. For
more information, contact Student Judicial Services at 471-2841, or go

Note: students are expected to present a UT "accommodation letter" authorizing
specific accommodations.
9. Religious Holidays
If you need to miss a class or other required class activity for the observance of a
religious holiday, you must notify me at least 14 days in advance so we can make
alternative arrangements for your absence.
Note: the University's Religious Days Policy is online:
http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/
10. UT Honor Code
