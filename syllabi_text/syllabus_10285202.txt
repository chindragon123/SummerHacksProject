Description: With an emphasis on rock, pop, rap, disco, and country in the US since 1960, this course
will look closely at individual songs as a means to understand larger trends in US cultural history
(including various Civil Rights movements, de-industrialization and economic dislocation, cultural
polarization, anti-war movements, etc.). This course is not primarily musicological in approach, but
instead looks at popular song through the lens of cultural studies, sociology, and history. Many artists will
be considered on a list that ranges across genres and even national boundaries. Not all are Americans,
but all of these artists were important to particular moments and movements in recent American history.
More than anything, we will be learning to listen closely and think about music as a portal onto cultural
landscapes.
