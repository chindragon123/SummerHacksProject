INTRODUCTION: This course examines the evidence for the origin and evolution of humans with
particular emphasis placed on reconstructing the paleobiology and behavior of extinct hominins. Lectures
will draw upon a diverse range of disciplines (anatomy, archaeology, ecology, ethology, genetics,
geology, paleontology) and integrate these into a framework for understanding the history of this unusual
group of primates. The laboratories provide the student with an opportunity to examine firsthand the
fossil evidence for human evolution.
REQUIRED READINGS: The following textbooks are required for the course:
• Klein, R.G. 2009. The Human Career. The University of Chicago Press. 3rd edition.
• Kappelman, J. 2007. Virtual Laboratories for Physical Anthropology. 4th edition. Labs are available
     online from UT’s TXShop website, and the instructions are available on the Canvas course website.
     VLabs can be used with these browsers: Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer (but not Google
     Chrome). If you already have a copy from a previous course, that will work. For purchase, go to the

COURSE POLICY ON ACADEMIC HONESTY
Students who cheat not only cheat themselves but also cheat other students in the course and harm the
reputation of the University. Any student found cheating will receive an F in the course and will be
directed to the appropriate University authorities for additional sanctions that may include dismissal from
the University. Please see the Honor Code to review the UT policy.
Students ARE NOT permitted to copy by any means down exam questions, ARE NOT permitted to copy
by any means down the answers to the exam questions, and ARE NOT permitted share this information
with another student(s). Students ARE NOT permitted to discuss the content of the exams with each other,
and this includes all possible venues (informal hallway chat, websites, forums, Facebook, etc.).
Students ARE NOT permitted to discuss or share laboratory assignments and answers with another
student(s), ARE NOT permitted to collaborate on the completion of these assignments unless specifically
directed to do so, and ARE NOT permitted to submit assignments for one another.
A student(s) who requests any exam or lab information puts the other students in the course at risk and
will receive an F in the course even if no information is supplied by other students.
This course has a zero tolerance policy for cheating. Any questions about the lab assignments and
exams should be directed to the professor and teaching assistant, NOT to your fellow students.
I have read and understand the above rules and agree to follow these course and University
policies.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS
Laboratory Assignments
Weekly laboratories provide the student with a hands-on examination and evaluation of the fossil record
for human origins and evolution. The labs provide an in-depth study of a particular topic presented in that
week’s lecture. Each of 11 labs consists of a 30-45 minute lecture that introduces the problem that in turn
is followed by about 30-45 minutes of data collection. In order to use lab time efficiently, students must
come to lab having already read the lab materials and familiarized themselves with the assignment.
In many cases students will be able to complete much of the laboratory assignment write-up during the
lab time. The TA will instruct the class as to whether or not it is permissible for students to work together
on data collection and write up; if the TA does not explicitly state that cooperation is permitted, students
should assume that all work must be their own. Assignments are due at the beginning of the following
lab. Extension requests are subject to the rules as presented below.
Examinations
There are two hourly exams in the course. The first part of each exam is a computer-based multimedia
test that is administered during regular lab times. This test includes materials from the textbook, labs, and
lectures within 1) a multiple-choice, matching, and plotting format, and 2) an interactive exercise. The
first part of the test can be attempted twice, with the highest of the two grades counting toward the final
grade. The second part of the test can be completed one time only.
A take-home open book essay question is assigned with each exam and is submitted via email. It has a
length limit of five pages and must include appropriate citations. Students have at least one week to
complete the essay and submit it via email.
eFossils Team Term Project
The fossil record for human evolution has expanded dramatically over the past quarter century and it is
now difficult to easily present these numerous findings. Prof. Kappelman and his team of developers have
built a website, eFossils, that offers a useful means for aggregating these findings within a “map-app.”
Students will be assigned to teams of five members, given a fossil site, and then work together to
investigate the subtopics (hominins, archaeology, fauna, geology, paleoecology). The results will be
posed to eFossils. Student team members will earn publication authorship for the assignment. Each team
will briefly present its findings in class during the last week of the semester.
There is almost no work in any of the sciences that today represents the work of a single person, and
paleoanthropology with its large teams is an excellent case in point of how scientists do their work. This
term-length assignment offers a realistic experience about how team-based science is conducted.
Class and Lab Attendance and Participation
Attendance in class and lab is recorded. Everyone has something to contribute, and participation counts!
Extra Credit
Explore UT. It is critical that scientists engage with the public, and students have the opportunity to
volunteer at Explore UT as part of Prof. Kappelman’s lab group. In addition, students are always
welcome to volunteer in the lab and participate in the various ongoing digital imaging projects, many of
which are designed for the public (e.g., eSkeletons, eFossils, eLucy).
In the news. You probably know that paleoanthropology is an active field. You can earn extra credit by
submitting a brief paragraph that links to and describes a new discovery in human evolution:
• Subject line: “In the news by [your name]”
• Body: brief paragraph describing the finding and its significance/relationship to human evolution

A 348 LECTURE AND READINGS SCHEDULE
Below are listed the reading assignments from the two required texts used in this course (Klein's
The Human Career and Kappelman's Virtual Laboratories). In addition, there are weekly
laboratory readings that must be completed before you attend you assigned lab.
In addition to weekly readings from the textbook and Virtual Labs, we assign weekly readings
from primary science journals that provide more detailed information about discoveries or ideas
in the field. These articles will be posted each week on Canvas. A few questions that will aid
your understanding of these articles will be included with each week’s readings. These readings
are an important addition to studying for the two hourly exams and essays and can also
assist you with the weekly lab assignment writeups.
The “Klein” textbook is given by chapter number and “VL” refers to lab number from the
Virtual Laboratories. Items in italics are University deadlines.

INTRODUCTION TO THE LABORATORIES
The laboratory sections of this course are designed to provide you with the opportunity to gain hands-on
experience with the materials and methods of paleoanthropology. Because such experience is vital to a
better understanding of the course of human evolution, the grade you receive in lab will account for 30%
of your total grade in the class. It is essential that you attend lab. The following guidelines will be
followed for lab sections:
     1) All lab assignments are due at the beginning of the following week's lab.
     2) NO late lab homework will be accepted unless a documented and verifiable excuse (e.g., doctor's
         note, obituary, etc.) is provided by the student. If you anticipate a difficulty ahead of time, or have
         a documented conflict as a consequence of a university activity, you should contact the TA or
         professor ASAP.
     3) You must attend the lab section for which you are registered. If an unforeseen problem arises and
         you cannot attend your lab, talk to the TA in order to see if you can attend a different session.
         Your lab assignment will still be due at the beginning of your registered lab section.
     4) While we encourage you to interact and exchange ideas with other students, the lab assignments
         that you submit must be your own work.

DISABILITIES, EXTENSIONS, and DROPS and INCOMPLETES
Disabilities
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of
Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259.
Extension requests
Requests for an extension for missed work because of a sanctioned University activity, documented
illness, family-related emergency, or death in the family will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but
whatever the circumstance, documentation is required. If you are unable to document your excuse, you
will not be permitted to make up the missed work. Whatever the case – sanctioned University activity,
documented illness, family-related emergency, or death in the family – full documentation is required.
If you find yourself so sick that you must miss an exam or lab submission, you should see a doctor, and if
you do, the doctor will give you a written excuse.
Permission to make up missed exams or labs requires a completed Extension Permission Request Form
(available on the Canvas class website) and supporting documentation (see below). The extension request,
consisting of a completed Extension Permission Request form along with supporting documentation, must
be submitted no later than one week following the missed exam or lab deadline date (e.g., if you miss a
Friday deadline date, the extension request form and documentation must be received no later than the
following Thursday).
Supporting documentation:
     •    If an illness, a medical excuse documented by a letter from your doctor;
     •    If a family emergency, written documentation;
     •    If a family death, an obituary or death certificate;
     •    If a University-sanctioned activity, a letter from the director of the organization delivered to us
          BEFORE the event since these events are scheduled months in advance; and
     •    If a work-related conflict, a note from your supervisor.
If a scheduling conflict arises from work or some other issues that will cause you to miss a deadline,
please inform us as early as possible so we can assess the validity of the conflict and make any necessary
arrangements. If you do not tell us ahead of time about a scheduled event, you will not receive permission
to make up the missed work.
The extension request must receive approval before any missed work can be made up. If you cannot
provide independent documentation that we can verify, the extension request will not be approved. We
check on all excuses by calling the doctor, supervisor, family member, and faculty supervisor or coach.
During the days when a completed extension request is under evaluation, you should continue to meet the
exam and lab schedule.
Drops and Incompletes
If you find that you are unable to complete the course, you may obtain a drop with a “Q” if you file the
appropriate paperwork (available from your dean’s office) by the required University deadline date.
An incomplete after the deadline date can generally only be granted for a serious medical condition as
documented by a letter from your doctor. In only exceptional cases are other excuses considered
legitimate grounds for an incomplete, and these excuses require approval from your dean’s office.
