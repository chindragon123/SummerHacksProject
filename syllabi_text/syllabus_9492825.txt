COURSE DESCRIPTION
What is the contemporary Entertainment business and how does PR function within the main divisions under its
umbrella? How do Entertainment publicists interact with Marketing, key executives, content creators, social
media teams, talent, and media? What skills must be mastered to succeed in Entertainment PR? How are
Entertainment publicists adapting to the industry’s key issues (i.e., waves of conglomeration, consolidation,
across-the-board technological disruptions and social media movements)?
From an academic and professional point of view, we will explore Hollywood as the center of “the business of
entertainment” and analyze current PR practices and activities to enable a greater understanding of the rapidly
changing rules of Entertainment PR.
As we analyze the development – and increasing interrelatedness – of the Entertainment Industry from the early
20th century to the present, we will define what an Entertainment publicist does and explore the skill set one
must develop, including:
    •   Media Relations (e.g., direct contact with media, bloggers and critics to pitch, shape, and facilitate
        stories)
    •   Press Release/Materials writing/editing/approvals
    •   Media Training (e.g., teaching and preparing executives and talent for interviews)
    •   Event Planning
    •   On-site/On-location/Unit Publicity
    •   Brand Launch/Maintenance
    •   Strategic Partnerships
    •   Internal Communication
    •   Crisis Communication
    •   Social Media Planning/Messaging
    •   Speech Writing
    •   Charitable Tie-ins
    •   Research/Specialized Knowledge, Technological Expertise and Pedagogy

Primarily, we will focus on the structure, practices, products and promotion of Hollywood’s film and television
industries. Through guest speakers and readings, we will also explore the areas of music/radio,
print/publishing, licensing & merchandising, live exhibition/theater, and specific PR practices within.

Two Exams: There will be a Midterm Exam and a Final Exam. Both exams consist of multiple choice, fill-in-
the-blank, and true-false questions. They cover all readings, lectures and in-class discussions. Review sheets
will be available and discussed during the class prior to each exam.
Response Assignments/Quizzes/: Along with participation, this portion of your grade rewards you for
attending class regularly and keeping up with assigned readings. Over the course of the semester, there will be
in-class quizzes (1-3 questions). Students will be alerted to an upcoming quiz prior to each class. Quizzes will
take place at the start of class. No late assignments will be accepted. No make-up quizzes will be given. In
other words, students who are not on time and in class to participate in these activities will not, of course,
receive credit for this. And they cannot be made up except in the case of serious illness and other emergencies
with documentation, as well as pre-excused religious holidays.
Media Conglomerate paper assignment: This assignment asks you to build upon your readings, lectures and
class material with independent, outside research on a media conglomerate of your choice. More information
will be provided in-class/via Canvas on 2/4. Your topic is due at the beginning of class on 2/18 and the final
assignment is due 3/25. APA style must be used. Times New Roman, 12 pt. font. (APA Style resource:
http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/)
PR Case Study / Final paper assignment: Building upon your research for the Media Conglomerate
Assignment, this assignment asks that identify a recent – successful OR failed - PR campaign for a project
within your conglomerate. It should be a project that was not extensively explored in class. More information
about this assignment will be provided in class on 3/25. Proposals, which will include your chosen case study, a
preliminary outline and a works cited list, are due on 4/8. The final paper is due at the start of class on 4/29,
when you will give present a 10-min. overview of the study and your analysis. APA style must be used. Times
New Roman, 12 pt. font.
Case Study Presentation: Present a timed 10-min. presentation on your case study. Include overview of case
study and highlights, with an assessment of the PR campaign and positive/negative implications for your
conglomerate and/or the Entertainment industry as a whole. Please prepare an overhead PowerPoint
presentation (5-10 slides, with one hard copy for instructor). Handouts are also acceptable (bring copies for
entire class and instructor). Presentations will be graded according to the Rubric for Formal Oral
Communication (posted on Canvas):

Attendance/Participation: Attendance will be checked. You can have two unexcused absences, although work
missed during these absences may not necessarily be made up. Each unexcused absence afterwards will result
in your overall grade being reduced by 10 points.
Absences are only permitted for the following (and you are required to provide me with official verification for
these): Doctor’s orders; participating in an official UTLA activity (sports, music, etc.); OR unavoidable
disasters (i.e., death in the family, car accident on the way to class -- not job interviews, taking family members
to or from the airport, etc.). Arriving late or leaving early, without the instructor’s explicit permission, will
result in the deduction of 5 points each time.
Your attendance is necessary for you to fully participate in the class. To participate here means:
    • Behave professionally and civilly
    • Stay focused and engaged in all learning activities
    • Bring your best ideas into the conversation
    • Ask probing questions to clarify everyone’s understanding and extend ideas
    • Support your classmates when they need help and ask for support when you need it
    • Proactively contribute to the learning community
In addition, you will need to be in class to turn in assignments, take quizzes, and get informed about future
assignments. If you are not there for in-class assignments, you can’t get credit for the work done by others
during class time. You are responsible for all material covered in class. If you are absent, it is your
responsibility to find out what you missed from another student.
Regarding withdrawals:
I want every student to learn and be successful in this class. If you find yourself struggling to understand the
material or keep pace with the assignments, please don’t hesitate to contact me so we can address the issue
together. If you stay in contact and remain engaged in class, I might consider extra credit on a case-by-case
basis.
A student who wishes to withdraw from all University classes after completing registration for a semester must
secure the dean's approval. For more information on withdrawals, see
https://registrar.utexas.edu/students/registration/after/withdrawal.
X | Temporary delay of final course grade:
The symbol X is not issued for student or faculty convenience; it may be issued for one of the following reasons
only in the case of compelling, nonacademic circumstances beyond the student's control: 1) missing the final
examination; 2) incomplete classroom assignments; or 3) reexamination petition. If the final course grade is not
reported before the end of the next long-session grade reporting period, a grade of F is recorded for the course.
The X symbol remains on the student's record. For more, see General Information.
Tips to succeed in this class:
•   Check Canvas / Email regularly. Along with additional required readings, all assignments, handouts and
    announcements will be made available to you on Canvas and/or emailed to you directly. It is your
    responsibility to check Canvas/your email accounts so that you can get all the class documents. In addition,
    you can look up your scores on assignments via the Canvas grade book. When in doubt, check Canvas.

•   Remember that class notes/overheads provided in class are only guidelines. Many of the questions on the
    Midterm and Final Exams will come from weekly lecture material presented only during class meetings.
    However, this does not mean that you will be prepared for the exam simply by copying down the materials
    provided during overheads. Think critically about what you read – do NOT just memorize facts and figures.
    Be sure to take notes from – and think about – what I say, what we discuss as a class, and what you read.
•   Life happens. When assignments are due, expect the unexpected. Hard deadlines are a fact of life in Public
    Relations. Get ready and assume that one (or perhaps all) of the following will happen to you on Exam
    dates and assignment due dates:
    è Your printer will not print
    è Your computer will crash and all data will be lost
    è Your car will not run, your phone died and you can’t call an Uber/Lyft, and all your friends will be out of
    town
Please take whatever steps are necessary to prevent these events from affecting your deadlines for assignments.

integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, falsifying
academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic
dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of
essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor.
By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty
damages both the student’s learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a career.
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including
the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. More information on student
conduct and academic integrity is available at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php
