Course Description:
In less than a century Egypt experienced four radically different forms of political
community, economic organization and public culture as it swiftly moved from Colonialism
to Liberalism, Arab-Socialism and Authoritarian Capitalism. A fifth shift, Islamic
Republicanism is pending. In each stage Egypt went through a complete reshuffling of the
state structure and public culture. Each of these phases was experienced with great
emotional intensity. The aim of this class is to critically examine the social, political and
intellectual dynamics which shaped these experiences. What sort of expectations did
Egyptians have in each phase, who came up with these revisionist ideas, and who put them
to work and how?
