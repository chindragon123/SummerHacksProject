                                             COURSE DESCRIPTION
1) Course Description: Media management seeks to teach students how to identify consumer behavior and tailor
the specific media response in the most strategically effective way. This course introduces the theoretical concepts in
media management and the practical applications to specific media strategies. The course teaches students to
articulate the management decisions advertisers face in developing and executing media strategies. Students should
learn how to articulate the strategic process of advertising management, to understand the factors influencing media
management decisions, to strategically evaluate functioning advertising management strategies, and identify,
formulate and defend advertising decisions grounded in media management issues.
2) Course Learning Outcomes:
     WHAT:          Identify and critically analyze issues related to media management while using a Theory X
                    Practice approach
     HOW:           Students will be introduced to a variety of topics related to media management. Class meetings
                    will feature both theoretical foundations and practical applications of each topic.
     WHAT:          Develop a media plan that addresses a client’s primary business objectives.
     HOW:           Students will form groups and complete a media plan that addresses business objectives for a local
                    Austin business. Their media plan will be presented at the end of the semester.
     WHAT:          Students will creatively address business problems using a variety of media principles.
     HOW:           Students will participate in the Ketchum Mindfire Challenge.
     WHAT:          Define, identify, and research a specific, topic of the student’s choosing related to media that
                    leads to a “Subject Matter Expert (SME)” level of knowledge
     HOW:           Students will research a media topic of their choosing. The topic can be one we covered in class or
                    another topic that is of interest to the student’s preferred career path.
3) How to succeed in this course:
          Come Prepared to Participate: Come to class having prepared for the day by reading and be ready to
          discuss the day’s material.
          Collaborate with Classmates: A career path in advertising is driven through collaboration and discussion.
          Working in teams is crucial to brainstorming creative, strategic solutions.
          Give Feedback: Throughout the semester, please give your feedback on how you learn or topics that
          interest you.
                                          COURSE REQUIREMENTS:
1) Required Readings:
               o HBR Case Studies
               o The Course website on Canvas
               o Readings posted on the course website and/or distributed in class
2) Classroom Expectations:
          Respect your fellow classmates: In this course, we will have several class discussions. Opinions are
          welcomed; however, it is important to remember that others might not hold your same viewpoint.
          Discussions and healthy debates are an important part of the educational process. Please remember to
          respect your classmates and your professor in all classroom discussions. If you are in violation of this


        policy, you may be asked to leave the classroom. If you are asked to leave for behavioral violations, you
        will be counted as absent for the day.
        Know your industry: Students should read blogs, newsletters, or other periodicals that are relevant to the
        class discussion and provide thought-provoking content for class each week. Media is a quickly evolving
        field, and it is crucial to stay on top of new developments.
        Take full advantage of every opportunity: The University of Texas at Austin and the Moody College of
        Communication provides many wonderful resources to students. You should take advantage of every guest
        speaker, workshop, meeting, etc. that is made available to you. So often these connections and lessons can
        help land you an internship or a job.
3) Major Course assignments:
        Exams: (2 exams – 20% each, total 40%): Students are expected to read all assigned readings. These
        exams will assess what students have learned from course readings, lectures, and lab activities.
        Client Strategic Plan: (20%): All groups will develop a strategic plan for a local company. The plan will
        feature a short-term and long-term strategy that addresses the business’s primary objectives. More detailed
        assignment sheet to follow.
        Client Strategy Presentation (10%): Presentations will take place at the end of the semester and will
        require student groups to present their strategic plans. Presentations will be formal and will require students
        to wear business casual dress. More detailed assignment sheet to follow.
        Individual Media Research Paper (10%): Students will write a research report about a media
        management topic of their choice. This is an individual assignment. The paper should be 3-5 pages in
        length (not counting references, tables, etc.) and follow proper formatting guidelines (APA or MLA is
        acceptable). More detailed assignment sheet to follow.
        Ketchum Mindfire Challenges (10%): Students will participate in the Ketchum Mindfire challenge. You
        will receive access to the Ketchum portal, which will include problems that Ketchum’s client roster is
        currently facing. You will develop a creative idea that addresses the client ask. This challenge gives you an
        idea of the real problems agencies face, an opportunity to win prize money, and an opportunity to impress
        Ketchum.
        Class Discussion, Attendance, and Professional Conduct: (10%): Come to class prepared and ready to
        actively discuss readings and lectures, interact with classmates, the instructor, and industry guests. You
        will learn that learning flourishes in an active environment, and you are expected to help foster engagement
        throughout the course. I will evaluate your final participation grade based using the following rubric:
        A = Student engages in all activities; interacts with class members during face-to-face by providing
        constructive feedback; expresses individual thoughts and poses questions during each class session;
        actively participates in each small group session; volunteers for class discussion; prepared and familiar with
        course material when called upon; does not use technology (phones, tablets, laptops) inappropriately during
        class.
        B = Student sporadically fails to participate in-class discussion or on learning tasks. Student demonstrates
        lack of preparedness during class by not actively participating with group members to accomplish tasks.
        Student only occasionally volunteers for discussion, and comments/ questions are off-topic. Student uses
        technology (cell phones/tablets) for activities unrelated to the course.
        C = Student seldom volunteers to express ideas or shares thoughts during face-to face meetings. Student’s
        responses to questions demonstrate vague familiarity with module readings. Student is passive during
        group projects and needs reminders to stay on topic or to actively participate. Student frequently uses
        technology (i.e. cell phone, tablets) inappropriately during class.


      D and below = Student never volunteers, cannot answer direction questions related to the readings,
      participates in less than a semester of online discussion activities, and does not participate in group work
      during face-to-face sessions. Student is routinely using technology inappropriately in class (i.e. texting,
      emailing, Facebook-ing, etc.). Lack of participation and preparedness, both online and face-to-face, is
      routine throughout the semester.
