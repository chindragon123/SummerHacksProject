Overview
This course offers an introduction to environmental politics through the fields of
political ecology, critical race studies and eco-feminism. We will examine
environmental contestations to understand how humans relate to nature in the
context of global racial capitalism and the possibilities for creating a more
sustainable world. We will explore how racism is foundational to environmental
exploitation and consider why global struggles for racial justice are crucial for
protecting both people and the earth. Reflecting principles of environmental justice,
                                                                                      1


the course material respects the lived experiences, leadership and intellectual
insights of racialized peoples as a vital source of knowledge.
Drawing on literature and film, investigative reporting and primary documents, in
addition to academic publications, we will investigate:
    What is the relationship between race and nature in capitalism?
    Why does racial justice matter for the earth?
    How does environmental racism work in a globalized world?
    What strategies do marginalized peoples employ to survive and enact social change?
    How do we build a world that values the diversity of human and non-human life?
What’s this class about?
This is an interdisciplinary survey course, combining critical theory, social science
and environmental humanities, to examine how the exploitation of natural
resources is connected with the racism of colonization and capitalism. We will begin
with an introduction to the structural logics that shape the modern world, including
the human-nature binary, settler colonialism and racial capitalism. We will apply
these concepts to explore contestations over water, land, food, waste, metal, and
weather, by diverse actors including governments, corporations and social
movements. Our goal is to understand how space and resources are manipulated to
reproduce unequal environments, reflecting racial, classed and gendered dynamics,
and how alternate visions for socio-ecological sustainability seek to challenge and
undo racial capitalism. In closing, we will reflect on how the planetary crises we face
demand a rethinking of humans, earth and life itself.
Topics include:
    • conservation and wilderness preservation
    • waste and toxicity
    • food justice and sovereignty
    • urban ecology, clean water and safe housing
    • sustainable energy production
    • global climate justice
What will you take away from this class?
     An introduction to why environmental issues are political problems
     Experience applying critical race and gender analysis in addressing socio-
        ecological issues
     An appreciation for the significance of movements for environmental justice
     Invaluable critical thinking, reading and writing skills, as well as practice
        working in both teams and independently
     A sense of your capacities and potential contributions in creating change
                                                                                      2


How will you learn?
The course is structured as weekly units organized around key concepts. Each week,
we will closely read foundational scholarly texts that offer a nuanced understanding
of complex environmental problems. We will apply these theoretical insights to
specific case studies to explore their relevance in the real world, through guest
speakers, documents produced by grassroots movements, journalistic accounts and
primary research. Alongside these critical analyses, we will engage with creative
work from various genres (memoirs, short stories, nonfiction essays, poetry and
film), to inspire deeper reflection on the complexities of environmental issues and
their impact on human and non-human lives, including our own. Reflecting ethical
commitments to diverse knowledges, the class will incorporate work by a range of
thinkers, activists, and artists, and encourage you to consider yourselves as
knowledge producers based on your unique skills and interests.
About me
I am a geographer working in critical race and feminist studies. I use cultural
methodologies, including performance and visual methods, to study environmental
racism in collaboration with those who lives are devastated by global capitalism. I
enjoy teaching as part of my scholarship and activism, and am interested in how we
can create a more just university. In my past life, I ran afterschool programs for high
school youth, developed curricula for nonprofits, and danced professionally. I am a
lifelong student of movement, trained in traditional and contemporary South Asian
dance forms, yoga and Aikido, and I bring this bodily sensibility to my work.

Assessment
Your course grade includes 4 components, each worth 25% of your total grade:
Participation, a cumulative take-home Exam, a Group Project , and an independent
Creative Writing Project. I describe each component below. Additional instructions
and grading rubrics for each assignment will be provided on Canvas.
Grading policy, late work and extra credit
Every assignment is worth points, totaling 1000 points for the course. The chart
below shows each assignment, its point value, and percentage of the total grade.
Discussion forum posts and responses must be completed by the assigned date and
time; no exceptions will be made. For the Group and Creative writing projects, I will
deduct 10% from the final grade for each day that an assignment is late. After 3
days, the assignment will not be accepted and you will receive 0 points.
                                                                                      3


Opportunities for extra credit are built into class participation (maximum points
shown in parentheses below). For example, if you attend every class, you will have
earned 10 points extra credit. For an additional 10 points, you may attend a lecture
or event and write a response post on the Discussion Forum. See below for details.
Final grades are firm and there will be no additional curve.

Participation (25%)
Attendance
Attendance will be taken every class (total 100 points). There is a built in allowance
for up to 4 absences without a point penalty, regardless of the reason. However, you
are responsible for any class content missed due to absences. Please check in with
other students to cover material you miss; I will not go over class content with you
individually. Since this is a discussion-based course, missing class will adversely
impact your understanding of course material and preparation for exams.
                                                                                      4


In-class activities
You will periodically receive points for participation in in-class activities (total 50
points). You cannot make up points from in-class activities, regardless of the reason
you miss class.
Discussion forum: Reflections and Responses
You are required to write 5 weekly posts on the Discussion Forum reflecting on
readings in response to a prompt (see schedule below for opportunities). Engaging
consistently with the readings in this way will help you prepare for class and serve
as a helpful way to review for exams. Your reflections must be posted by 11:59pm
on Sunday. The goal of the reflections is to learn how to engage seriously with
scholarly work. Each post is worth a maximum of 10 points (total 50 points).
In addition to your own reflection, you must read your classmates’ posts and
respond to at least one of them 5 times. Your responses must be posted before class
on Mondays to receive credit. You can earn 10 points for each response (total 50
points).
Exam (25%)
You will be given one take-home exam on April 1 (due before class time on April 6)
that will assess your ability to define key terms, apply concepts, and synthesize
arguments. The exam will be cumulative and draw on all course material, including
readings, class discussions and lectures.
Group project (25%)
This project is an opportunity for you to apply and communicate critical analysis
with the class on a contemporary environmental topic of interest to you. With your
assigned group members, you will choose a current event that will you be
researching and teaching the class about. The project is scaffolded, involving four
phases: Proposal (memo outlining topic and individual contributions-50 points);
Preparation (annotated bibliography involving background research- 100 points);
Presentation (a concise and creative sharing of knowledge with the class- 100
points); and Peer evaluations (post-project reflection on group members’
contributions-no points). Each assignment, apart from the Peer evaluations, will
receive a shared group grade, requiring group members to contribute equally and
practice producing knowledge through collaboration. If a group member is found has
not contributed equally to the group project, according to their peer evaluations, their
group project grades will be marked down accordingly.
Creative writing project (25%)
For the final project, you will write a nonfiction essay in response to a prompt, that
explores the question of human-environment relations, ecological sustainability and
racial justice. This project is also scaffolded, involving four phases: Proposal (memo
outlining topic and form- 25 points); Preparation (annotated bibliography involving
background research- 75 points); Process (rough draft for peer review- 50 points);
and Product (the final revised submission- 100 points). Nonfiction essay writing
                                                                                        5


       offers practice in conducting secondary research on a topic that you care about and
       writing persuasively for a general audience.
       Please note: All assignments in this course may be processed by TurnItIn, a tool that
       compares submitted material to an archived database of published work to check
       for potential plagiarism. Other methods may also be used to determine if a paper is
       the student's original work. Regardless of the results of any TurnItIn submission,
       the faculty member will make the final determination as to whether or not a paper
       has been plagiarized.
