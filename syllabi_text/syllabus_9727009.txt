The course hopes to make the students critical of dominant bio-medical assumptions of
health and illness by exposing the historical, social, political, economic and cultural
foundations of Western Medicine. The readings will critically discuss the historical
construction of the modern medicalized body by looking at some nineteenth century
debates on anatomy, physiology, psychiatry and anthropology. The issue of race and
gender inherent in these debates will be explored by linking them to the expansion of the
colonial enterprise and the rise of capitalism. Material will be introduced to help students
evaluate the contemporary emphasis on the biomedical model of health and illness in
relation to the plurality of health systems in the different parts of the world. The course
seeks to further evaluate the linkage between modern medicine and the construction of
modern subjectivity and personhood.
Requirements: The students will be required to regularly attend the class. I shall also
expect students to have read the assigned material, as I shall run the class as a seminar
rather than a lecture course. I shall intervene and explain where necessary, but the onus
will be on the student(s) to lead and engage in discussions.. More than three absences
without notice shall reflect on your final grade. There shall be no exams. Instead I shall
expect class presentations, a group project and two papers. The paper and research topics
will be discussed and elaborated upon during the course of the semester.

Presentations and Last day of Class.
Final Paper due on December 5, before 5pm at SAC 5.126
The students will be asked to give presentations on any topic related to the course.


Research subjects may include archival work on the historical construction of body in
different geographical and cultural settings, de-constructing medical texts to look for
racial and gender biases, the social and individual causes of health and illness etc. The
historical and contemporary debates on different diseases (like Leprosy, Syphilis, Plague,
Tuberculosis, AIDS), their linkage to lifestyles, geographical area, class, and their
cultural construction and imagery in popular media, may serve as other sources of
research topics.
