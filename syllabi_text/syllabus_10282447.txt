This course carries the Cultural Diversity Flag. This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United
States. The purpose of the Cultural Diversity in the United States Flag is for students to explore in depth the shared
practices and beliefs of one or more underrepresented cultural groups subject to persistent marginalization. In
addition to learning about these diverse groups in relation to their specific contexts, students should engage in an
active process of critical reflection. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from
assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one underrepresented cultural group in the U.S.
Class Policies and instructions: please read carefully:
Class, labs and readings:
Class and lab attendance and participation are required and absences will affect the final grade.
There are no make-ups for labs or tests, except for justified absences which require a proper note (medical
or otherwise). Lab assignments that are not to be completed in lab will be due on the assigned date. This
is a fairness issue. Any lab assignment delivered late for any reason except for justified medical reasons,
will incur the loss of 2 points per day or fraction of the day.
All assigned readings are required and MUST be completed before class.
Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students: E-mail is recognized as an official mode of
university correspondence; therefore, you are responsible for reading your e-mail for university and
course-related information and announcements. You are responsible to keep the university informed
about changes to your e-mail address. You should check your e-mail regularly and frequently—I
recommend daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related communications,
some of which may be time-critical. You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating your
e-mail address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564
Contacts: You can contact the Teaching Assistants or me by email, by coming to the office hours, or by
appointment. Email messages received after 10:00 pm will not be answered until the following day.
When contacting your instructor or the Teaching Assistant by email you are expected to address them by
title or name and include your name at the end of the message.
Use of Canvas in Class: Power Point presentations will be uploaded to Canvas after the class.
Electronic equipment: Mobile phones and any other electronic equipment have to be switched off during
class, and tape recorders are not permitted. If you need to use either, please request permission from your
instructor. Students can use laptops in class but only for class related matters. Expect to be asked to show
your laptop and justify its use. No mobile equipment is permitted during tests. Students who violate these
rules will lose their class participation points.
Emergency Evacuation Policy: Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to
evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be
aware of the following policies regarding evacuation: Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the
classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you


entered the building. If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of
class. In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors. Do not re-enter a
building unless the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention
Services office give you instructions to do so.
Notice regarding academic dishonesty: University of Texas Honor Code: The core values of The
University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and
responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity,
honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community. Web site for more information:
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/plagiarism
Student conduct that breaks the Honor Code and includes cheating on exams by copying from a fellow
student or copying lab answers will result, at the minimum on a grade of zero for that lab or test.

conduct/
Religious Holy Days: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least
fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. That notification is absolutely
necessary because if you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to
observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time after the absence.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): If you are worried about someone who is acting differently,
you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another
individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of
Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP),
and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit
http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal
Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides students with qualified
disabilities with academic adjustments to their needs. For more information please visit this site:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd/ or call 471-6259. If you have a disability you must let me know by
the beginning of the second week of class. NO Exceptions.
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: Title IX legislation- Starting January 2, all employees who witness or
receive information about sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that involve a
current student or employee must promptly report the incident to the University’s Title IX Coordinator or
a Deputy Title IX Coordinator. Reports can be made by phone: (512) 471-0419;
email, or online. This means that disclosure to the instructor or the TAs of any incident related to the subject
matters listed above, will result in official reporting.
Grade information: Please do not ask for grades or grade information by email. Information about
grades will only be given in person, or through official means.
