OVERVIEW
Description: Major professional and amateur sports exist today as very large businesses. The rights
to broadcast games, matches, races, and events are sold for billions of dollars and the revenues they
generate underpin the entire sports ecosystem globally. Indeed, the value of many sports properties
are in fact tied almost entirely to their league and local media rights deals. Sports today is a media
business.


                                                                      THE BUSINESS OF SPORTS MEDIA

        The course is designed to provide students with a basic understanding of how the business of
sports media operates both as a business generating revenue and content and as a provider and
disseminator of information, critique, and entertainment. The course will be primarily lecture and
discussion of key topics and issues involved with the business of sports media with various guest
speakers from sports\media entities that have an impact in this area.
        This course will examine the many facets of the business of sports related media including
over the air television, cable, satellite TV, OTT platforms, digital, print, radio, and social media. It
examines the business models that each of these types of media use, the challenges to such models,
the changes that are likely in the future and the impact of such media on sports presentation and
development, professional franchises, colleges and conferences and the consumer. It will trace the
historical development of sports as a social phenomenon and the essential role that media has played
in shaping and building its role in domestic society and international relations.

                                                                      SYLLABUS & COURSE OUTLINE
                                                                                           SPRING 2020
REQUIRED READING MATERIALS
  1. Articles will be posted on Canvas throughout the semester as assigned reading for the class.
  2. Students will also be expected to familiarize themselves with current relevant news and events
     regarding the business sports media as news breaks. As such, it is strongly recommended
     that students read the New York Times, Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal on an
     active basis.
  3. Further, The Sports Business Journal (SBJ) is a mandatory weekly read (starting in
     week 3) and is an invaluable source of current information. Details will be given about SBJ in
     class or in a posted Announcement in Canvas.
  4. The SBJ’s Jon Ourand’s weekly newsletter – you can subscribe with your SBJ subscription
  5. We will begin using SBJ in the third week of class so you must subscribe or have SBJ
     available before your third class. Articles and material of current interest to a topic being
     discussed in class will be assigned periodically throughout the semester and distributed on
     Canvas.
ASSIGNMENTS
  A. Periodic Written Assignments
         a. The specifics of each writing assignment will be discussed in class and on Canvas but
             will generally be focused on current issues\news involving sports media as presented
             in class, a formal business review case study, and/or the current issue of the Sports
             Business Journal. Each assignment will also require the student to consider outside
             sources to perform an analysis of the question presented. Format:
                 i.   These analyses may have different lengths, though none will exceed 750
                      words, maximum, appropriately referenced. Any content over the maximum
                      limit will not be reviewed and the assignment will be graded on the maximum
                      word count only.
                ii.   Students must provide a word count at the conclusion of each
                      question/assignment.
               iii.   Each writing submitted for credit in this class will be judged not only on
                      reasoning and content but on the quality of the writing style and grammar as
                      well.
               iv.    Late assignments may be turned in after discussion with and receipt of the
                      approval of the instructor or the Teaching Assistant.
  B. Case Studies
         a. Case study analysis assignments ask students to evaluate a sports business and
             media issue/challenge within a class topic. Previous case analyses have centered on
             athlete-driven media and Esports.
         b. The assignment is rubric-based, with components including a thesis statement,
             argument and writing style. In addition to a one-page submission, we assign a proposal
             discussion post and outline with peer reviews that provide additional opportunities for
             feedback and development of student skills related to writing as a process.
  C. In Class Quizzes
         a. We will have five (5) periodic Quizzes in Class dealing with assigned readings and SBJ
             weekly readings. Notice will not normally be given of such quizzes. Additional
             details to be discussed in class.


                                                                     THE BUSINESS OF SPORTS MEDIA
                                                                             ADV 348S, PR 348S, J 348G
                                                                        SYLLABUS & COURSE OUTLINE
                                                                                             SPRING 2020
    D. Testing
            a. The goal in this class is for students to learn the mechanics, operations and business
                principles of sports media. Many of the topics are industry-specific and require students
                to learn concepts to a detailed level AND provide analysis of current business
                situations. As such, our goal is to provide a testing environment that allows students to
                properly compose their answers and evidence they know the material. Therefore, in
                class testing WILL NOT BE TIMED – stay until you finish. Students will not be
                assessed on material covered in the same session as exams.
            b. Test (Definitional). Early class content covers historical context and the mechanics of
                broadcasting, cable, satellite, etc. These straightforward “Definitional” concepts will be
                tested early in the semester and provide an opportunity to form a solid baseline grade
                in the class.
            c. Mid Term Exam (Definitional + Analytical). It will consist of a number of some
                combination of multiple choice, true\false, short answer and similar type questions and
                will cover material assigned and lectures given through the date of the exam.
            d. Final Exam (Definitional + Analytical) – Held during the last class of the Semester. It
                will consist of a number of some combination of multiple choice, true\false, short
                answer and similar type questions and will cover material assigned and lectures given
                through the entire semester.
            e. The Final Take Home Questions. Students will be asked to draw upon the various
                course readings, case studies, SBJ articles and other material used or assigned and in
                class discussions and lectures to express an understanding of a topic or topics
                involving the business of sports media. The final assignment will be multiple questions,
                each with a maximum of 300 words, appropriately referenced. The standards set out
                above for Periodic Written Assignments shall apply here as well.
    E. Extra credit
            a. Extra credit lectures or other extra credit opportunities may be available and will be
                posted and\ or discussed in class.
    F. Participation
            a. Online and in-class activities may be assigned at the discretion of the instructor. Any
                remaining, unused points may be redistributed to another point total and will be shared
                before the assessment.
Grading and Evaluation:
        Grading is cumulative throughout the semester. Every point counts toward the final grade.
Individual assessment will be based on attainment of up to 100 points with the number of points
assigned to each means of grading and method of evaluation as listed below. These points may be
modified slightly over the course of the semester. For example, a point may be added to the Midterm
and a point subtracted from Quizzes.
Point values
        Grades are calculated on full point, .75 point, .5 point and .25 point increments to best reflect
student knowledge of the material in question. Under the plus/minus grading system of the university,
grades will be calculated using accumulated points from graded activities as follows:
        NOTE: DO NOT use the grade calculation function in CANVAS to assess your grade
as it does not take into account the different total point values of each graded item; it only
blends grade averages. To calculate your grade at any point in the class divide your RAW point
total by the total number of RAW points available in graded assignments to date. For example, if

        You accumulate points over the course of the semester by completion of all of the above
graded activities. Maximum points available equal 102 (plus any extra credit). If you miss any of the
graded activities or fail to complete or submit them, the points associated with those activities are
forfeited and as such, will impact your final grade. Due to the built-in 2 point curve and the
opportunity for extra-credit opportunities, grades will not be additionally
bootstrapped/rounded up. (e.g., a final raw point total of 92.7 will not be rounded up to a 93. Based
on the above chart, its an A-).

EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENTIRELY DISCRETIONARY; EXCESSIVE CLASS
ABSENCES OR ANY INDICATION OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY WILL RESULT IN THE
IMMEDIATE ZERO-ING OUT OF ALL POSSIBLE EXTRA CREDIT POINTS IN ADDITION TO ALL
OTHER APPLICABLE PENALTIES.
Attendance:
         Students are expected to attend every class which is critical to the success of the
course. As noted below, a large part of your grade will come from in class activities. Students are
to be prepared to start the class session on time. If for some reason you are unable to attend
class, the student is expected to inform the instructor and the TA via email prior to class.
         Being absent or late for class may result in a reduction of your grade for the course. If a
student misses a class for any reason, it is the responsibility of the student to be informed of the
materials covered during the class. Each student is encouraged to find a “class buddy” who can
share information, handouts, and assignments.
Academic Integrity and Standards:
         Students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity in all
course activities and assignments. It is expected that there shall be no deception regarding the
representation made by the student of his/her preparation, participation, or performance.
         Plagiarism is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgement makes the difference. Plagiarism is
presenting another person’s work as though it is one’s own. Plagiarism is the presentation of a
sequence of words, from another writer, quoted without quotation marks and presented as one’s own
work. It is crucial that acknowledgement of sources be accurate and complete. This includes citations
of all sources on written assignments. The instructor uses various tools to determine if plagiarism has
occurred.
         The remainder of the course requirements and policies relating to cheating and plagiarism are
subject to the standard policies and procedures for all UT-Austin students as established by UT-
Austin.
University of Texas Honor Code:
         The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to
uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.

  Title IX Reporting
        Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual ha
        rassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at feder
        ally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and worki
        ng environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in o
        ur community, the university can:
             1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
                 2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experie
                 nced harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
             3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
        Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “

Important Note re: Class Prep/Readings:
As the sports media industry is currently evolving at lightning speed, we have moved away

that content along with the SBJ readings will all be fair game for tests and quizzes. So please
check in regularly to ensure you are up to date on course prep.
