  American Utopias
  AMS 370 (31165)
  Spring 2020
  Tues/Thurs 12:30-2:00
                                            Instructor: Brendan Gaughen
                                            Office:
What do utopian socialist communities of 150 years ago have to do with the gated suburbs of
today? What salacious things were going on in the Oneida Community in the second half of the
nineteenth century? What are the relationships between physical architecture and social
architecture? Part geography and part intellectual and social history, this course explores some of
the most lasting cultural forces in American thought and practice from the colonial era through
the present – the recurring impulse to form separate societies by those who have believed
society to be irreparably flawed. Paying close attention to historic attempts (and mostly failures)
to create “perfect” social, spiritual, and physical communities both real and imagined, this course
investigates ideas about society, inclusion and exclusion, and American exceptionalism, finding
that these communities tell us as much about the beliefs of their adherents as they do about
prevailing attitudes and values at various points in American history.
This course uses a variety of primary and secondary texts spanning the colonial era to the
postmodern era to critically investigate historical ideas about community, landscape, nature,
property, family, labor, society, optimism, perfection, and other concepts that have influenced
the development of America and facilitated the creation and maintenance of various
communities within.
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly
during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your
instructor to help you improve your writing. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of
your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications
objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility,
established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. This course also carries the
Independent Inquiry flag.
                                            COURSE GOALS
This course has three principal content-based objectives:
1) Greater understanding of how and why certain people have mapped ideas about optimism and
perfection onto the American landscape and society and why others chose to attempt to
withdraw and form their own communities.


2) Greater understanding of how varying perspectives and ideas shape the remembering and
retelling of particular episodes of American history.
3) Greater understanding of the plurality of viewpoints and experiences of ordinary people at
various points in American history.
In addition to learning about the social conditions that gave rise to certain communities, this
course has three skills-based objectives that you will develop over the course of the semester.
These skills will not only be useful during your academic career, but are essential in the workplace
and to the development of an active, informed, and engaged citizenry. These include:
1) Writing skills. You will practice cogently crafting an argument based on specific evidence and
how to respond to counter arguments. You will also practice crafting clear thesis statements and
organizing an argument effectively.
2) Close reading and analysis. You will practice how to interrogate and analyze texts that carry
specific and often oblique messages to their audiences.
3) Synthesizing the research of other scholars. You will be asked to locate an author’s main
claims, identify their evidence and perspective, and present your findings to the class in the form
of leading discussion.
                                            COURSE POLICIES
        Readings. Purchase the course reader, available at Jenn’s Copies at 2518 Guadalupe St. I
encourage each of you to be active readers and interact with the texts by underlining,
highlighting, and engaging with the texts as you see fit. Please bring the reader to class each day
ready to discuss the assigned text, ideally with specific questions or talking points in mind. It
should go without saying that in a discussion-based course, showing up to class having done the
reading is essential. Always check with the syllabus (and/or announcements on Canvas) before
proceeding through the course reader.
        Attendance. This class is discussion-oriented so attendance is imperative. Missing an
excess of five class days will result in a zero participation grade. Explained absences for religious
holidays, sanctioned travel related to sports or military service, or other absences you can plan in
advance will not necessarily count against you if at least one week’s notice is given. Unforeseen
absences, such as illness or family emergency, may be excused once proper documentation is
provided, at my discretion. This policy will begin on Tuesday, February 4.
        Office hours. I strongly encourage each of you to come to office hours at least once
(preferably more) during the semester so you can get the most out of the course. This is an
opportunity for you to discuss assignment expectations, difficult aspects of the readings, and seek
feedback on your written work before you turn it in. Or just come by to say hello to talk about
music or something.
        Devices. I strongly suggest that you take notes by hand rather than with a computer or
table. Numerous scientific studies have shown that people remember things better when they’ve
taken handwritten notes. Laptops and tablets in class must be silent and may not be used for any
reason other than course-related material. I trust you will all use technology responsibly, but
failure to abide by this policy may result in the revocation of in-class laptop/tablet privileges.
        Communication and assignments. Course-related announcements, relevant or interesting
links, and other important information will be sent to you via email, so please check your email at


least once per day. All emails sent to me will be responded to within 24 hours of receipt unless
unforeseen circumstances arise. A copy of this syllabus, specific instructions for assignments, and
announcements will be posted to the course Canvas site.
         Late work. Late work will receive a deduction of one letter grade per class day past the
due date. Extensions will not be granted unless under extraordinary circumstances.
         Written assignments. All assignments must be typed with 1-inch margins and 12 point
font. Use a standard citation style (e.g. Chicago Style, MLA) to cite your sources when applicable.
All papers must be turned in at the beginning of class on their respective due dates. Given this
course’s writing requirements, I encourage you to take advantage of the free resources of the
Undergraduate Writing Center (PCL 2.330; uwc.utexas.edu).
         Changes to the syllabus. I may slightly modify the course schedule, assigned readings, and
due dates as I see fit. You will be alerted to these changes in class and/or via Canvas.
         Students with disabilities. Any student with a documented disability who requires
academic accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at 512-
471-6259 (voice) or 866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty members are not required to provide
accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.
         Academic honesty. In an effort to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and integrity in
the classroom, cheating and plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. Such actions will result in
an automatic zero for the assignment and may be reported to the Dean of Students for further
disciplinary action. University policies regarding academic honesty are available at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php.
