                       Atlantic Slavery: History and Memory
                                             Thompson
                                              Fall 2018
Course Description:
What would it mean to consider the emergence of a United States national identity (and other
national identities) from the perspective of the intersecting trade routes and shifting imperial
projects constituting what scholars have called the Atlantic World? What would it mean to
consider the emergence of global capitalism through the particular lens of the transatlantic slave
trade and the diversity of labor and production regimes it spawned? This course places the
overarching processes of domination and dehumanization arrayed on behalf of European and US
empire and against African peoples alongside the various sites of struggle and resistance in
which people of African descent articulated and enacted visions of freedom. In doing so, it
details how the conditions for a politicized black diasporic identity have emerged from contexts
of cultural and linguistic diversity among African-descended populations. This course charts a
history of Atlantic slavery by focusing on primary sources detailing crucial events and contexts
such as the Zong Massacre (1791); the Haitian Revolution (1804); and the Amistad Revolt
(1839) among others. It also considers how historians, memoirists, fiction writers, visual and
performance artists and filmmakers have come to terms with that history and its implications,
especially regarding the moral, political, and economic investments nations and empires have
made in the commodification of human beings.

This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
This course carries the Writing flag. Writing flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write
regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback
from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity


to revise one or more assignments, and to read and discuss your peers' work. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work.
Written Projects: Because this course carries a writing flag, I expect students to pay particular
attention to the quality of their written work. I have assigned three short papers and one longer
paper. Please use the short papers as occasions to hone your technical skills, taking advantage of
the short length to practice making succinct arguments and supporting them in a well-focused
way.
Final grades will be assigned on a plus/minus basis where A: 93 and above; A-: 90-92.99;
B+: 87-89.99; B: 83-86.99; B-: 80-82.99; C+: 77-79.99; C: 73-76.99; C-: 70-72.99; D+: 67-
69.99; D: 63-66.99; D-: 60-62.99; F: 59.99 and below
Paper Format: Papers must be typed, double-spaced, in 12-point Times New Roman font with
one-inch margins.
Make-Up Policy: Extensions on the graded assignments will be granted only in the case of a
medical or family emergency, or if you have official, documented University of Texas business
(including intercollegiate athletics) outside of campus. You must notify me before the due date;
failure to do so will result in the automatic subtraction of a letter grade. Assignments turned in
late without an excuse will lose one letter grade for each day past the due date.
Preparation and participation: This class is reading-intensive. I will help you prioritize by
indicating from class to class which readings are most essential, and I will try to prepare you for
some of the most challenging readings. Try to get an early start on each of the longer texts; do
NOT try to read them in their entirety the night before the discussion classes. Come to class
prepared with questions! These questions should not be of the “yes or no” or hypothetical
variety. Their aim should be to open up conversation about the reading. The success of this
course depends on your prepared-ness and your active participation! Please don’t let each other
down! Failure to contribute in some way will significantly impact your grade.
Civility: Much of our class time will be spent in discussion. Therefore it is important that we
show respect for each other by being attentive and polite. I encourage spirited debate but expect
that we will be civil in all our discussions. Class will begin promptly at 3:30. Please be on
time—late arrivals distract discussants.
Academic Dishonesty includes but is not limited to cheating; plagiarism (the appropriation of
another’s work and unauthorized incorporation of that work in one’s own written work offered
for credit); and collusion (the unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing
college work offered for credit). These acts will be subject to academic penalties.
Special Needs Policy: Any student with a documented disability (physical or cognitive) who
requires academic accommodations should contact the Services for Students with Disabilities
area of the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259 (voice) or 471-4641 (TTY for users who
are deaf or hard of hearing) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized
accommodations.
