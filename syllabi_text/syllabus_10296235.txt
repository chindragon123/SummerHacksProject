Course Description
Dybbuks, golems, evil eye are just some of the more
well-known aspects of Jewish folklore, but
this course will also examine the folklife of the Jews,
their world view, their folk beliefs and fears. Call it folk
religion if you will; many of these practices were
dismissed by the "official" Jewish religion as unJewish,
but the "folk" persisted and eventually the practice
became Judaized and accepted. There are no
prerequisites for the class.
Using literary sources, ethnographic memoirs,
historical documents, films (among them "The Dybbuk"
1939), folkore collections and field trips (among them
- to the oldest Austin Jewish cemetery), we will focus


on what makes Jewish folklore Jewish and look at
various folklore genres -folktale, legend, folksong, folk
music, custom, belief and, of course, Jewish humor will
be included.
Students will be required to do the assigned reading
and complete two short (2 - 4 pages) papers and one
final longer paper( 5 - 7 pages). In the first paper the
student will interview a Jewish senior citizen on his
folkways ; in the second short paper each student
analyze a book or film exemplifying Jewish humor. The
third paper will examine how modern literature and art
have used traditional Jewish folklore . The final paper
(5 - 7 pages) will be on a topic to be determined by
student and will be in two parts: a first draft and a final
paper. There will be a midterm.
First paper due February 5
Second paper due March 24
First draft of final paper May 8
Final paper due May 13
