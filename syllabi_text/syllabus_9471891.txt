                                 ANT384M Ceramic Analysis
Unique no.: 31795
Spring 2019
Instructor: Enrique Rodríguez
Wednesdays 2:00-5:00
Classroom: SAC 5.124
Office hours: Mondays and Fridays 11:00-12:00, and by appointment
Office: SAC 4.144
        In this course we will learn basic techniques of ceramic analysis for
archaeological research, and examine different aspects of ceramic production, exchange,
use, and discard using a variety of archaeological and ethnographic sources. Ceramics
make up the bulk of archaeological artifacts and are frequently used to make inferences
about past economies, social relations, political life, and cultural practice. We will learn
basic macroscopic analysis of ceramics and the theoretical background needed to bridge
from artifacts to social life in the past.
        The course will be a combination of seminar and laboratory analysis. Throughout
the semester we will discuss a broad range of literature on ceramics, touching upon issues
of technology, chemical characterization, decoration, and ethnoarchaeological research
on contemporary ceramic producers. In the lab portion of the class we will learn basic
ceramic characterization techniques, including surface description, analysis of the paste,
ceramic typologies, photography, drawing, and others. Successful completion of the
class will depend upon student participation in class discussion, completion of laboratory
assignments, an annotated bibliography on a specific topic related to ceramic analysis,
and a book review or a term paper.
Students with disabilities: Any student with disabilities should talk to me as soon as
possible so that we may make arrangements that will make for a better learning
experience and that will allow the student to show his or her abilities fully.
Assignments:
        Attendance and participation are required, as is, of course, completion of readings
before class. In each class, we will discuss the readings and begin the laboratory
assignments for the week. The difficulty of different lab assignments will vary each
week, as will, of course, the amount of time necessary for completing the labs. Students
will have access to their respective collections for the rest of the week. Each student will
be responsible for the ceramic collection assigned to him or her. Penalties for losing,
stealing, damaging, or destroying sherds might include an F in the class and other
academic penalties.
        There will be two main written assignments. The first will be an annotated
bibliography of 8 to 10 sources on a specific methodological problem or technique in
ceramic analysis. Students must discuss their topic with the instructor in office hours for
                                              1


approval. Students will also present this assignment in class in a 15 minute presentation.
The second written assignment will be a longer paper, 12 to 15 pages, and students will
have a choice of the following topics:
        A) An analysis of ceramics using primary data from their own excavations or
            field project.
        B) A book review of an ethnoarchaeology monograph related to ceramics, or of
            an archaeology book on ceramic analysis, and a proposal of how to continue
            and expand the research.
        C) A proposal for future empirical research with an archaeological ceramic
            collection.
All students must discuss their topics with the instructor, and all topics must be approved
by the instructor. The discussion must be in person, and not over email. There can be no
last minute changes. Other details of the assignments will be explained in class during
the semester.
Grades will be determined as follows:
        Participation:                                 20%
        Lab assignments (8):                           40%
        Annotated bibliography:                        15%
        Final paper:                                   15%
        In-class presentation:                         10%
Readings:
Three books that I recommend purchasing for this class are:
Arnold, Dean E. 2018 Maya Potters’ Indigenous Knowledge: Cognition, Engagement,
        and Practice. The University Press of Colorado, Boulder.
        (appears in the syllabus as “Arnold, Maya Potters”)
Rice, Prudence 2006 Pottery Analysis: A Sourcebook. University of Chicago Press.
        (appears in the syllabus as “Rice, Pottery Analysis”)
Orton, Clive, Paul Tyers, and Alan Vince 1993 Pottery in Archaeology. Cambridge
        Manuals in Archaeology. Cambridge University Press.
        (appears in the syllabus as “Orton et al., Pottery in Archaeology”)
        We will read most of Arnold, Maya Potters, so I recommend purchasing it for
class. The library owns an electronic copy. Although we will only read a couple of
chapters from Orton et al., and from Rice’s Pottery Analysis, I recommend purchasing
them as reference books. They will be handy as reference materials throughout the
semester.

Most of the other readings are on reserve at the PCL. Readings that are marked as “On
