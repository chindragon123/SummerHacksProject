           Unique 02669              12:30 pm – 02:00 pm TT in CBA4.330
Course            The course examines issues in financial reporting from both preparer and user perspectives. The basic
Objectives        objectives of the course are:
(1) to learn about current GAAP financial reporting.
(2) to consider the economics of transactions and events, and understand whether and how financial reporting captures those
    economics. This way of thinking lays the foundation for understanding how equity and credit analysts use financial reports.
    This way of thinking also allows you to learn about business (i.e., broadens your thinking beyond just debits and credits).
(3) to learn how to reason about financial reporting problems in a forward direction, similar to what preparers normally do (i.e.,
    work forward from the data to journal entry to financial statement) and to learn how to reason about financial reporting
    problems in a backward direction, similar to what financial report users do (i.e., work backward from financial statement and
    footnote data to journal entry).

COURSE MATERIALS
TEXT: INTERMEDIATE ACCOUNTING, by Kieso, Weygandt, and Warfield, 2019, 17                             th edition. Available for purchase at Co-Op.
in loose-leaf form. You can also try to find cheaper options – Wiley.com offers $54 e-book rental for 150 days: https://www.wiley.com/en-
us/Intermediate+Accounting%2C+17th+Edition-p-9781119503682. Or go to Wiley.com, then in the search box type “Intermediate
Accounting 17 e”, it will lead you to the above link.
CLASS NOTES & OLD EXAM QUESTIONS: These are essential, cannot-do-without
class notes. Bring the relevant parts to class each day. The class notes will be available for purchase at Jenn’s Copy &
Binding (http://www.jennscopies.com/), 2518 Guadalupe. These notes contain three components (1) my class notes, (2) the
"Additional Problems in Class Notes" indicated on the assignment sheet, and (3) my old exams at the end of the packet.
The class notes will be your PRIMARY source of studying the topics covered in this course.
SOLUTIONS TO ADDITONAL PROBLEMS: This packet contains the solutions to the
unassigned additional homework problems. It does not include those to be turned in for course credit. (Solutions to the latter
problems will be available on Canvas.)
Available for purchase at Jenn’s Copy & Binding, 2518 Guadalupe (Dean Keaton & Guadalupe).
The above two packets (Class Notes and Solution Manual) cost approximately $42 total.
The three primary sources of studying topics in this course are: class notes, solution packet to (unassigned) homework problems
(see above), and the textbook. Previous students have indicated that they rely very heavily on the class notes and the additional
HW problem solution packet to study for exams. You are encouraged to use the textbook as a reference tool or a starting point;
read excerpts from the textbook as necessary. However, spending time reading every word in the textbook would not be productive
for several reasons: (1) we cover the topics very quickly in class and there is not much to spend reading the textbook, (2) the
textbook contains many accounting details that are not that important (and will not show up on exams), (3) the textbook forces
students to think only about current GAAP; many aspects of this course involve thinking about alternative perspectives, some of
which are not GAAP, and (4) some important topics are not discussed in the textbook. For topics you’ve never been exposed to
before (such as derivatives), reading the notes and related sections in the textbook before class can prove very valuable. Reading
the textbook on an as-needed basis can save you valuable time and maximize efficiency. DO WHAT WORKS BEST FOR YOU.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:                                             Your course fees allow us to purchase a site license to the FASB standards.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS
   EXAMS: There will be two mid-term exams and one final exam.                  With the exception of the final exam, each exam will
   only cover the materials in that portion of the course, with the following important exception: statement of cash flows and
   deferred taxes will be covered in all three exams.
   For each of the three exams, you can bring a 4 x 6 inch index card “cheat sheet.” Writing/typing on both sides is acceptable.
   HOMEWORK: There will be 13 homework assignments.                       These homework assignments help you stay up to date on
   the material (it’s easy to let things slide and somewhat disastrous in this class if you do). Solutions to these assigned homework
   problems will be made available on 5:00pm on the Canvas course website.
   Homework is to be turned in using course the Assignment Link on course Canvas site. All homework is due by 5:00pm on
   Canvas site on due date. Since I release the solution to assigned homework problems by 5:00pm on the due date, no late
   homework will be accepted.
   CASES: There will be two case assignments – they are done in four person groups. These cases are based on real
   world situations and are designed to help you solve unstructured problems that require searching accounting standards. While
   textbook and exam questions have one ‘right’ answer, the real world cases usually do not have one right answer and are
   therefore more challenging. Part of your training in this class is to help you tackle unstructured, no-single-right-answer
   situations that are more reflective of the real world.
   I will post the cases assigned about two weeks before they are due in the “Course Documents” link on Canvas class website.
   Your case write-up should describe alternative solutions, cite references to relevant accounting standards, precedents, etc., and
   recommend a course of actions. Solutions to group cases are limited to four single-spaced, single-sided typed pages (two
   pages if double-sided). You can attach your supporting documents to your group reports, such as Excel worksheet, in an
   Appendix attached to your reports.
   On Friday 9/6, my case TA Mandy Ellison (mandy.ellison@austin.utexas.edu) will assign you to project groups consisting of 4
   students to work on the projects. Mandy may assign you to work with students in the other sections that I am teaching.
COURSE GRADES
   Course grades are determined by the following weighting scheme:
      Exam 1                          220 points      22%
      Exam 2                          250 points      25%
      Final Exam                      290 points      29%
      Homework                        100 points      10%
      Team cases                      140 points      14%
      TOTAL POINTS                  1,000 points     100%

DETAILS ON GRADING
EXAMS: Exams are problem based and so we do assign partial credits. To the extent we can tell that you made a pure math
mistake (i.e., you wrote $10 x 5000 units = $5,000), we do not take points off. Hence, showing your work is important!
I grade on a curve based on all four sections I am teaching this semester.
No make-up exams will be given. Medical emergencies and family emergencies are the only valid reasons that will be accepted for
missing an exam. You must provide supporting documentation (e.g., signed note from a physician) if you do miss an exam. If you
are excused from an exam, the other two exams will be re-weighted (e.g., if you miss the first exam, the second and final exams will
be re-weighted). If you miss two exams, you automatically fail this course and no re-weighting will be granted. If you do not have a
valid reason for missing an exam, you will receive a zero on the exam, which usually implies failing the course.
HOMEWORK: Unless otherwise noted, the homework will be graded on an effort, and not accuracy, basis.                   Homework is
scored on a 0, 1, 2, 3 basis. You will receive full credit for a problem if the grader concludes that you made a reasonable effort.
I will drop the two lowest homework scores in calculating your final grade. Homework solutions are made available on the course
Canvas website at 5:00 p.m. on the homework due date. Homework is considered late (score of 0) if received after 5:00 p.m. on
the due date (no exceptions).
To turn in your homework, please save your work into PDF files or WORD files, and upload them onto the course Canvas page. Go
to the home page, click on the link “Assignments”, you will be taken to a platform where you can upload your files.
We do not accept paper copies of turned in homework anymore – this allows faster response from TAs after grading and makes
redistribution of your HW instantaneous.
CASE: Cases will be graded on a relative basis (i.e., your case relative to other teams’ cases). When grading, we are looking for
coherent and logical arguments that can support your proposed solution.
How do I deal with the free-rider problem on these cases? At the end of each case, each group member will provide a confidential
evaluation of him/herself and the other group members. The peer evaluation forms are already posted on Canvas site – click the
“Course Documents” link to download. Fill out the peer evaluation forms and turn these printed-out forms in to me on the due date
of the cases (September 27 and December 6, respectively). I will put out a collection box for these forms in the accounting
department office to collect them.
I encourage you to write your notes down immediately after each case instead of waiting till the last minute. I will consider this
information and make any necessary adjustments to the case grade for specific individuals in the team (e.g., a group member who
provides little help on the cases will get a deduction from the grade on the cases). The maximum downward adjustment is the
earned score on the cases.
REGRADING POLICY: My team of TAs and I will make every effort to ensure the accuracy of grading. Should grading
discrepancies arise (e.g., not adding up your points correctly, etc.), you must submit a TYPED-UP, WRITTEN request for re-
grading, on one page, and turn in your written request along with your exam within 2 calendar days (48 hours) after the exams
are given back to you.


SYLLABUS ACC 380K.1 Professor Chen -- Fall 2019                                                                      Page 5 of 14
STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
I. GETTING OFF TO A SOLID START:
    I would highly recommend that those of you who feel in any way nervous about your skills at making journal entries to read
    carefully through Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of the textbook before or during the first week of the class and work on the problems
    assigned in HW #1a – see Page 10 for details on assignment.
II. CLASS ATTENDANCE AND HOMEWORK:
    In my opinion, class attendance and homework are the two most important components of this course. Why?
    Reason #1: There is a lot of material in ACC 380K.1 and the course moves quickly. If you miss class, you will typically spend at
    least triple the class time to learn the materials on your own. Trying to figure out on your own some of the course material
    is just too tough. Maximizing in-class learning is the most efficient way to learn the materials.
    Reason #2: Much of what I cover in class is not in the textbook.
    If, for some reason, you have to miss class, I recommend that you obtain the class notes from someone else and, if possible,
    also have them audio record the class. It’s an easy way to ensure that you can get up to speed on the material you missed.
    Reason #3: Since the content of ACC380k.1 is largely problem oriented, doing the homework problems on a timely basis is a
    must for good performance. Exam performance is directly related to systematic preparation, which includes timely completion
    of the homework assignments.
    There are homework problems from the textbook and in my class notes. What is the difference? Problems in the class notes
    supplement the textbook when the textbook is deficient in a particular type of problem. So you should view the two as
    complements and not substitutes. If you don’t do all of the problems for a particular topic, be sure to scan all problems and
    make sure you get coverage on all types of problems/subtopics within a particular topic.
III. USE THE RESOURCES PROVIDED:
CANVAS: The course Canvas site will be an integral part of my teaching tool and your learning tool.
        Solutions to homework that is turned in for credit will be available on Canvas on due date by due time.
        Discussion index is available on Canvas. The TA’s and I will monitor these discussion groups to provide timely answers to
        questions. The only kind of question you should not post on Canvas are case-related questions as those need to be privately
        communicated to me or the case TA via email (you don’t want to give away your case insights on Canvas!).
        Corrections to homework solutions will be posted on the announcement portion of Canvas for the course. I’ll label them as
        MAJOR and MINOR depending on their severity.
Privacy in Canvas: Information in Canvas is protected by your UTEID login. Please be aware that I will use a merged Canvas site
for all sections of the course that I am teaching this semester. This will allow students in other sections to see that you are enrolled
in the course and send you email from within Canvas. However, they will not actually learn your email address and no other
personal data will be revealed through Canvas. If you have any concerns, please contact the ITS Help Desk at 475-9400 for help
removing your name from view of other students.
    TA’S:          I have hand-picked the TA’s because (1) they have taken the class previously, (2) they are bloody smart, and (3)
    they are eager to help you too.

IV. THINKING LIKE A BUSINESS PERSION:
  Your in-class understanding of the accounting issues will be much enhanced if you train yourself at the same time to think like a
  business person. In a lot of topics we cover, such as derivatives transactions, a solid understanding of the underlying business
  transactions is a must before you tackle the accounting issues. Understanding the business transactions and the business
  environment are also important for fulfilling our class objectives, i.e., understanding the economics of the transactions and
  reasoning backward from the financial statements to infer firms’ performance.
  Where do you start? One great starting point is to acquire knowledge about what is going on in the business world. Thus, I
  encourage you to get access to a business publication and to read it on a regular basis. I realize that time is a scarce commodity
  but even a little bit of reading here and there is much better than no reading. I recommend:
          1.  The Wall Street Journal. It’s THE newspaper of business.
          2.  Financial Times. It’s equivalent to the international version of Wall Street Journal.
          3.  Fortune. It comes out every couple of weeks and has longer and more in-depth articles.
          4.  Forbes.
          5.  The Economist.
          6.  Business Week.
          7.  Barron’s
OTHER
    Academic accommodation for students with disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate
    academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of
    Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY, http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd.
    Religious holy Days: Per university policy, you must notify me of an absence related to a religious holy day observance no later
    than 14 days prior to the observance of that holy day. If your religious holy day falls on one of the exam dates, I will reschedule
    you to take a ‘make-up’ exam before the class exam date.


SYLLABUS ACC 380K.1 Professor Chen -- Fall 2019                                                                    Page 7 of 14
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
The Department of Accounting is making a concerted effort to focus students’ attention on their professional conduct. Why? We are
the #1 program in the country, but this ranking can easily be undermined by a lack of professional conduct.
Developing and protecting the value of a McCombs MPA degree influences everything I do and should influence your behavior as
well. The McCombs MPA brand will open doors for you, but it does not provide you with entitlements. You will still have to earn the
benefits of being branded as a McCombs MPA. This of course will also ensure that your degree reflects well on you and your fellow
graduates throughout your careers.
      What does it mean to be professional? Behaving with the highest level of integrity, respect for others, and ethics. Stand
      by your word, make good decisions, and take responsibility for your actions. Show courtesy and respect for the views and times
      of your fellow students and to faculty, TA’s, program directors, and staff. In turn, we will show you the same.
For this class
Professional behavior is not only required when interacting with someone outside of the university environment, but it also is
expected in your classes and in situations related to this class. Therefore:
1. I expect you to attend the section in which you are enrolled. If there is a particular reason that you must miss class (e.g.,
only time you could get for a doctor’s appointment), please let me know of your need to attend the other section before that class
meeting. If there is a last-minute emergency, call me in my office and let me know.
2. I expect students to arrive to class on time. It is very disruptive to the class when a student enter the classroom after class
has begun, as it interrupts the flow of the lecture/discussion and distracts the other students.
3. I expect that all electronic devices will be turned off once class begins. Laptops, cell phones, pagers, Blackberries, and
other communication devices are to be turned completely off (including turning off “cell phone vibrate mode” during class time.) I
expect that reading of non-class materials will stop once class starts.
4. I expect students to not take personal breaks during class. Of course from time to time a student must leave class for one
important reason or another, but students leaving and returning during class is very disruptive, so please keep these disturbances to
an absolute minimum.
5. I expect that you will not have conversations or write notes back and forth with other students during class.
6. I expect that you will be respectful of me, my team of TA’s, and of the other students in class and in office hours.
7. I expect you to be diligent in working with your teams for the case assignments and to be a team player, not a problem
member.
8. I expect you to be responsible for getting the course notes and in-class handouts on any day that you must miss class. It is
not my responsibility to secure missed material for you.
In return, you can expect me and my team of TA’s to:
1. Be in class and office hours on time.
2. Be respectful of your need to learn the material in this class. Thus, we will provide timely and enthusiastic responses to
questions made in person or on Canvas and keep you up to date on changes in the syllabus or homework solutions, again on a
timely basis. You can expect us to return homework, cases, and exams in a timely fashion to enhance your learning experience.
3. Be courteous to you in our interactions with you in and outside of class.
4. Provide you with an education that will prepare you well for the long-term.

                                       Departmental Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both students
and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the department’s Policy Statement on
Scholastic Dishonesty in the MPA Program. By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all of the faculty
responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all of the student
responsibilities described in that document. If the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments
is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
                       Application of Departmental Policy to Writing Assignments in this Course
CASES
Each team’s case solution should be independently prepared. Each team should not refer to other students, other
team’s solutions, or to solutions prepared in previous semesters. All questions on cases are to be directed to me or the
case TA for my sections. Violation of this policy will be treated as an act of “scholastic dishonesty.” Evidence of non-
independent work will be forwarded to the Dean of Students with a recommendation that a grade of “F” be assigned in
the course.
GRADED HOMEWORK
Working on the homework assignments with other students who are currently enrolled in ACC 380K.1 is permitted (and
encouraged). However, merely copying the work of another student who has previously completed the homework
assignment is not permitted. Copying homework solutions from the solutions manual, another instructors’ solution
packet, a previous semesters’ solution packet, or any other source also is not permitted. Violation of this policy will be
treated as an act of “scholastic dishonesty.” Evidence of violation of this policy will be forwarded to the Dean of Students
with a recommendation that a grade of “F” be assigned in the course.
EXAMS
Each student is expected to independently complete the exams during the designated exam period. Each student
should not refer to other students’ exam solutions or discuss the exam with other students during the exam period.
Violation of this policy will be treated as an act of “scholastic dishonesty.” Evidence of non-independent work will be
forwarded to the Dean of Students with a recommendation that a grade of “F” be assigned in the course.

***Final exam date TBD: I will schedule a common exam in December. The university’s scheduling for final common
exam does not start till mid-November. I will announce final exam date in class and also post the date on Canvas class
website once I am informed of the final exam schedule. Since this year’s exam interval starts later than previous years’,
make sure you make travel plans accordingly, i.e., depart AFTER you have attended your final exam, which can be as
late as December 18.
REQUESTs FOR TAKING THE FINAL EXAM EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED WILL                        NOT BE ACCOMMODATED.

         PREPARATION: READ PAGES 16-3~16-9 FROM TEXTBOOK. PAGES 16-58~16-61 OF THE TEXTBOOK TALK ABOUT HOW
         BIFURCATION OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT WORKS. THE TEXT TALKS ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF IFRS WHERE CONVERTIBLE
         DEBT IS ALWAYS BIFURCATED. BUT THE GENERAL DISCUSSION WILL BE HELPFUL FOR OUR DISCUSSION OF US GAAP IN
         THOSE CASES WHERE IT IS BIFURCATED. SO WHY DOESN’T THE TEXT JUST TALK ABOUT THIS BIFURCATION CONCEPT IN
         THE CASE OF US GAAP? THE TEXTBOOK IS NOT QUITE RIGHT WHEN IT SAYS US GAAP DOES NOT BIFURCATE
         CONVERTIBLE DEBT– UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES (CASH SETTLEMENT OPTION), IT IS BIFURCATED.
