Abstract
        An introduction to rapid prototyping techniques for game development. This course will consist of
        rapid creation and iteration of ideas and content related to game mechanics. Projects will
        typically be 1-3 weeks and emphasize the need for practical and functional art, audio, and code to
        convey the concept or topic.
Prerequisites
        AET 310 and AET 318 are required prerequisites for this course. In addition, students should be
        comfortable working in a game engine such as Unity (typically covered in the two classes above).
Assessment
        Assignments for this class will consist of 8 projects worth 10% each. The remaining 20% will be
        based on attendance and professionalism.
        No late work will be accepted. If you feel you will not be able to complete all work on time, you
        should ask the instructor for a grade of Q or drop before the deadline.
        Unless otherwise stated in class, group projects will receive one grade shared by all team
        members, except in circumstances where teammate issues are discussed with the instructor prior
        to submitting the assignment. Teams will be expected to meet and work together outside of
        class. Be prepared to schedule 2-5 hours per week outside of class for team meetings and
        collaboration.
        Note: If you cannot attend class for any reason, please send an email and attach any class
        work as needed, and talk to your classmates to find out what you missed.
Learning Outcomes
        Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to create quick, functional
        prototypes of game mechanics, including functional art, sound, and code. Students will also be
        able to work collaboratively to create a shared vision with teammates. These skills will benefit
        students in their future collaborative projects as well as preparing them for a career in game
        development.

Grades
8 Prototypes: 10% each
Attendance and Professionalism: 20%
Bonus: 1% for each project published at the end of the semester, up to 8% in total
Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric. Please note: to ensure
fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will
be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not recognize the grade
of A+.
A = 94-100
A- = 90-93
B+ = 87-89
B = 84-86
B- = 80-83
C+ = 77-79
C = 74-76
C- = 70-73
D+ = 67-69
D = 64-66
D- = 60-63
F = 0-60
                                                                                                     3


Class Attendance Policy
As detailed above, attending class during the scheduled meeting times earns professionalism credit.
Credit is NOT earned for arriving late, leaving early, or failing to attend class meetings. If attending a
scheduled class meeting is not possible, students are expected to promptly notify the instructor of
extenuating circumstances.
Q Drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six
(6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:“Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher
education may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including
any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student
shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
University Attendance Policy: Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date
of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a
project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed
work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD)
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities
(512-471-6259, ssd@austin.utexas.edu, http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/, or videophone 512-471-6644).
Please provide documentation of your needs during the first week of class, if possible, so that I can make
the necessary accommodations promptly.
Academic Integrity
The University's Honor Code states that “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide
by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” You are expected to maintain
absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in scholastic work undertaken at the University.
At a minimum, you should complete any assignments, exams, and other scholastic endeavors with the
utmost honesty, which requires you to:
     ● acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts;
     ● complete your assignments independently unless expressly authorized to seek or obtain
         assistance in preparing them;
     ● follow instructions for assignments and exams, and observe the standards of your academic
         discipline;
     ● and avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another student.
(adapted from ​http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php​)
Academic Dishonesty
In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines academic dishonesty
as including any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved academic advantage, such as:
     ● Cheating
     ● Plagiarism
     ● Unauthorized Collaboration / Collusion
     ● Falsifying Academic Records
                                                                                                            4


     ●    Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain an extended
          deadline for an assignment, or even gain an unearned financial benefit)
     ● Multiple submissions (submitting essentially the same written assignment for two courses without
          authorization to do so)
     ● Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity
(adapted from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php)
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.

Plagiarism
“Plagiarism” includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining by
any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source, including words, ideas,
illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting that material as
one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program course requirement
(from Sec. 11-402,
http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-conduct/).

Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a
fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding
evacuation: • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that
the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building. • If you require
assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class. • In the event of an
evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless you’re
given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention
Services office.

UT Electronic Mail Notification Policy
Electronic mail (e-mail) is a mechanism for official University and instructor communication to students.
Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with
University- and course-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be
time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week.
It is the responsibility of every student to keep the University and instructor informed of changes in his or
her official e-mail address (do so at https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/bio/address_change.WBX).
Consequently, e-mail returned to the University with "User Unknown" is not an acceptable excuse for
missed communication. Similarly, undeliverable messages returned because of a full inbox or use of a
spam filter will be considered delivered without further action required of the University or instructor.
