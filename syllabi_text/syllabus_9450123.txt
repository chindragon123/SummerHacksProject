UT Electronic Mail  Electronic mail (e-mail) is a mechanism for official University and instructor communication to students.
Notification Policy  Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with
                     University- and course-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-
                     critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week.
                    It is the responsibility of every student to keep the University and instructor informed of changes in his or
                     her official e-mail address (do so at https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/bio/address_change.WBX).
                     Consequently, e-mail returned to the University with "User Unknown" is not an acceptable excuse for
                     missed communication. Similarly, undeliverable messages returned because of a full inbox or use of a
                     spam filter will be considered delivered without further action required of the University or instructor.
                    (see http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy)


Use of Class       The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, and homework assignments
Materials          are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the class materials is a violation of federal
                   law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student. Additionally, the sharing of
                   class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a violation of the
                   University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further
                   disciplinary action. This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the
                   purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students.
                   (from https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/coursematerials/Sample+Use+Statement+for+Syllabus)
Attendance         You are allowed three absences for illness or personal reasons; however, you will likely miss points for in-
                   class assignments or activities as a result, and these generally cannot be made up. However, if a serious
                   medical or personal crisis (hospitalization, death in the family, etc.) impacts your attendance, please
                   inform me as soon as possible. In addition, see the exception below for religious holy days.
                   Arriving more than ten minutes late at the beginning of class or after a break, leaving class without
                   permission, and leaving class prior to dismissal for the day all count as being tardy. Three tardies equals
                   an absence. Four absences will lower your course grade by one letter grade. Additional absences may
                   result in failure of the course.
Religious Holidays Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code states that a student shall be excused from attending classes
                   or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including
                   travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized
                   for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the
                   student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy requires students to
                   notify each of their instructors at least fourteen days prior to the date they will be absent from
                   scheduled classes to observe a religious holy day.
                   (from http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/1555_001.pdf)
Classroom          Please observe the following rules during class as a courtesy to fellow students and the instructor.
Etiquette          1) Be on time at the beginning of class and after each break. If you must come in late at the beginning of
                   class, please enter the room and seat yourself as quietly and unobtrusively as possible. And please don’t
                   hold up the entire class by failing to return promptly at the end of an announced break, since often the
                   second part of the class period is when we will engage in group activities.
                   2) Turn off your cell phone’s notification sounds upon entering the classroom. If you forget to do so, and
                   your phone rings, chirps, or vibrates loudly during class, turn it off immediately and discreetly. I reserve
                   the right to penalize repeat offenders by subtracting points from their day’s assignment.
                   3) Don’t distract other students. Everyone benefits from a classroom free of distracting sights, sounds,
                   and smells. If you would like to update your Facebook page, talk to your friends, listen to loud music,
                   polish your nails, doodle with Sharpies, etc., please do so outside the classroom during breaks.
                   4) Consider bringing earphones and/or earplugs to class for work sessions. If you like to listen to music
                   while you work, you are welcome to do so, so long as no one else can hear it. And if you are easily
                   distracted by noise/conversation, please bring earplugs to wear so that the conversation from desk
                   critiques will not bother you.
Exams              The midterm is Tuesday, 4 March during class. The final exam is Saturday, 10 May, 9:00 AM-12:00 noon.
                   The exams include multiple choice and essay questions on the major themes of the readings and
                   lectures. Note the dates on your calendar and plan any spring break or summer travel accordingly.
Grading            Course work will be weighted as follows in calculating the final grade:
                   5 Creative Techniques Assignments, 10 pts each (50%)
                   Mid-Term Game Music OR Sound Design Analysis (20%) Due Mar 27
                   Final Portfolio Presentation (30%) Due May 6, in class


Academic           The University's Honor Code states that “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide
Integrity          by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” You are expected to maintain
                   absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in scholastic work undertaken at the
                   University. At a minimum, you should complete any assignments, exams, and other scholastic endeavors
                   with the utmost honesty, which requires you to:
                         • acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts;
                         • complete your assignments independently unless expressly authorized to seek or obtain
                              assistance in preparing them;
                         • follow instructions for assignments and exams, and observe the standards of your academic
                              discipline; and
                         • avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another student.
                   (adapted from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php)
Academic           In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines academic dishonesty
Dishonesty         as including any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved academic advantage, such as:
                         • Cheating
                         • Plagiarism
                         • Unauthorized Collaboration / Collusion
                         • Falsifying Academic Records
                         • Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain an
                              extended deadline for an assignment, or even gain an unearned financial benefit)
                         • Multiple submissions (submitting essentially the same written assignment for two courses
                              without authorization to do so)
                         • Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity
                   (adapted from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php)
                   Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
                   including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
                   (from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_faculty_syllabus.php)
Plagiarism         “Plagiarism” includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining
                   by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source, including words, ideas,
                   illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting that material as
                   one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program course requirement
                   (from Sec. 11-402, http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-
                   discipline-and-conduct/).
Copyright and      Understanding the basic principles of copyright and fair use is of critical importance to songwriters.
Fair Use           Many of the uses we will make of texts, images, and videos this semester will be covered by the doctrine
                   of fair use. However, as creators, you need to be aware of your own and other copyright holders’ legal
                   rights, and to properly identify and license your own and others’ works. We will discuss these issues
                   during the semester as needed, but when you have questions about whether or when you can
                   appropriate someone else’s work, a useful resource is Georgia K. Harper’s Copyright Crash Course,
                   available at http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/.

                      (adapted from http://www.utexas.edu/safety/preparedness/plans/EmergencyManagementPlan2013a.pdf)
 Campus Carry         The concealed carry of handguns by permit holders is generally allowed in outdoor areas, as well as
                      buildings and spaces that are accessible to the public. Permit holders are allowed to carry in classrooms.
                      It is the responsibility of concealed-carry license holders to carry their handguns on or about their person
                      at all times while on campus. “About” the person means that a license holder may carry a holstered
                      handgun in a backpack or handbag, but the backpack or handbag must be close enough that the license
                      holder can grasp it without materially changing position. The holster must completely cover the trigger
                      area and have enough tension to keep the gun in place if jostled. A license holder may not carry a
                      partially or wholly visible handgun on campus premises or on any university driveway, street, sidewalk or
                      walkway, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking area.
                      The open carry of handguns is not permitted on campus. Anyone who sees an openly carried gun on
                      campus should immediately call 911. (from https://campuscarry.utexas.edu/students)
 Overview of          Please be aware that on occasion the order and timing of the course schedule may need to be altered to
