What is expected of me?
    Complete the weekly reading assignment
    Take the weekly reading quiz
    Attend class, Flip off, and participate
    Complete the problem sets
    Work on the lab assignments
    Study for and take the two exams
 Reading Quizzes
 You will take regular weekly reading quizzes on Canvas. You may use readings
 and notes, but each quiz will be timed and can only be taken once, so make sure
 that you read beforehand and have a good internet connection and enough
 battery power before you begin. Each quiz is due by Tuesday at noon of the week
 for which the readings are assigned.
 Problem Sets
 Problem sets are out-of-class assignments designed to familiarize you with the
 methodological and statistical concepts covered in class, as well as with the
 estimation, interpretation, and presentation of quantitative data using SPSS and
 Excel (think of problem sets as homework). You will be assigned problem sets
 throughout the semester. Each problem set will be announced in class and
                                                   posted to Canvas at least one

Lab Access
You will need access to SPSS (or another statistical software package) and Excel (or
other graphing program) to complete your lab project. SPSS is available in RLP
1.402 & 1.404, which you can access when classes are not in session (see the
posted schedule for availability). SPSS may also be available in COLA labs at BAT
1.130, MEZ 4.128, and HRH 4.102B. If you wish to work on your own computer, a
six month license of SPSS can be purchased online for around $35. Excel is
available for free through UT’s Office 365 Portal.

Course & University Policies
Flipd
We will be using the Flipd app (http://www.flipdapp.co/) in class to measure
engagement and attendance, and to allot extra credit. You’re responsible for using
the Flipd app in every class to earn this credit. While you’re “Flipd Off”, you can still
receive an emergency phone call or text (which I would expect you to take in the
hall outside the classroom anyway). Flipd sends me a full summary of your
participation each class, including the amount of class time you spend Flipd off. Up
to 50% of your participation grade in class will be based on the time you spend
Flipd off and your engagement with Flipd polls outside of class. The cost to join
Flipd for the semester (about 4 months) is $7.99 ($12.99 for a one year
subscription). You can redeem a 10% discount by purchasing Flipd at this link:
https://dashboard.flipdapp.co/Students/ClassAccess and using this case-sensitive
promo code: SAVE10. Having problems with the app? Use the in-app chat to get
assistance, send an email to info@flipdapp.co, or visit their FAQ website here:
https://intercom.help/flipdapp/for-students.
Download instructions: From your phone, visit the Google Play Store or the App
Store and search Flipd. Sign into the Flipd app with your email address, Google, or
Facebook account. Once logged in you must join our class by entering this 5-digit
code (76634). You will need to login and join our class by noon on Thursday,
September 5.
Note: If you do not have a compatible mobile device, let me know as soon as
possible to discuss alternatives.
  Tech Etiquette Policy
  As research on learning shows, unexpected noises and movement automatically
  divert and capture people's attention, which means you are affecting everyone’s
  learning experience if your cell phone, tablet, laptop, etc. makes noise or is visually
  distracting during class. For this reason, I ask that you put away any technology
  that is not in use and keep your mobile devices silent and out of sight. While not
  recommended, you may use the lab computers, laptops, or tablets to access lecture
  slides and readings or to take notes. Any other use of these devices is strictly
  prohibited.

Numbering Race, Dr. Irizarry                                                   Fall 2019
Personal Pronouns
Class rosters provided by the university have your legal name. I will
gladly honor your request to address you by a different name, and by the gender
pronouns you use. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that
I may make appropriate changes to my records.
Attendance
Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class. You may miss
up to three (3) class days, regardless of the reason for the absence, with no
penalty. For each additional absence above three, I will deduct two (2) percentage
points from your final grade. There is no exception to this policy. If you do not plan
to attend regularly, you should not take this class. Students who miss class will be
responsible for the material covered and announcements made.
Late Work and Make-Up Policy
Late work will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Please communicate with me if
you are having problems keeping to the schedule. It is better to talk through
problems than ignore them. There are no make-ups for missed quizzes, but you
can miss one quiz without penalty. Make-ups for all other assignments and for
exams are only offered with proper documentation of a UT-sanctioned absence.
Email me as soon as possible to discuss.
Incompletes
In accordance with departmental and university policies, I will not grant an
incomplete except in cases with unusual circumstances.
Q Drop Policy5
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop
before the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester.
Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any
public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
Religious Holy Days
UT Austin policy requires that you notify me of your pending absence at least
fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must
miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a
religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within
a reasonable time after the absence.

Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and
assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated, or an announcement is made.
Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
  Familiarize yourself with all exit doors. Remember that the nearest exit door
   may not be the one you used to enter the building.
  If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week
   of class.
  In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class
   instructors.
  Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire
   Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services
   office.
  Academic Integrity
  The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery,
  freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each student in
  the course is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust,
  fairness, and respect toward peers and community (see
  http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php).
  For this course, collaboration is not allowed on any assignments. Any work
  you submit for academic credit must be your own work. You are encouraged to
  study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and
  the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive
  "consulting" help from classmates. However, this permissible cooperation
  should never involve one student walking another student through a problem
  from start to finish, or one student having possession of a copy of all or part of
  work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file,
  a saved data file, or a hard copy. Should copying occur, both the student who
  copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be
  copied will automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation
  of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University
  disciplinary action.

University Resources for Students
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and
abilities. If there are circumstances that make our learning environment and
activities difficult, if you have medical information that you need to share with me,
or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated,
please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment
for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as
possible. Also, please notify me as quickly as possible if the material being
presented are not accessible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these
discussions. If appropriate, also contact Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-
471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone).

Counseling and Mental Health Center
All of us benefit from support during
times of struggle. You are not alone.
There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important
part of the college experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support
sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences
any academic stress, difficult life events,
or feelings like anxiety or depression, we               Credit: CollegeDegrees360

Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the
Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another
individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a partnership among the
Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC),
the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police

Note Regarding Syllabus Changes: The following schedule is tentative and may vary depending
on class discussions and feedback. I reserve the right to make changes to the schedule of readings
and/or lectures during the course of the semester and will announce these changes both in class and
on Canvas. You should have all assigned readings completed before the beginning of class on the date
listed.
                                 The Meaning of Grades
For students, the grading process can be a mystery. After completing your essay or exam, it may
seem that they are sent off to a place where grades magically appear at random. I want to assure you
that this is not the case. Just as you put time and effort into completing your assignments and
exams, I put time and effort into grading them. This means that I do read every word of your essays,
papers, and exam answers. Whenever possible, I will have detailed grading rubrics that allow me to
deduct points in the same way from each student’s exam. In the case of response essays, in which a
specific grading rubric is not practical, the following describes my view on what makes an answer
worth each letter grade:
A        Work surpasses the requirements of an assignment by adding new insights, creativity, and/or
         particularly thoughtful analysis or applications. In “A” answers, students demonstrate a
         complete understanding of the course material, have clearly stated purposes, and support
         their ideas with examples when appropriate. Few changes, corrections, or suggestions can
         be made regarding the accuracy of information or the effectiveness of communication.
B        Work meets the requirements of the assignment. In “B” answers, students demonstrate a
         solid command of the course material, support their ideas with examples when appropriate,
         state their purposes, and apply concepts to another context if applicable. “B” work is clear
         and effective, has good organization, and has clearly expressed ideas.
C        Work partially meets the requirements of the assignment. In “C” answers, students
         demonstrate an acceptable command of the course material and a basic ability to apply
         concepts, support their ideas, and state their purposes. A “C” may indicate work that has
         some gaps and errors or communication that is inconsistent or difficult to follow.
D        Work marginally meets the requirements of the assignment and has many areas that need
         improvement. Often “D” work indicates an attempt to merely repeat the material from class
         discussions without further insight or consideration.
F        Work does not meet the requirements of the assignment. “F” work is consistently weak,
         reflecting little thought or effort.
