COURSE DESCRIPTION
    This course is designed to introduce the role and importance of advertising and integrated
communication management in modern marketing and communication. More specifically, in the
21st century, we are inevitably exposed to the advertising in every moment and at everywhere. In
this environment and as a citizen of modern capitalistic society, it is necessary to know the
advertising; the characteristics of advertising; the psychology of advertising and consumer’s
attitude toward the advertising; the role of advertising and media; and the future of advertising.
The topics listed above will be covered in this class, but you can and may deeply study these
topics in the upper level of Advertising major classes.
    After you successfully finish this class, it is expected that you may have some knowledge and
understanding about advertising and may have interests about advertising professions for your
future career.
Format and Procedures:
    This class will meet three times in the week, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 12:00 PM
to 1:00 PM at WAG 201 Each class will discuss the topic related to the advertising and your
understanding will be assessed by examination. In addition to examination, you will have in-
class pop-up quizzes and individual assignments. These assessments will enhance your learning
and understanding about advertising.
