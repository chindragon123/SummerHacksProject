DESCRIPTION. Protests and social movements are vital to public life. They are important
sources of social change. They may even be prophetic. This course explores why people rebel,
demonstrate, riot, occupy public spaces, boycott, sign petitions, organize trade unions, demand
equal rights, block abortion clinics. In this course, we will ask what are protests and social
movements? Why do people start them and join them? What are protesters motivated by? Are
they after material or cultural goals, personal or group rewards? Do protesters act rationally,
morally, and/or emotionally?
We will review the major sociological theories for explaining the dynamics of protests and social
movements. Using these theories, we will try to answer what triggers protests and movements?
What structures or shapes them? Do they follow regular patterns of development? And what is
the relationship between social movements that overlap in time and space? What affect do
protests and movements have on society? Do they provide valuable insights into society? Do
they advance social justice? Do they contribute to our social wellbeing? Or do they lead to
disorder and exact costs that outweigh benefits? Can they foreshadow the future?
We will explore these many questions by looking at a range of important social movements in
US history. We will look in greater depth at a handful of movements and blend or retool
theoretical approaches to explain them. In short, this course surveys American protests and
theories of social movements trying to explain the dynamics of social movements.
REQUIREMENTS. There will be three examinations of equal weight (30% each of final
grade) and I expect students to participate in class discussion (10% of final grade). The three
exams will cover material from lectures and the readings. Although there is some overlap
between the lectures and readings, a familiarity with both will be key to doing well on the
examinations.
I do not use the +/- grading system. Grades are A, B, C, D, or F. (90s’=A, 80’s=B, 70’s=C,
60’s=D, below 60=F)

COURSE MATERIAL
All the readings can be found through CANVAS. See links to the uploaded files for each week’s
reading under “Assignments.” Make sure you check the readings listed the week they are
assigned. These folders on CANVAS will change somewhat as we go forward and I tweak the

final until the Sunday before the week they are assigned.
