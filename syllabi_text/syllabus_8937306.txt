Please e-mail for appointments or emergencies only, and be sure to put “BIO346” in the
subject heading. We are happy to meet students during office hours, but it is really inefficient
to answer questions about the course over email. Plus we’d rather get to know you in person.
Attendance at exams is required. You must take exams in the registered period. Make-up
exams are only by prior arrangement, in the case of extreme and documented reasons. Make-
up exams may take a different form than the regularly scheduled exam, including essay exams
for example.
This is a fun but challenging course that surveys the molecular and evolutionary underpinnings
of human physiology and behavior. The course is intended as a broad summary and synthesis
of diverse areas of biology with an emphasis on its unifying concepts. Material is organized into
three broad themes: 1. Epigenetics, genetics and society. 2. Human diversity, and 3.
Becoming human. The class will use principles of biology that are derived from work with many
species and apply them to understanding human form and function. The first theme,
Epigenetics, genetics and society, discusses how our experience in the world interacts with our
genome. Human diversity explores concepts of race, geographic variation, population evolution
and recent human history. The last theme, Becoming human, moves progressively farther back
in time to understand the origins of the structure of our bodies and the cells that comprise them.
The class assumes a familiarity with Mendelian genetics and molecular genetics, including the
mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Students are expected to be proficient with the
concept of phylogeny. These expectations are based on students having successfully
completed the required pre-requisite courses BIO311C, BIO311D, and BIO325, or their
equivalents. Our major learning objectives are to:
     1. Understand the molecular basis of interactions between genomes and environments
     2. Understand how societal factors (poverty, stress, trauma) influence genome function
     3. Understand genetic contributions to health and disease
     4. Describe how human movements have shaped genetic variation
     5. Detect evidence of natural selection within the genome
     6. Understand how selection and mutation shape health and disease
     7. Identify the relationship between the human body and its homologs in other species
     8. Understand the continuity of biological processes across timescales
The class meets Tuesday and Thursday from 9:30am-11am. There are weekly discussion with
times varying according to section. To evaluate your understanding, there will be three in-class
exams, three quizzes, and some miscellaneous assignments. Exams emphasize integration and
application of concepts, and are designed to mimic the range of questions students can expect
to find on pre-professional exams, like the Medical College Admissions Test. Grades will be
weighted as follows.


         Exam 1,        Tuesday, October 2                          100pts
         Exam 2,        Thursday, November 1                        100pts
         Exam 3,        Thursday, December 6                        100pts
         Discussion section                                         100pts
                Discussion participation and attendance 20pts
                Quizzes, 3 @ 10pts 30pts
                Additional assignments TBD 50pts
         Total                                                      400pts
Scores on tests will be curved. We will calculate the curve by averaging the top three scores in
the class, subtracting the average from 100, and adding the difference to everyone’s exam
scores. The total percentage of correct items will be converted into letter grades using the
familiar standards: A = 90.0-100, B = 80.0-89.9, C = 70.0-79.9, and D = 60.0-69.9.
The course reading will be a mixture of scientific and popular press articles distributed as pdf
files. These pdfs are available in the course Canvas site. Underlined readings are original
scientific papers (so allow more time to get through them). Items in blue refer to the discussion
section.
