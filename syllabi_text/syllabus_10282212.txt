COURSE DESCRIPTION
Are we what we eat? 19th century French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin famously stated
as much in his Physiology of Taste (1825), but what does this mean within our increasingly globalized
food system? The phrase “you are what you eat” suggests that the act of eating is one of
entrenchment: food choices represent and intensify one’s own cultural and personal identity. But
considering that issues of food access, public health, and unfair or illegal food labor practices within
the food system cut across race and class boundaries, this may now be an inaccurate – or at the very
least – uncomfortable maxim. This course interrogates themes of identity, ethnicity, race, and power
in order to better understand the complexity of human relationships with food. We will focus on
how individual and group identity is constructed, affirmed, or refused through food choices by
surveying foundational works within the field of food studies and connecting them to the pressing
social issues of today, particularly as they manifest in the everyday activity of eating.
REQUIRED MATERIALS
All readings and visual materials can be found online via CLIO, Canvas, or the link provided.
ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING
Attendance and Participation: 25%
This seminar is based on your active and daily participation, which is central to the quality of the
course. You will show this daily engagement verbally, by contributing to discussion, and in writing,
through occasional short in-class reflections.
In anticipation of each Tuesday class, you will post a one-paragraph response to the readings by
6pm on Monday night.
You are allowed one unexcused absence. More than one unexcused absence will lead to a lowered
final grade. If you have personal circumstances that may prevent you from regular attendance (such
as chronic illness or responsibilities as a primary caregiver), please make an appointment to come see
the Professor to discuss alternatives.
                                                     1


Ethnographic Field Notes Assignment: 30%
          Field Notes and Ethnographic Description (25%) – Due 2/18
          By Week 5, you will have compiled a series of “field notes” entries based on your
          observation of a social space (anywhere but a coffee shop) in which food is present. Use the
          observations recorded in your field notes to construct an ethnographic description. You will
          turn in your set of field notes alongside your ethnographic description, which should be a
          minimum length of 1,500 words.
          In-class Presentation (5%)
          In Week 5 or 6, you will give a brief (5 minute) presentation on your observations in class.
Class Zine and Final Paper: 45%
The final project for this course will have creative and academic components. Together, the class
will compile a zine focused on a theme (TBD) around food and identity. Each student will
contribute a page or a spread. In Week 12, we will have an in-class zine workshop with a graphic
designer.
          Zine Drafts (5%) – Due 4/7
          In Week 12, you will produce 2-3 drafts of your zine page(s) and bring them with you class
          to discuss during our workshop.
          Zine Page(s) (15%) – Due 5/5
          In Week 16, you will submit your zine page(s) so that they can be compiled.
          Final Paper (25%) – Due 5/15
          You will turn in a formal academic essay as a companion piece to your zine page(s), which
          will provide a description and rationale for your contribution. This should include citations
          of books and articles that informed your thinking, which can be drawn from the syllabus, as
          well as beyond the readings for this course, and be a minimum length of 3,000 words.
Specific guidelines for each assignment will be discussed in class and posted on Canvas in
advance of the due dates.
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
Computers and electronic devices are not allowed during class time, with the exception of structured
activities and at the Professor’s discretion.
Policy Regarding Late Assignments: All assignments are due on the dates agreed upon, either as
stated in the syllabus or as discussed at least 24 hours in advance with the professor.
Papers submitted late without a pre-arranged extension will be downgraded in an effort to provide a
fair grading system for all students. Within the first week of the paper’s deadline, you will lose 1%
per business day off of your final grade. After that, it will be 5% per week or any portion thereof (so,
if it’s 2 days late, you lose 2%; if it’s 7 days late, you lose 5%, but if it’s 8 days late, you lose 10%).
Please read the syllabus carefully, consult with your schedule, and plan ahead.

own and without quotations. It also includes using someone else’s ideas – from any source – and not
giving credit to that source in your citations. If you are not sure what to do, ask your professor or a
University librarian before turning in your final assignment.
