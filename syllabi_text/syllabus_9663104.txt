COURSE DESCRIPTION: The Once & Future Middle Ages –
Every generation produces its own version of the Middle Ages. Using literature, film, and popular culture,
this course examines how the conventions of medieval courtly love and chivalric romance have been
utilized—often parodied—from the 14th century to the 21st. We will move from classics like Sir Gawain & the
Green Knight and Malory's Le Morte D’Arthur, through 19th-century romanticism and pragmatism, to the
early British fantasists (Tolkien, The Hobbit), feminist neo-paganists (The Mists of Avalon), and beyond (Neil
Gaiman; Camelot 3000; Monty Python & the Holy Grail?). Show-stoppers to include Mark Twain's A
Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court; some unspeakably bawdy medieval fabliaux; and our very own
Arthurian film-fest. Camelot has become difficult to find, but expect excursions to sites such as Cornwall’s
Tintagel Castle (where King Arthur was conceived); Glastonbury Abbey (where he’s buried); and Avalon Tor
(inside of which he’s still living). Class will probably not be held at The Eagle & Child, the Oxford pub where
Tolkien, Lewis & the Inklings met on Mondays between the wars...

Medieval Encounters: Reading & Critical Reflection Journal GUIDELINES
Two entries per week: one on literary encounters (course reading), in the context of questions posed
or begun or returned to in class; one on extracurricular encounters (not course reading), which could
include field trip experiences; Oxford daily life or personal travel outings; or (but please don’t return
to this well too often!) via contemporary media/popular culture, either that which you stumble upon
or that which you go looking for. We’ll discuss parameters and appropriate examples in class, but do
look for a MIX of experiences, in terms of media/genre/ material; period (i.e. medieval past; Tudor-
Romantic-Victorian past; 20th-century/recent past, contemporary moment). Please avoid
generalizations and instead emphasize specific details.
Arthurian Film Fest: GUIDELINES
Select an Arthurian film from the partial list provided (or find one on your own); watch it; choose a
scene you’d like to share with the rest of us (time limit t.b.a.); and write a one-page analysis of the
clip (and larger film)’s particular representation of Arthurian medievalism, utilizing techniques and
terminology from the Writing About Film canvas piece. After you’ve seen everyone else’s clip, and
we’ve discussed in class, write a one-page response putting your entry into conversation with others
film versions of the legend. Be sure to pay attention to film as a medium, and to raise and then
answer high-stakes questions (how do these representative choices matter interpretively? what do
they communicate to us about the cultural expectations and ideological blind-spots of period
audiences? how do they engage the larger Arthurian tradition? what version of the legend is this?
what aspects are suppressed/emphasized? so what?).
