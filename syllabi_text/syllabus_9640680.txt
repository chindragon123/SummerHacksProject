             M f325K: Discrete Mathematics (86335), Summer 2019
                                   Monday–Friday, 1:00–2:15 in RLM 5.104
Instructor: Jesse Miller

Description, Prerequisites, and Objectives: This course provides an introduction to mathematical proofs in the
context of a variety of different discrete (in particular, not Calculus-based) topics in mathematics, including elementary
number theory, set theory, and counting. A grade of at least C- in M408D, M408L, or M408S is required to take this
course.
Writing Flag: This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience
with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete
substantial writing projects, and receive feedback to help you improve your writing.
Required Material: The required textbook is Discrete Mathematics with Applications, 5th edition, by Susanna Epp.
Lecture: Lectures will be spent primarily solving problems and discussing solutions. You are expected to have read
the section(s) for each lecture before coming to class.
Homework: Written homework assignments will be assigned during the semester.
Written Proofs: Four written proofs will be given during the semester. The focus will be on the written presenta-
tion. Whereas the focus of the classwork and homework is on solving problems, the focus of these written proofs is
communicating the proof to your readers. There will be opportunities to revise some of these assignments.
Exams: There will be an in-class midterm and final exam. The location of the final exam will be announced later
in the semester. You are responsible for being on campus during the final exam period. The University’s final exam
policies can be found at http://registrar.utexas.edu/students/exams/policies/.
Grading: This course is graded using the following weights:
   35%     Homework            Lowest dropped.
   35%     Written Proofs      Lowest dropped.
   30%     Exams               Equally weighted. The final exam grade replaces the midterm grade, if the former
                               is higher.
Unless otherwise indicated, partial credit on written work is possible only when answers are justified. For a suspected
mistake in an assignment’s scoring to be checked, you must, within one week of the assignment’s returning, resubmit
it to me with a written explanation of what you think is wrong. The scale for the course will be no stricter than the
standard one: a cutoff of 93 for an A, 90 for an A-, 87 for a B+, etc. The final scale will not be determined before the
end of the semester. There are no curves.
Make-Up Work: Some assignments are dropped to accommodate illnesses, emergencies, and other legitimate reasons
that prevent assignment completion. Therefore, no late assignments are accepted nor make-up exams given.
Documented Disabilities: If you have a documented disability, you should contact Services for Students with Disabil-
ities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or (866) 329-3986 (video phone), or visit http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/.
You must contact me by the 4th class day to ensure that accommodations can be made.
University Honor Code: Cheating is punished to the fullest extent allowed by university policy. Cheating includes,
but is not limited to, using any electronic device on an exam, and presenting another person’s work as your own.
General Expectations: Before class begins, you should turn off cell phones, laptops, and any other electronic devices.
I expect you to be present for the entire class. If you arrive late, or leave early, please sit near an exit to minimize the
disturbance. If you miss class for any reason, contact another student (not me) to see what you missed.
Email: You are always welcome to email me, as long as you include your EID and unique number and you consult
this syllabus before asking any questions about course policies. I expect you to check the email address listed in the
UT system regularly, and to check Canvas regularly for announcements.
