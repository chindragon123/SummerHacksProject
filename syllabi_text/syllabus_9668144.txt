Course Description. Economics 421K is an intermediate level course in microeconomic theory for
business students. Microeconomics focuses on the behavior of individual agents such as
consumers and ﬁrms, as well as speciﬁc markets, their structure, and various outcomes in those
markets. This course is meant to develop a microeconomics toolbox, focusing on methods of
microeconomic analysis and how to apply those methods. The subject ma er that we cover in this
class is tailored for accoun ng and other business students and it is taught at the same level of
rigor as its sister class for economics students. We will also apply some of these concepts to
economic and ﬁnancial consul ng scenarios.
Canvas Page. Our class web page will be on UT Canvas. Announcements and class material
(prac ce problems, sample exams, etc.) will be posted on Canvas, and important dates from the
schedule will be posted to the calendar.

infrequently.

  The textbook and online homework package is the only purchase you will need to make. Any supplemental
materials will be made available to you.


Class Meetings. We will meet Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00a to 10:00a in
ECJ 1.202 for lecture and discussion. Lectures will be devoted mainly to covering new material.
Each Friday, a recita on and review session will be held by my teaching assistants. (Please consult
your class schedule for the me and loca on of your Friday review session.) These sessions will be
devoted to reviewing topics I have covered, working homework problems that I have assigned, or
going over prac ce exams.

Grading. Your course grade will be determined by your performance on:
     (a) Smartwork5 homework problems                 (60 points / 20%)
     (b) Midterm exams                                (75 points / 25% each)
     (c) Final exam                                   (90 points / 30%)
Grading will be on a curve, by which I simply mean that your grade will depend on your cumula ve
course points rela ve to the cumula ve course point distribu on for the en re class. I will provide
an es mate of the current curve a er each midterm exam.
Exam Policy. Exam dates are listed in the Summer 2019 Schedule at the end of this document. All
exams will be closed book, closed note. Calculators are permi ed, but they must be simple and
non-programmable. If your calculator has memory, it must be cleared prior to the exam.
Please verify now that you will be able to attend all of the exam dates, including the final exam.
If you miss an exam due to an emergency, you need to document your emergency with Student
Emergency Services (h p://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/) as soon as you are able to.
They will, in turn, no fy me (along with the rest of your professors). A missed midterm exam will
only be excused without penalty if the absence is due to a verifiable emergency3 or some other
reason that the university explicitly accepts as legi mate. In this case, the weight of the
comprehensive ﬁnal exam will be scaled up to 55%. This policy only applies to one missed
midterm exam. If you miss both midterm exams, you must drop the class. If you have an oﬃcial
university related conﬂict that you know of in advance, you may schedule a makeup exam in
advance, and only with proper documenta on of your conﬂict. Unexcused missed exams will not

  A veriﬁable emergency is a situa on where you unexpectedly have to miss an exam, and you can provide
documenta on of the emergency situa on which precluded you a ending that exam. A note that you visited
University Health Services is not considered to be veriﬁed documenta on of an emergency.


be rescheduled and will receive a score of zero. A missed ﬁnal exam will also receive a score of
zero. Finally, note that I never give early exams for any reason.
Succeeding in the Course. Overall, I think there is a simple recipe for success in the course:
                (1) come to every lecture and take notes carefully
                (2) ask ques ons during lecture if something is unclear
                (3) review the notes and keep current with your homework problems
                (4) review the textbook to shore up concepts
                (5) use the Friday sessions to review concepts and homework problems
Accommodations for Students with Disabilities. Students with disabili es may request
appropriate academic accommoda ons from the Division of Diversity and Community
Engagement, Services for Students with Disabili es (h p://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/). All
SSD students are to make exam accommodation requests directly with the SSD testing center, at
least two weeks in advance of each exam. You will take your exams at the SSD testing center.
Please schedule your midterm and ﬁnal exams at the same me as the class exams. If you fail to
schedule your exams with SSD, you must take them at the normal me with the rest of the class.
Academic Dishonesty. I take instances of academic dishonesty very seriously. If I or one of my TAs
suspects a student has commi ed an act of scholas c dishonesty (chea ng on an exam, etc.), the
student will receive a zero on that exam, and the case will be reported to the Dean of Students.
Chea ng includes looking at another student’s exam/Scantron/calculator. For more informa on:
                  h p://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php
A Note on Final Grades. I think very carefully before I assign the point cutoﬀs for grades in this
class. Once the cutoﬀs for the grade distribu on are determined, they are absolutely ﬁnal and I
never give special preference to any individual student who wants to be bumped up to a higher
grade.
