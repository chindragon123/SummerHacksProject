I. Course Description
During much of the 5th century BCE Athens was the cultural and intellectual center of the Greek world.
The citizens of 5th-century Athens enjoyed an unprecedented level of power in governing a state whose
wealth was derived largely from slave labor and the exploitation of its role as ruler of a maritime empire.
This course will explore Athenian society, democracy, and empire from the development of Athenian
hegemony in the early 470s BCE through the break-up of the Athenian Empire in 404 BCE.
This upper division course carries a writing flag and will be conducted as a seminar with student
participation central to its success. The structure of the class is topics-oriented (a selection of key topics
and problems rather than a historical survey). We will explore the full range of evidence available to the
ancient historian: literary, documentary (inscriptions and papyri), and the material record as
documented through archaeological excavation (from temples to coins and everything in between). Our
focus will be these ancient sources and the methods modern historians use in their interpretation.
