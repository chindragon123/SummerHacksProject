Course Description:
This survey course is an introduction to the study of Africa's past through the story of
urbanization. It begins with an overview of African cities around 1500—a time of increasing
human migration and global trade. It considers the diversity of early African politics, religion, and
family life through regional case studies. Special attention is afforded the social upheaval that
came in the wake of the intercontinental slave trade and related growth of African city-states.
The second half of the course addresses African cities in the modern period, focusing on the
advent of European colonialism in the 1800s and its aftermath. Major themes include: everyday
life under imperial rule, healing and religion, African nationalism, and development theories. The
course concludes with historical dilemmas in contemporary Africa including immigration, the
AIDS crisis, and transitions to democratic rule. Students will select an African city to study
through independent research projects. Open to non-majors. This course satisfies History
department pre-1800 requirement for history majors.
Course Goals:
     •   By the end of this course you will be able to describe the history of at least five African
         cities (Timbuktu, Kumasi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, and Zanzibar/Dar es Salaam).
     •   You will have a geographic understanding of different regions and African polities.
     •   You may have learned a bit of a language spoken in Africa.
     •   You will be able to find historical maps, photographs, newspaper articles, and
         archeological data.
Assignments:
Open to all interested participants. Excused absences require prior notice or a doctor’s
statement.

City Project:
Throughout the semester, we will focus on the history of Timbuktu, Kumasi, Kinshasa, Cape
Town, and Zanzibar/Dar es Salaam. You will select one of these five cities, or another of your
choosing to do weekly immersive activities. As a culmination of your research, you will make a
presentation for the final weeks of the course to share with the class. You will consult with the
instructor to determine the nature of your final presentation. Options include a dramatic play with
other course participants, a powerpoint presentation, a stop-motion animation, a poem, graphic
novel, or traditional paper in lieu of a presentation.

In-class Discussions:
Please arrive on time and be prepared to discuss the readings for the week (available on
Canvas). The purpose of our discussions is to think through life in another time and place, and
learn more about the historical context in which a city emerged. It is an opportunity for you to sit
back and imagine life in a faraway place which can be very relaxing and fun. African history also
opens up many dilemmas, and complex themes as slavery, exploration, colonialism, migration,
and global poverty which we will use class time to process and discuss.
You will have the opportunity to lead discussions two weeks during the semester. For those
weeks, upload a two-paragraph response on one of the readings (part of participation grade).
If you find it challenging to speak up in class or require any accommodations, please
meet with me to discuss strategies.
Safety:
Please note that I do not allow concealed guns in my office, GAR 3.106 and may remind you
orally when you visit. You may make arrangements to speak with me by phone during my office
hours. While I am not permitted to ban concealed weapons in our classroom, please note that
you must be 21 and older and hold a license for a firearm. Licensed carriers must have the gun
in a holster on or about them. Openly carried weapons are not allowed on the UT campus. If a
                                                   2


gun is visible in class, faculty and students are advised to immediately call 911 and leave the
