IV.    Course Requirements
       Class attendance and participation policy:
       Regular and punctual attendance at all classes is required. Attendance is taken at the beginning of
       every class. Absences of each student are recorded without exception from the official date of her/his
       enrollment. Both tardiness and early departure from class are forms of absenteeism. 15 minutes late
       to the start of class will constitute a tardy. At the end of each class, tardy students must make the
       instructor aware of their attendance or they will be marked as absent. Leaving class before being
       dismissed by your professor will constitute an early departure. Two instances of tardiness or early
       departure equal one absence. A class in which a student is tardy and departs early on the same day is
       considered an absence. If a serious medical or personal situation occurs affecting attendance, please
       discuss it with your professor. More than three unexcused absences will cause your final grade to
       automatically drop one letter.
       Course Readings/Materials:
         I will post reading materials as necessary.
       Optional Textbook:
       • Mixing Audio: Concepts, Practices and Tools – Roey Izhaki
       Supplies needed:
       Over-the-ear headphones and external hard drive. REQUIRED every class meeting!
       Use of Canvas in class:
       In this class I use Canvas—a Web-based course management system with password-protected access
       at http://courses.utexas.edu —to distribute course materials, to communicate and collaborate
       online, to post grades, to submit assignments.
       Student presentations:
       Students will give a ten- to fifteen-minute presentation about a specialized audio processing tool of
       their choice beginning Week 3. Students will sign up at the beginning of the semester for weekly time
       slots to present in class. Additionally, students will be asked to give short progress-update
       presentations for their midterm and final projects to receive feedback from their peers.
V.     Grading Procedures
       Grades will be based on:
       1. Assignments/Quizzes                                          50%
       2. Final Project                                                20%
       3. Midterm Project                                              10%
       3. Audio Processing Tool Presentation                           10%
       4. Class Participation /Attendance                              10%
                                                          3


AET 321C Course Syllabus
         Late/Missed Assignments:
         If you miss an examination or an assignment deadline due to a serious, documented medical or
         personal situation, I will give you an opportunity to complete the work within a reasonable time.
         Otherwise, late assignments will receive a maximum grade value of 50%. December 9th is the last
         call for any late assignments from the semester (graded at 50% maximum value).
         Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric. Please note: to ensure
         fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will be
         inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not recognize the grade of A+.
         A = 94-100
         A- = 90-93
         B+ = 87-89
         B = 84-86
         B- = 80-83
         C+ = 77-79
         C = 74-76
         C- = 70-73
         D+ = 67-69
         D = 64-66
         D- = 60-63
         F = 0-60
VI.      Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The
University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic
integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your
own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of
plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code, which can be found at the
following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
VII.     Other University Notices and Policies
 Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence to Students
All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student notification policy. It is the
student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or her e-mail address. Students
are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related
communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-
mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this policy and instructions for
updating your e-mail address are available at http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564 .
Q drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six
Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution.
For more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn
differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me
know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of
the course. There are also a range of resources on campus:

Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information
that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be
evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment for all
students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain
the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact:

Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope
with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking
for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Religious Holidays
Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code states that a student shall be excused from attending classes or
other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including travel
for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized for that
absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the student is
excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy requires students to notify each of their
instructors at least fourteen days prior to the date they will be absent from scheduled classes to observe a
religious holy day.
