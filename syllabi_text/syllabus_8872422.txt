HIS 366N/AFR 372D
GLOBAL HISTORY OF DISEASE
Fall 2018
Prof. Osseo-Asare
Course Overview:
This course introduces major themes in the history of medicine through the lens of disease. It
focuses on two questions: How have people defined well-being? How have they responded to
illness? The course considers major diseases to understand their multiple meanings across time
and space including: plague, cholera, influenza, sleeping sickness, PTSD, AIDS and malaria.
Themes to be considered include changing theories of disease causality, the development of
international public health policy, social understandings of the body, and the growth of the
pharmaceutical industry. The course emphasizes the roles governments, medical practitioners,
and patients play in the social construction of disease and health. Case studies from Brazil,
India, South Africa and the United States will be analyzed through readings, lectures and films.
Course Goals:
Primarily, this course aims to equip participants with tools for reading and researching about the
past. Course participants will learn how to use news reports as sources of historical evidence.
Second, it provides a useful introduction to medical history across cultures for those considering
a career in medicine or public health. It shows how people define illness according to particular
social and cultural categories overtime. Through specific case studies, the course provides
participants with an historical framework to interpret current debates in health policy and
disease management.


Flags:
Global History of Disease has been designated as a UT Global Cultures Flag course.
The purpose of a Global Cultures Flag course is “to increase your familiarity with
cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and
histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.”
