ASSIGNMENTS
Weekly Questions
Each week 3-5 questions pertaining to the reading assignments for that week will be posted to Canvas.
Answers to the posted questions will be due at the beginning of each class. Each question set will be
posted one week in advance of the due date.
Preliminary Project
This exercise involves identifying building materials and conditions of the Littlefield Home, a 19th century
residence located on the University of Texas campus. Elevation drawings will be provided. Requirements
for this project include:
      •   Identification of materials and conditions on the elevation drawings
      •   Written description of the building, including character defining features, materials and
          conditions. This project will be due on March 4th.
Independent Research Project
For this semester-long project, you will study the materials and conditions of an historic building in Austin.
The independent research project requires researching the history of the building and investigating
factors related to existing conditions. Requirements for this project include:
     •   Identification of materials and conditions on elevation drawings. Format: Adobe InDesign or
         Illustrator, or CAD.
     •   Illustrated glossary of materials and conditions. Format: digital images, approximately 1 MB in
         size, saved as jpg files.
     •   Written description of the building’s history, character defining features, materials and
         conditions, factors related to deterioration, treatment and work recommendations. Format: 6-8
         pages of single-spaced text (10-12 size fonts) with references cited.
     •   Presentation of your work in class. Format: PowerPoint
Elevation drawing pin-ups and presentations are scheduled for April 22nd and completed projects are due
on May 10th.
EXAMINATION
There will be a midterm examination on March 25th. There will be no final exam for this course.
ATTENDANCE
Punctual and regular attendance is mandatory. Participation is expected. With three (3) unexcused
absences, the student’s final grade for the course will be lowered by a full letter grade. The final grade will
be lowered by a full letter grade for each unexcused absence thereafter. Aside from religious observances,
absences are only excused with written documentation of a medical issue or family emergency. The
student is responsible for completing work missed due to excused absences and initiating communication


                                                                                                  SPRING 2019
with the instructor to determine due dates. If a student is late (5 minutes after the start of class) three (3)
times, it will be counted as one (1) unexcused absence. Students should notify the instructor prior to class
if lateness or absence is known in advance. Students must notify instructors directly regarding lateness or
absences; Asking a classmate to inform the instructor is not acceptable.
RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
A student shall be excused from attending classes of other required activities, including examinations, for
the observance of a religious holy day, including travel for the purpose. A student whose absence is
excused under this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an
examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after
the absence. University policy requires students to notify each of their instructors as far in advance of the
absence as possible so that arrangements can be made. By UT Austin policy, you must notify the instructor
of the pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of a religious holy day. If you must miss a
class, an examination, an assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be
given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Students who violate University policy on academic integrity are subject to disciplinary penalties, including
the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms
the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on academic integrity will be strictly
enforced. Refer to the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website for official University policies and
procedures on academic integrity: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php.

EMERGENCY EVACUATION
In the case of emergency evacuation:
     •   Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
         buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
         assembling outside.
     •   Students should familiarize themselves with all exit doors of each classroom and building they
         may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one used when entering the
         building.


                                                                                                SPRING 2019
    •    Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
         week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
    •    Reentry into a building is prohibited unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
         Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services
         offices.
