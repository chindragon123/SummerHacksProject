    Office hours: As announced, following the return of graded cases.
    Gilman will assist with the grading of cases and exams. After graded cases are returned, office
    hours will be scheduled. If you have grading or other questions concerning a case that has
    been returned, please make every effort to attend his scheduled office hours. Please bring all
    other questions (concerning course material, case preparation and exam-related matters) to
    my attention.
Canvas
    We will use the web-based Canvas course site extensively. To access, follow the links from
    your MyUT Student Portal or the University website.
    I will use Canvas to post announcements, course materials and scores. Please check it
    frequently and before every class.
Enhancing the Enjoyment of this Course
    I prefer an informal classroom, as I have found such an environment to be more enjoyable and
    conducive to student attendance and participation. In my classes, silence is not golden – please
    join the class discussion if you have a question, comment or response!
    Please also assist me in maintaining a positive, productive learning environment by showing
    courtesy and respect for your fellow students (and me). To that end, please make all
    reasonable efforts to be on time to class and exams – arriving late is distracting and
    disruptive to your colleagues and me.
    In my experience as an instructor and a student, use of electronic devices by students in class is
    distracting and disruptive. Accordingly, the use of electronic devices in class is not permitted.

    Please turn off and put away your cell phone, tablet, laptop, and other electronic devices
    before class begins.
Required Course Materials
    Course files. I will provide any supplemental, non-textbook course materials, including
        PowerPoint slides, homework suggestions and solutions, cases, and in-class exercises. These
        files will be available on Canvas, with the exception of certain in-class exercises that may only
        be distributed in class. These materials do not substitute for class itself, so it is important to
        attend each class session. Issues and problems similar to those discussed in class are
        frequently tested on the midterm and final examinations.

Grading
          Course grades will be based on a 400-point scale, as follows:
                                                                   Points Possible
 Midterm examinations (2)                                          150 (37.5%)
 Final examination                                                 110 (27.5%)
 Cases (3)                                                         120 (30%)
 Participation                                                      20 (5%)
 Total possible points                                             400
      I do not, prior to the semester, establish fixed point or percentage cut-offs regarding letter
      grades. I will make these determinations at the end of the course based on both absolute
      and relative performance considerations. Historically, my grade distribution in this course
      has been approximately 30-35% A, 15-25% A-/B+, 40-50% B, and the remainder B- and
      below. However, each class is different and the final grade distribution this term may vary
      from the foregoing historical distribution.
      As students are naturally curious about their standing during the semester, I will provide the
      class with an interim assessment of performance following the second midterm exam.
      However, any mid-semester indication of course performance is merely to assist you in
      evaluating your performance to date and achieving your goals in this course. It is not a
      guarantee or suggestion of percentages required to obtain final grades or that you will
      receive any particular grade in this course.
Each graded component is described below:
Examinations (two midterms with 150 total points available and a final exam with 110 points
available)
          Examinations will emphasize concepts and issues discussed in class and covered in
recommended homework exercises and problems. I will provide additional exam-related information
prior to each exam. Exams will primarily contain problems similar to those done in class and suggested
as homework, but may also contain short answer questions on covered topics. The final examination
will emphasize material covered after the second midterm, but will also be partially “cumulative” in that
it will test certain topics relating to consolidation.

Cases (three with 120 total points available)
          To refine your writing skills and your ability to analyze and resolve more realistic and less
structured problems in Advanced Accounting, there will be three graded case exercises based on real-
world examples that have been adapted for teaching purposes. Cases will be posted on Canvas one
week or more before their respective due dates and each case will be allocated a maximum of 40 points.
          Cases will be graded for breadth, depth and quality of analysis, quality of writing and
professional impression. It is important to be both complete and concise in your case analyses and to
pay close attention to case announcements and instructions. Do not repeat or summarize the case
facts, except where needed to support a position. Your case analyses will be limited to four pages and
must be in memorandum format (addressed to me), double-spaced, use a font no smaller than 10,
and have left and right margins of at least 1”.
          In the formative stage of a case assignment, you are welcome to discuss the case with other
members in this class, including on Canvas. However, you may not discuss cases with persons who
are not in this class. Moreover, copying from another student's solution is scholastic dishonesty,
and will be penalized severely. (See "Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty" later in this syllabus for
clarification.) Students should not use this policy to jointly prepare cases or collaborate on case
solutions, but rather to clarify case issues before preparing solutions independently.
          We will discuss cases in class. Discussion of cases is an important part of the course, so
please be prepared to discuss and defend your positions in class (see “Participation,” below).
          Certain cases may require research using the Codification. To access, use the following

Participation (20 points)
          Your active participation will make this course substantially more enjoyable (for you and me) and
significantly enhance the clarity of points discussed in class. Moreover, the ability to provide meaningful
input in a professional setting is a critical element of career success. Thus, to give you an incentive to attend
and participate, 20 points will be based on my genuine assessment of your cumulative in-class participation
in this class (including attendance, if and when taken).
          To earn significant participation credit, consistent, constructive classroom participation is
necessary. In reviewing student performance from past semesters, I observed a positive correlation
between students’ final grades and their level of attendance and participation in the course.
          In evaluating course performance, I reserve the right to take into account any violations of course
policies, such as consistent tardiness or arriving late for an exam, the use of electronic devices in class, or
any other activities that are distracting or disruptive to the class.
          If you have a concern about this (or any other) aspect of your grade, please see me. I will be happy
to provide suggestions on how you might improve your performance in the course.

Homework
         Each chapter in the text is followed by exercises and problems. Some of these reinforce
concepts discussed in class, while others address matters (discussed in the text but) not
discussed in class. Recommended homework exercises and problems will be posted on Canvas.
Solutions will be posted as we cover related material in class.
         Homework is voluntary and will not be collected. Hence, homework does not technically count
as part of your course grade. However, in my experience with this and similar courses, it is very
important to complete the homework as we cover the related material in class. I strongly suggest
that you timely complete the suggested homework – initially, without relying on the solutions - and
not fall behind.
         I will consider the assigned homework when I prepare each examination, i.e., some exam
questions may be similar to homework exercises and problems. I expect that students who put diligent
effort into the homework will do better on examinations. In past discussions with students who
performed poorly on midterm examinations, such students commonly reported falling behind or
relying too heavily on solutions when completing homework (or both), as significant factors.
Discussion Forum
         Along with other features of Canvas, I encourage you to take advantage of the discussion
forums for this course. Postings can relate to class discussions, homework problems, case issues, exam-
related matters, careers, current events or any other topics/issues that are relevant to this course. I
monitor the discussion forum periodically (and more frequently prior to exams and case due dates).
Ground rules for discussion forum:
 1. For questions or comments of general interest to the class (i.e., not personal matters), please use
      the discussion forums, not e-mail! I may ask you to post your e-mail query on a discussion forum
      so that your classmates will receive the benefit of your questions or insights and any responses
      thereto.
2. Be professional and courteous. Discussion forums of this type are used throughout the business
      world. You do not need to be overly formal, but forums such as this offer a good opportunity to
      practice professional business communication. Please keep in mind that I will read your posts.
3. From time to time I will establish special forums within the discussion board for exams and cases.
      To maximize the usefulness of your posting, please use the most appropriate forum. For
      example, questions about homework problems in the days leading up to the first midterm exam
      should be posted in the “Midterm Exam 1 Forum.”
Canvas downtimes and course requirements:
         As with all computer systems, there are occasional scheduled downtimes and
unanticipated interruptions of the Canvas system. Notification of these disruptions will
be posted on the Canvas login page. Scheduled downtimes are not an excuse for turning
in a case late or failing to timely complete other course requirements. As downtimes are
often unpredictable, I advise you to print out cases and any related instructions as soon
as they are available.

Policy on Missed Examinations and Assignments
         In general, medical emergencies, family emergencies and university-sponsored conflicts are
the only valid reasons for missing an examination or failing to turn in a case when due. I may
require some form of supporting documentation, such as a signed note from a physician or other
verification of the emergent situation or conflict and, if appropriate, I ask that you register your
situation with the Office of Student Emergency Services. At that point I will decide the best make-up
alternative on a case-by-case basis, which could mean a make-up exam, an extension, or recalculating
the semester grade to omit the missed component, depending on the circumstances. In the case of a
conflict due to a university-sponsored event, you must notify me as soon as you are aware of the
conflict and before the examination date or assignment due date.
         An interview or office visit is not a valid reason to miss an examination or to fail to turn in a
case when due. If you anticipate a conflict with an exam or case due date (see “Course Schedule”
below), I urge you to make alternate arrangements for that activity or event in the case of an exam, or
to turn your case in (to me, with a copy to our TA) via email prior to class.
Religious Holidays
          Religious holy days sometime conflict with class and examination schedules. By University
policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss an examination or an assignment in order to
observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time after the absence.
Policy on Students with Disabilities
         Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the
Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-
6259, http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/. If you are a qualified student with a disability, please
provide your accommodations letter (as soon as practicable) and see me to discuss any appropriate
accommodations that have been recommended for this course.
Assistance with Case Writing
          I encourage you to use the University Writing Center (UWC), located in the
Learning Commons of the Perry Castaneda Library (PCL), to assist you in writing your
case analyses. The UWC offers constructive, expert help with writing, by appointment or
on a drop-in basis (although I suggest you make an appointment and not wait until the
“last minute”). The UWC works with students on both academic and non-academic
writing and their services are not just for writing with “problems.” Getting feedback from
an informed audience is a normal part of a successful writing project. Consultants help
students develop strategies to improve their writing. Further, the assistance they provide
is intended to foster independence - each student determines how to use the consultant’s
advice and the consultants are trained to help you in ways that preserve the integrity of
your work.

University Electronic Mail Notification Policy
         All students should become familiar with the University’s official e-mail student
notification policy. It is the student’s responsibility to keep the University informed as to
changes in his or her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent
and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related communications,
recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-
mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this
policy and instructions for updating your email address are available at:
http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html.
Electronic Class Roster and Student Privacy
         The University has requested that students be notified of their privacy rights in regard to
electronic class rosters:
Password-protected class sites will be available for all accredited courses taught at the
University. Syllabi, handouts, assignments and other resources are types of information
that may be available within these sites. Site activities could include exchanging e-mail,
engaging in class discussions and chats, and exchanging files. In addition, class e-mail
rosters will be a component of the sites. Students who do not want their names included
in these electronic class rosters must restrict their directory information in the Office of
the Registrar, Main Building, Room 1. For information on restricting directory
information see: http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar.
Diversity and Inclusion
         It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be
well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed and that the
diversity that students bring to this class can be comfortably expressed and be viewed
as a resource, strength and benefit to all students. Please come to me at any time with
any concerns.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty and Working Together on Cases
Policy of the Department of Accounting
         The Department of Accounting has a Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty in the MPA
Program. It is available via the Department website at http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/MPA/Student-
Code-of-Ethics.aspx.
The Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in
detail in the Department's Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty in the MPA Program. By
teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all faculty responsibilities described in
that document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all student
responsibilities described in that document. If the application of the Statement on
Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your

responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility
of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty
harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the University, and the value of
our academic brand, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You
should refer to the Student Judicial Services website at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ to access the official University policies and
procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what
constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
         Integrity is a public good from which we all benefit and a trait of successful businessmen and
women. I intend to conduct this course in an environment of trust and cooperation. I can only achieve
this, however, if you maintain an atmosphere of absolute ethical integrity in this course.
Personal Policy on Working Together on Cases (applies only to this course)
         For this class, you may discuss issues related to assigned cases with other students in this class
(but not others). You may work in the formative stages of an assignment to clarify issues or exchange
ideas. However, I expect the final product of each collected assignment to reflect individual thought
and composition. You may not copy or paraphrase from others' draft or final solutions. Examples
intended to clarify this policy follow. When in doubt, ask me!
Examples of acceptable collaborative efforts (applies only to this course):
• A student is confused about an ambiguous aspect of a case, and asks another student what s/he
      thinks.
• Students ask questions and share helpful insights in class or on Canvas.
Examples of collaborative efforts that are unacceptable:
• Student A completes a case before student B. B asks A for (or A simply provides to B) A's
      solution. B bases his/her solution on A's solution, in whole or in part. Both A and B are guilty of
      scholastic dishonesty.
• A student finds a source relevant to a case and copies extensively from it, without using quotation
      marks, indentation or other references to acknowledge the source. This example constitutes
      plagiarism, which is a clear case of scholastic dishonesty.
•    A student reviews a case solution (graded or ungraded) completed by another person
     in a prior semester.
• Any collaboration, breach of security or other cheating on a course examination.
