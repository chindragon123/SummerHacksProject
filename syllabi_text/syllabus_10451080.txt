   they’re all approximately one hour long. The quiz question(s) asked at the end will pertain to something the

GRADING POLICY
This is a Credit/No Credit course. As such, students will not receive credit for this class unless you complete
ALL course requirements by the specific deadlines set in the course syllabus.
In particular, your “grade” will be determined by the following criteria:
      1.  Did you complete all course assignments on time?
      2.  Did you complete at least 4 out of the 5 guest speaker assignments?
      3.  Did you show improvement between your midterm and your final supervisor evaluations?
          Your total supervisor evaluations (sum of mid-term and final evaluation) should be above 70%.
      4.  Did you submit a well-written, edited and honest final report by the deadline?
      5.  Did you notify the Internship Coordinator if your internship duties changed significantly?
COURSE POLICIES
Academic Integrity and Standards
Students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity in all course activities and
assignments. It is expected that there shall be no deception regarding the representation made by the student of
his/her preparation, participation or performance.
Plagiarism is presenting another person’s work as though it is one’s own and is a form of fraud. Plagiarism includes
(but is not limited to) the presentation of a sequence of words from another writer, utilized without proper
attribution. It is critical that students properly acknowledge the work of others and that the acknowledgement be
accurate and complete.
The remainder of the course requirements and policies relating to cheating and plagiarism are subject to the standard
policies and procedures for all UT-Austin students as established by UT-Austin.
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity,


honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Documented Disability Statement
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice)
or 232-2937 (video phone). Also, see http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/
Use of Canvas
In this class we will use Canvas—a Web-based course management system with password-protected access—to
distribute course materials, to communicate and collaborate online, to post grades, to distribute assignments, and to
give students online quizzes and surveys.
Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students
Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are responsible for reading
your email for university and course-related information and announcements. You are responsible to keep the
university informed about changes to your e-mail address. You should check your e-mail regularly and frequently—
I recommend daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related communications, some of
which may be time-critical. You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating your e-mail address at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in
order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time after the absence.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting in a disturbing manner, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice
Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a
partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the
Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050
or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is
activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation: Familiarize
yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the
one you used when you enter the building. If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the
first week class. In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors. Do not re-enter a
building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the
Fire Prevention Services Office.
Drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six (6). As
stated in Senate Bill 1231: “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not
permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has
dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than that
number.” You can find advice, models, templates, and other resources for designing your course syllabus on the


DIIA website at http://www.utexas.edu/academic/diia/
