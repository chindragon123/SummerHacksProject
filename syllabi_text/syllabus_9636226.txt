Course Description:
The purpose of EDC 370e: Teaching Elementary Physical Education is to provide students with the most
current evidence-based practices regarding elementary (grades K-6) physical education curriculum and
instruction. The students will be required to apply professional behaviors of effective teaching as identified in
the literature; create developmentally appropriate content; demonstrate task presentations; plan learning
experiences for others; and manage elementary physical education lessons, during an elementary field
experience. The content of this course is aligned with the Texas State Educator Certification Physical
Education Standards and Texas Essentials Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for physical education as a means of
developing professionals who are prepared to guide youth in becoming physically active and healthy for a
lifetime.

Rink, J. (2013). ​Teaching Physical Education for Learning ​(7th Ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill.
Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS). This document can be found at
http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/chapter116/ch116a.html​ and on Canvas in the files section.
*There will be additional required readings provided on Canvas*
Learning Experiences and Expectations:
EDC 370e is Monday through Friday and will provide opportunities for lectures, labs, and authentic field
experiences. Some of the lectures will be spent in physical activity in the gymnasium space at UT Austin, and


sometimes class meetings will be spent teaching elementary age students in and around Austin. Formal
lectures and labs will be held in BEL 348 or alternative locations, when necessary.
Lecture:
Each class will involve lecture, discussion, and group work based on the topics of each textbook chapter due
that day. ​Please read the assigned chapters and articles before each class.​ Proper preparation and active
participation during class enhances the learning experience for all students. ​Quizzes on the readings should
be expected.
Lab:
Some of the UT classes will be designated for participation in physical activity. During this time, lessons will
be modeled, personal movement skills developed, and students will have the opportunity to practice their own
teaching. Students should come to class dressed and prepared to be active. Comfortable clothing for
movement and athletic shoes are required.
Authentic Field Placements:
To make appropriate application of course material to real world settings, students will assist, observe, and
teach elementary age students in a school-like setting. The class will not meet at UT on specific days (as
indicated in the tentative course calendar) to provide time for these field experiences. ​All students will need
to complete a criminal background check to be allowed into the school-like setting. Please begin this
process immediately.
Transportation—  ​ Since field placements are out in schools, students will be responsible for arranging
transportation to that location. Please plan accordingly. Carpooling is always an option.
Responsibility - ​As future teachers, you are expected to comply with the same standards as teachers in the
schools. Please, see an example of what appropriate dress looks like, from the AISD dress code website:
http://www.edb.utexas.edu/education/edServices/fieldexp/resources/internmaterials/AISD​ dresscode
If illness or another emergency conflicts with your attendance, you need to notify the instructor of the
situation as soon as possible. ​The location we will visit, plans to specifically use your help during the lesson,
and it would be very unprofessional to not show up.
Please be proactive and communicate your situation to one of the instructors as soon as you can. Jeff can be
reached at 774-219-1369 (cell). Ashley can be reached at 623-217-8129 (cell).

Assignment Breakdown:
Teaching Cycles: ​In this course, there are 10 teaching cycles. A single cycle will require the student to plan an
elementary physical education lesson related to specific content; get the lesson approved by the instructor;
effectively teach the lesson; reflect on the teaching and learning in the lesson, and self-assess his/her teaching
performance. (the students will be required to complete 10 teaching cycle modules, each worth 25 points)
-Planning (10 points)
-Teaching (10 points)
-Reflection (5 points)
Exams:​ There will be two exams during this summer session. These exams will comprehensively cover
content from the readings, lectures, labs, and field experiences. The exams will contain a variety of questions
(e.g., multiple choice, matching, true or false, short answer, short essay, essay, interpretation of charts or
graphs). The instructor will try to provide a brief review, as time allows, during the class period before the
scheduled exam. (each exam is worth 50 points).
Instructional Unit Plan:​ To demonstrate long-term planning skills, the students will work together as a team
to create an instructional unit about a movement concept (approved by instructor). The scoring rubric for this
assignment can be found on Canvas. (30 points)
Quizzes:​ The instructors will check for understanding during formal class meetings. On selected occasions,
the students will be required to complete quizzes on the readings, or any other course content. There will be a
minimum of 7 quizzes during this summer session. (30 points)
Developmental Content Analysis: ​A developmental content analysis identifies the scope and sequence of a
particular sport or activity. This assignment requires the student to organize tasks to facilitate progressive
learning in elementary physical education. Each student will select a specific sport or activity and organize
their content by extending (changing the level of difficulty), refining (manipulating the task for student
success), and applying (assessment of a given task) the sequence of tasks to aid the student in developing


competency (a national standard) in this activity. The instructors will need to approve your selected topic. The
scoring rubric for this assignment can be found on Canvas. (30 points)
Micro Teaches: ​Students will create and teach two, 10-minute lessons to the other students in class. One
micro teach must implement technology and the other micro teach will be a regular lesson, without
technology. (20 points)
Professional Disposition:​ As a member of a pre-professional program, there are additional ethical and
professional standards of conduct expected of you. A professional dispositions rubric has been posted on
Canvas. Please, review this document prior to going out into the school-like setting. (10 points)
Professional Development (individualized plan): ​Students will reflect upon their Intern II Formative
Assessment conference and write a 1-2 page summary identifying areas of professional growth to better
prepare them for student teaching. Times New Roman, 12 point font, 1 inch margins, double-spaced. (30
points)
Additional Expectations:
-​Attendance​ during lectures and field experiences are essential. More than ​two (2) absences ​from this course
(including scheduled field experiences) will result in failure of this course. Absences beyond the two will
require university verification to be excused. The following reasons are examples of acceptable excuses: (a)
University supported activity (e.g., athletics), (b) extended hospitalization, or (c) death in the family. ​Two (2)
tardies (arriving after the class has started) will count as ​one (1) ​absence from class.
-Assignments are due electronically at 9:00 AM on scheduled class meeting dates. Late assignments will
NOT be accepted.
-Name tags ​MUST ​be worn at all times during field experiences.
University Notices and Policies:
Individual Performance Plan (IPP)​: In the event that your academic performance in 370S or fieldwork
anecdotal/formative evaluations indicate a need for specific goal-oriented improvement, an individual
performance plan will be designed for you and explained during a conference session. You are required to
meet with your course instructor and university facilitator every week to mark your progress towards the IPP
goals. It should be noted that you cannot receive a passing grade in the course if you do not satisfactorily
complete your fieldwork.
Documented Disability Statement: ​Any student with a documented disability who requires academic
accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or
1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty is not required to provide accommodations without an official

Plagiarism: ​Plagiarism and cheating will not be tolerated, and all university policies apply. Violation of this
policy includes but is not limited to, downloading lesson plans from the Internet claiming them as original
work, copying a classmate’s answers, or other claims of unoriginal work. If plagiarism or cheating is
suspected, then the student will be asked to meet with the instructor. A written statement will be forwarded to
the chairs of the Departments of Kinesiology and Health Education and Curriculum and Instruction. All
university academic integrity policies will be applied, and failure of the course will result. The software
Turnitin will be used in this class to confirm the authenticity of student work.
Academic Integrity University of Texas Honor Code: ​The core values of The University of Texas at Austin
are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the
university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward
peers and community. Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code.
Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's work. The University
defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, falsifying academic records,
and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty also
includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading information to receive a postponement or an
extension on a test, quiz, or another assignment, and submission of essentially the same written assignment for
two courses without prior permission of faculty members.
By accepting this syllabus and participating in the course, you have agreed to these guidelines and must
adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student’s learning experience and readiness for the
future demands of a work career. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject
to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and dismissal from The University.
