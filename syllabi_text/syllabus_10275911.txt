                                                     Practicum Description
Students at all levels are eligible—BBA students, MPA students, and MBA students. No accounting or tax background is
necessary. The course integrates community service and academic learning as follows:
Community service involves at least 55 volunteer hours
     - You will work with the Tax Help Program; a Foundation Communities’ program (www.foundcom.org) that partners
         with the IRS to implement the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program for low income filers.
Last year, Tax Help Program helped over 20,000 people and brought over $35,000,000 into the Austin economy in the form of
tax refunds and credits. This year we hope to increase those totals! This effort will require over 600 volunteers from UT and
the greater Austin area.
                                                      PLEASE RECALL
     IN THE COMMUNITY YOU’RE THE FACE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN
                                                     DO US ALL PROUD!
Academic learning comprises a multi-disciplinary curriculum addressing socio-economic issues facing members of the low-
income community.
     - Topics will be presented by experts in fields such as low-income housing, the use of data analytics, public policy,
         economic development, a day in the life of an IRS Special Agent, and volunteering in the community. In addition,
         training and certification to perform this community service activity will be provided.
                                                     Classroom Procedures
Teams and team leaders. The instructor will divide ACC 366P/384 students into teams. Each team will be led by two or three
graduate students. Team leaders will play a primary role in your in-class involvement and in your evaluation. Team leaders act as a
job manager and carry substantial responsibility. In addition to orchestrating your team meetings and activities and evaluating you,
they are your first source for inquiries and for feedback concerning in-class activities.
Guest speakers. The in-class segment of the practicum is primarily guest speakers or special presentations. Ample accounting
content arises in the volunteer component. Hence the academic segment strives to put your experience in a broader context by
discussing issues associated with the low-income community in the U.S. Distinguished guest speakers place an extra
responsibility on us and also introduce some special considerations, including the following.
• Courtesy and attentiveness toward our guests are essential. We are representing the University of Texas by our
     professionalism, involvement, politeness, punctuality, and all other aspects of our comportment!


•   Speaker characteristics may vary, including differing styles, abilities to engage, length of talks, depth of content, and the like.
    This is just one aspect of the pervasive diversity you will experience in this practicum and one over which there is limited
    control. In the end, it is everyone’s responsibility to make this practicum a meaningful experience.
•   There is a no laptop/smartphone policy during guest speakers, unless they ask you to use them.
•   Classroom protocol. The in-class model is as follows:
    • The first 45 minutes of class-time we will have team meetings
    • The remainder of our class-time will be with guest speakers or class activity
Communications and e-mail on Canvas: The use of e-mail and Canvas is required for this course. When sending class-wide
e-mails, I will use the e-mail addresses that are supplied to me on Canvas. However, any individual e-mails I send to you will
be done via Outlook and those e-mail addresses are all McCombs addresses.
Any outside-of-class announcements that I make (e.g., syllabus changes, assignment changes, speaker date changes, etc.) will
be sent to you via e-mail or on Canvas. It is possible that substantial content will be posted on Canvas or sent via e-mail. It is
your responsibility to regularly check your e-mail (both your McCombs account and any other accounts that you might have set
up for forwarding) and the class Canvas site.

Course Completion Requirements in Detail
1. IRS Training and Certification (without which there is nothing) (10%) requirements:
       a.   Complete an 8-hour basic training session (outside class time, on January 24th or 25th) and 6 hours of advanced
            training (during class time In February) offered through the Tax Help Program that covers tax law principles
            and how to use TaxSlayer software (also referred to as IRS training). You will also be required to take HSA
            (health savings account training) online. The training is required even if you have participated in the program
             and passed the tests in the past.
       b. Become certified as a tax preparer by passing both the Basic and Advanced IRS certification tests and also
            completing the HSA training. The website address to complete the tests will be given during our IRS Training
            sessions. There are mandatory due dates to complete each of these certifications (see Course schedule).
            Your username to take the tests needs to be “last-name.first-name”. Please use your last and first name as they
            appear on my official class roster. A grade of F will be assigned if not certified by 2 weeks following each
             certificate deadline (Course schedule).
       c. Keep a digital copy of each certificate and E-mail a copy to UTTraining@foundcom.org as follows:
                      Basic/HSA Certificate by 11:59pm on January 31st
                      Advanced Certificate by 11:59pm on February 17th.
                      Take a signed paper copy of Form 13615 (volunteer agreement), which is proof of your
                      certification to every site where you volunteer. Bring it with you to your first shift at each tax
                      site. Whenever you complete a new level of certification, bring an updated copy of your
                      agreement. (This should happen twice – once after you certify for Basic & HSA, and the second
                      time after you certify to the advanced level).
   (J don’t the students need to bring a hard copy to the first site? Do they submit to us too?)
2. Community Service Requirements (30%)
       a. Register with the Tax Help Program as a volunteer by the first day of the semester
       b. Self-select volunteer hours on the Tax Help Program web-based scheduler.
       Perform at least 55 hours of volunteer work as a tax preparer plus any required penalty hours (discussed later in this
       syllabus). Graduate student requirements are discussed later in this syllabus.
       c.   Tax Help Program (THP) site manager evaluations and completing volunteering hours
            THP Evaluations
            Site managers will provide input to the instructor regarding each student’s:
       •    Quality of work, attitude, professionalism, and punctuality. Unless instructed otherwise, talking or texting on
            cell phones is NOT permitted at ANY time when in the tax centers, even when you are not with a client. If
            you need to take or send an emergency call or text, please step outside briefly to do so.
       •    Effectiveness of THP client interface and comportment, including adhering to the dress code below
       •    Quality of interaction with site colleagues, and did you bring the proper materials with you
       •    Proper dress – When you are at the Tax Help sites, you are not only representing the University of Texas and
            Foundation Communities, you will also be providing a customer service. Please dress appropriately when you
            show up to volunteer.
            Acceptable dress consists of business casual, jeans, and UT t-shirts. Please note that the only t-shirts allowed
            are UT t-shirts. All other t-shirts are NOT allowed. Fraternity and sorority t-shirts are NOT considered UT t-
            shirts per this syllabus and are thus NOT allowed.
            Unacceptable dress: Non-UT t-shirts, fraternity or sorority t-shirts, shorts, yoga pants, leggings as pants,
            workout clothes, hats, pajamas and flip-flops. This is not necessarily a complete list.
       •    Downtime in between clients or when client volume is slow should be spent asking your site manager which
            administrative tasks can be helped with or done. Downtime or idle time should NOT be spent studying for
            other classes, texting, using social media or viewing the internet on your phone or computer, etc.
3. Class Preparation and Participation (20% Undergraduates)
   Your team leaders will evaluate you every class (Daily Grade) based on the following scale: (Do not use half points)
       2 = excellent
       1 = satisfactory


              0 = unsatisfactory, absent, partially absent, or unprofessional
       In order to earn all 20% for this component of your grade, your Daily Grade average for all classes must be 1.0 or higher.
       Your evaluation will be based on the following criteria, which by their nature, contain elements of subjectivity.
       (A)   Daily Grades / Class day without a speaker
       •    The quality and quantity of your contributions in class.
       •    Your attendance in and punctuality to class.
       •    Other subjective criteria the group leaders determine
       •    Your general behavior with me and other students.
       (B)   Daily Grades / Class with a speaker
       •    Speaker write-up (see below for details)
       •    The quality and quantity of your contributions in class.
       •    Your willingness and effectiveness to articulate questions during the speakers’ sessions.
       •    Your attendance in and punctuality to class, whether it begins with your group meeting and/or the speaker’s
            presentation.
       •    Other subjective criteria the group leaders determine
       Speaker Write-Ups
       For days with a speaker: by 3:00 on the day of class, you are to submit a 250-word minimum write-up of the current
       week’s speaker’s topic. Your write-up will be graded by your team leaders. To earn the highest grade of “2” for the
       class, in addition to the other class criteria, your speaker write-up must be of high quality and at least 500 words. Factors
       that might play into the rating of each speaker write-up might include, but are not limited to, the following:
         • Topicality/Interest/Clarity of Expression
         • Relevance to the topic, and
         • The quality and quantity of relevant underlying research (include reference sources)
         All speaker write-ups MUST be e-mailed to your group leaders in a Word document. (Group leaders – Word
         counts the number of words in the document for you, thus there is no need to manually count yourself.) Speaker write-
         ups in any other form (ex. hand-written) will not be accepted.
         Please note that copying material from a website without attribution for your speaker write-up constitutes cheating
         under The Code of Conduct for the McCombs School of Business. Further, even with full attribution, a cut/paste job
         does not constitute your work for this purpose.
GRADUATE STUDENTS. All team leaders of the group must meet and assign one grade for the day for each undergraduate
team member. Each undergraduate’s daily grade is due to the course TA, Alyssa Suddhi, via e-mail by 11:59 PM the day of
class (one email per group). I highly recommend that you meet right after class, determine the grades, and send them to Alyssa
Suddhi before you leave the classroom. Students that are caught sleeping, laying their head down, texting, talking, not paying
attention, or acting unprofessional during a speaker should receive a zero for that day. Graduate students will be graded based
on attendance only for this category. Please list your attendance on your daily email to Alyssa Suddhi, the course TA.
    4. Significant Impressions Paper and Discussion (10%)
You are to complete a two-page paper which documents the three most meaningful aspects of your volunteer experience. The
paper is due at the beginning of class on April 14th. Group leaders will facilitate a team discussion during our last class session.
Following the team meetings, team members will make a brief presentation to the entire class summarizing the top two-to-four
experiences among your team members.
At the conclusion of this class session you will hand-in your Significant Impressions paper to the team leaders for evaluation.
The instructor will also evaluate this paper. This is your take-away from the volunteer experience so there are no right or wrong
answers. At the same time, meaningful thought and effort should be put into your ideas. The evaluation you receive on this
paper will be based on factors such as, but not limited to, the following
       • Thoroughness of your ideas. They may tie to cited research or our guest speaker’s comments, but this is not
            necessary.
    • Quality of grammatical expression, spelling and organization (use headings if useful).
    • Your attendance in class that day and your participation in the group and class presentations


The Significant Impressions paper should:
     • Be no longer than two pages (8.5” x 11”), double-spaced,
     • Have one inch margins, and
     • Use Times Roman 12 font.
Your Significant Impressions paper will be rated by your team leaders. The same 0-3 scale that was applied to your Speaker
Write Ups will be used : (Do not use half points)
                   2 = excellent
                   1 = satisfactory
                   0 = unsatisfactory, not turned in or turned in late
In order to earn the full 10% for this component of your grade, your Significant Impressions paper grade must be 1 or higher.
However, do not take this to mean there is no advantage to writing a paper that earns a grade of 2. At the end of the semester if
you are on the borderline of a grade cutoff (ex. A and A-, A- and B+, etc.) a score of 2 on your Significant Impressions paper
could very well be the deciding factor in your final grade.
GRADUATE STUDENTS. The leadership role you are being asked to play in this activity is the following (you must write a
Significant Impressions paper too):
1. Group leaders will facilitate a discussion within your team addressing the team’s experiences. Following this team
     meeting, designated member(s) from your team will take a few minutes to share with the entire class key experiences among
     your team members.
2. At the conclusion of class, undergraduate students will submit their Significant Impressions paper to the team leaders for
     evaluation by you on a numeric scale of 0-2 (use the grading standards as stated above.) Each team leader will evaluate
     the papers independently. Please clearly mark all team leader grades on the front page (if 2 leaders, there should be 2
     grades etc.). Each team leader should also use a different color pen to write comments throughout the paper. I anticipate
     the vast majority to be scores of 1, with only obvious outliers being 0’s and 2’s. Evaluations should be made based on the
     quality of insight and impression.
3. Your evaluation of the students’ Significant Impressions papers will be turned into the course TA, Alyssa Suddhi by noon on
     Monday, April 27 for evaluation. You need to keep these grades in your own semester gradebook.
At the conclusion of class on April 14th, graduate students will submit your Significant Impressions paper to Alyssa Suddhi for
grading.
     5. Instructor’s discretionary evaluation (15%)
The instructor will rely upon all assessment inputs from team leaders and independent evaluations as indicated above and
below. In the event the instructor has additional information, or assesses a student’s performance differently than others, she
maintains the right to exercise discretionary decision making when assigning final grades. Absent additional or contradictory
insights, the instructor will allocate these discretionary points in a manner consistent with the overall evaluation for all
activities. This grade category will be heavily influenced by your volunteering performance and what occurs in the tax centers
(including how you represent the University of Texas).
     6. Thesis paper (15% Undergraduates)
To earn a course grade of “B+”, “A-“, or “A” you must write a rigorous thesis paper pertaining to a speaker related topic,
whether proposed formally or informally by the speaker, your team leaders, the instructor, or you. This paper is not required for
a grade of “B” or below, but it is required for a grade above a “B.” The topic must be approved by your team leaders by
Tuesday April 7th. The thesis paper is due at noon on Friday, May 1st in 4M.202. Thesis papers must also be uploaded to
Canvas by noon on Friday, May 1st. The thesis paper should:
     • Be no longer than 10 pages (8.5” x 11”), double-spaced, (not including exhibits and works cited)
     • Be no shorter than 8 pages (8.5” x 11”), double-spaced,
     • Have one inch margins,
     • Use Times Roman 12 font type,
     • Your thesis statement must be clearly stated at the end of your first paragraph.
     • Use MLA citation format
Papers will be evaluated by your team leaders and by the instructor based on, but not limited to, the following:
     • Thoroughness and credibility of research, authority, and citations,
     • Relationship to guest speaker topics,
     • Quality of arguments and conclusions,
     • Quality of organization, and


    •    Quality of grammatical expression.
GRADUATE STUDENTS. Your role with the thesis papers is to:
a. Approve topics.
b. Serve as a sounding board, advisor, and potential recommender of topics to your team members.
c. Provide the following evaluation:
    1. Rank each thesis paper. The best thesis paper should be ranked #1.
    2. Assign a letter grade (A-F; +/- may be used if you desire) to each thesis paper.
d. All team leaders will read all team members’ papers and clearly indicate their grade on the first page. Please use different
    color pens when making comments.
e. All graded papers must be submitted to class TA, Alyssa Suddhi, by noon on Friday May 1st.
    7. Administration and Leadership (35% Graduates)
This will include, but is not limited to:
- Accurately and timely sending me the daily grades by the deadline stated above
- Grading speaker write-ups appropriately and the quality of your evaluation of undergraduate thesis papers
- At the end of every class that has a group meeting you and your co-leader will turn in to me your lesson plan for that day.
  Lesson plans should be no longer than one page, double-spaced, have one inch margins, and use Times Roman 12 font.
  Handwritten lesson plans will not be accepted.
- Your completion of a rigorous thesis paper as described above OR completing an extra 8 hours of volunteer time.
- The quality of your role, if requested in students’ feedback on their thesis paper.
