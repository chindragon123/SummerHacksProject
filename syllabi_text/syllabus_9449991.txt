COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course is a lecture / lab course designed to introduce students to the basic concepts, methods,
and systems utilized in the field of Live Entertainment. The primary focus is to explore core
technologies and illuminate how each area of work within Projection, Lighting and interactivity relates
and is connected to others. Through a mixture of lectures and lab classes the students will be
introduced to the tools and techniques prevalent in four specific applications of Live Entertainment:
projection, conventional & intelligent lighting, 3-D previsualization, and interactive & generative
imagery. Topics include the historical landmarks of interactive performance, projection system
design, media servers, common signal and data formats, imagery creation for live performance, and
current trends in live event technology. Student activities include: programming lights, controlling
media servers, and designing an interactive projection system.
LEARNING OUTCOMES:
By the end of the semester, students should be able to:
• apply principles and elements of design;
• create and implement original design ideas;
• effectively troubleshoot an interactive system;
• critically examine projection techniques
COURSE MATERIALS:
•   8GB maximum USB drive
•   Pencil
•   1 – notebook (small or medium in size, easily accessible for notetaking and may be used during
    quizzes)
COURSE REQUIREMENTS:
• Quizzes (10%): A total of 5 quizzes will be administered throughout the semester.
•   Project 1 (20%):   QLab – performance
•   Project 2 (15%):   LightConverse – lighting previsualization
•   Project 3 (20%):   Hog 4 – performance
•   Project 4 (15%):   disguise – projection previsualization
•   Project 5 (20%):   disguise – 3D mapping performance

If you submit your assignment late it will not be reviewed in class.
All work is due as specified in the assignment listed in canvas. Work not completed prior to the
canvas deadline will be considered late.
Any work turned in late, regardless of the excuse, will result in a grade reduction of one full letter for
each calendar date it is late (an A would become a B and so on).
In summary:
Every assignment has a due date and time.
I do accept work after the due date, however, assignments automatically lose one full letter
grade for every calendar date submitted late and they will not be reviewed in class.
Any work turned in more than 4 calendar days late will receive an automatic F. If you are having difficulty
completing your work on time, please speak to me privately prior to the deadline, so we may discuss a
possible arrangement.
                       All assignments will be graded within 7 days of submission date.
Grading Scheme
A- Represents outstanding participation in all course activities. All assigned work must be completed
on time and with a very high quality of demonstrated skill and technique. There is an evidence of
significant development across all dimensions of learning. The result at this level demonstrates activity
that goes significantly beyond the required course work in one or more areas.
B- Represents excellent participation in all course activities; all assigned work must be completed on
time with consistently high quality in course work. There is an evidence of marked development
across all dimensions of learning.
C- Represents good participation in all course activities; all assigned work completed, with generally
good quality in course work. There is evidence of some development across all dimensions of
learning.
D- Represents uneven participation in all course activities; some gaps in assigned work completed,
with inconsistent quality in course work. The evidence of development across all dimensions of
learning is unclear.
F- Represents minimal participation in all course activities; serious gaps in assigned work completed,
or very low quality in course work. Development evidence is not available.
Please Note: If you are concerned about your grade – check in with us regularly so that we can
determine where you’re at, and what might need to be done to correct any problems. Do not wait
until the end of the semester!

ATTENDANCE:
ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY - Being a professional requires a habit of discipline and rigor.
Professionals in the arts achieve at the highest level when they work with determination and
dedication to detail. Your attention to attendance and lecture information gathering is an important
element of establishing professional standards and practices. The course lectures and discussions will
involve a significant amount of information that will not be available in any other form (textbook,
handouts); therefore, regular attendance is necessary for successful completion of the class.
If you need to miss class for legitimate reasons it is your responsibility to contact me directly with this
information. Sending a message by way of another student of an impending absence does not
constitute a legitimate notification.
For each unexcused absence after your first three, your final grade will be lowered by one letter
grade. Seven unexcused absences constitute an automatic F in the class.
Please be on time for class. If you are more than 5 minutes late for class you will be counted as
tardy. Every two instances you are tardy will be counted as one time absent.
Privacy
What we say about each other’s work during this class should remain constructive and in the
classroom. It will not be published in a blog or on any other personal website, tweeted, or posted on
social networks. Please respect each other’s work.
