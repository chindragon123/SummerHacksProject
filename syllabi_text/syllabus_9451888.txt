MEMORANDUM FOR: ALL STUDENTS IN AFROTC
FROM: Operations Flight Commander (OFC)
SUBJECT: Welcome Letter
Welcome to AFROTC Detachment 825, home of the Longhorn Airmen! This syllabus will
explain the requirements that you must fulfill in order to pass Leadership Laboratory (LLAB).
LLAB is an integral and mandatory portion of the Aerospace Studies curriculum, providing a
progression of experiences designed to develop each student's leadership potential. LLAB,
which includes Physical Training (PT), gives you practical, hands-on command and staff
leadership experiences within the framework of the 825th Cadet Wing.
The first two years of LLAB are considered the General Military Course (GMC) and involve
activities described as Initial Leadership Experiences: learning Air Force customs and
courtesies, drill and ceremonies, military commands, and teamwork. Cadets will also study the
environment of an Air Force base and learn about career opportunities available to a
commissioned officer.
The last two years in the program are called the Professional Officer Course (POC) and consist
of Advanced Leadership and Management Experiences, including the planning, staffing,
organizing, coordinating, leading, and controlling functions within the Cadet Corps. POC
cadets prepare and present briefings, write communications, and conduct interviews. POC
cadets also provide the guidance and information necessary to maintain a high level of
motivation, performance, and esprit de corps within the Cadet Wing.
GENERAL MILITARY COURSE (GMC)
The freshman cadet (AS 100) attends two hours of LLAB, two hours of physical training, and
one hour of academic class per week each semester. The class "Foundations of the Air Force"
covers history and heritage, organization and mission, careers and benefits of the Air Force.
The sophomore cadet (AS 200) curriculum likewise consists of two hours of LLAB, two
hours of physical training, and one hour of class per week each semester. The class
"Evolution of USAF Air & Space Power History" traces the history of air power from when
hot air balloons were used for reconnaissance through present day space exploration.
PROFESSIONAL OFFICER COURSE (POC)
The junior cadet (AS 300) attends two hours of LLAB, two hours of physical training, and three
hours of academic class, per week each semester. The "Leadership Studies" class examines
leadership and management principles and techniques.
Senior cadets (AS 400) attend two hours of LLAB, two hours of physical training, and three
hours of academic class, per week each semester. Their "National Security Affairs” class is an
examination of military professionalism and existing patterns of civil-military relations, an
                                                                                                   2


analysis of international and domestic environments affecting US defense policy; and an
extensive study of variables involved in the formulation and implementation of national
security policy and military law.
For LLAB purposes, cadets are classified into one of the following five groups:
IMT = Initial Military Training = AS cadets not competing for Field Training (FT)
FTP = Field Training Prep = Cadets who will be competing for a summer 2012 FT slot
ICL = Intermediate Cadet Leader = Cadets who completed FT and will commission during
FY 14 or later
SCL = Senior Cadet Leader = Cadets who completed FT and one year of ICL
ECL = Extended Cadet Leader = Cadets who have completed entire AS curriculum and are
waiting to graduate
The mission of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) detachments
located at colleges and universities throughout the United States is “to develop quality leaders
for the Air Force.” That is our detachment’s priority.
Good luck as you prepare to take this important step in your Air Force career, a career of
service to our great nation!

Attendance Policy and Rules of Engagement:
I expect you to make the effort to attend 100% of the Leadership Labs (LLAB). Learning is maximized
when you are in class with your peers.
When you must miss class for a valid unavoidable circumstance notify me as soon as possible, but no
later than before class start time. In case of unexpected circumstances (i.e., emergencies), you should
notify me no later than 24 hours after class session. Alternate requirements or makeup activities will be
arranged for the criteria listed below:
         1. Participation in an approved field trip or other official University activity (e.g., athletics,
          debate, music, theater arts, AFROTC physical). Note: Fraternity and/or sorority functions are not
          official University activities
         2. Sickness or medical confinement
         3. An emergency (e.g., death in the family, automobile accident)
Administrative Requirement:
Regardless of circumstance, if you miss LLAB or do not attend two PT sessions in a week, email your
cadet chain of command and/or submit an Excused Absence Request Form (EARF) as soon as possible. If
you are a crosstown student and your school is not in session, you are not required to come to any
Practical Military Training (PMT); however, you may choose to come voluntarily.
                                                                                                            4


Grading Criteria:
LLAB is graded on a pass/fail basis and is a mandatory class for all AFROTC cadets. A
merit/demerit system will not be used. You must pass LLAB to remain in AFROTC and to be eligible for
an Air Force Officer Commission. To receive a passing grade in LLAB, you must meet the following
criteria:
          1. LLAB ATTENDANCE: You must attend at least 80% of LLAB. The expectation is that you
            will attend (or be excused from) 100% of LLAB. If you are under 80% you will fail LLAB.
            Attendance rosters will be maintained for LLAB and PT sessions.
          -   Note: You are not required to attend LLAB or PT if your academic institution (Austin
              Community College, Concordia University, St. Edwards University, or another institution
              with which Detachment 825 has a crosstown arrangement) is not in session. You will work
              these attendance exceptions on a case by case basis with your instructor.
          -   Note: There will be LLAB events scheduled throughout the semester at different times other
              than Tuesday and Thursday from 1100-1200. The following list is potential events occurring
              at additional times, all of which will be mandatory if occurring during a scheduled LLAB
              (e.g. Career Day).
                   a. Career Day
                   b. Dining-In/Out Education
                   c. Parade/Open House
          -   Note: There may be voluntary events throughout the year that can contribute to your
              leadership development, team building and esprit de corps. While valuable, these events
              are voluntary (non-PMT) and will be clearly delineated as such. Do not confuse
              mandatory and voluntary, and if you have questions about the distinction, please discuss
              with cadre. Participation in non-PMT or other voluntary activities not sponsored by
              AFROTC and any injuries could result in loss of AFROTC status and benefits. The Air
              Force is not liable for medical care when cadets participate in non-AFROTC
              sponsored events.
          -
          2. PHYSICAL FITNESS (PT): To remain in AFROTC, you must attend Physical Training (PT)
                   sessions, maintain all physical fitness standards including passing the Physical Fitness
                   Assessment (PFA) and maintain height and weight standards.
            PT SESSIONS: Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 0600-0700 at Clark Field or the
            Recreational Sports Center (RSC).
          - Note: All cadets (including cross-town cadets) are required to attend two scheduled PT
            sessions per week unless your most recent PFA score is below 90.0, in which case you
            will be required to attend all three scheduled PT sessions per week. Additionally you
            MUST attend at least 80% of all scheduled PT sessions overall. If you are below 80%
            attendance you will fail PT and LLAB and will be subject to dismissal from the program.
            Students in special circumstances (e.g. intercollegiate athletes) may discuss case-by-case
            exceptions to this policy with the LLAB instructor.
          - Cadets must complete an official PFA each semester to pass LLAB. The PFA consists of
            four parts: abdominal circumference measurement, push-ups, sit-ups, and a 1.5-mile run.
                                                                                                            5


           Procedures and standards will be clearly demonstrated before you take the PFA. All contract
           cadets must pass the official PFA. All non-contract cadets must make satisfactory progress
           towards meeting PFA standards.
                  o   The following constitutes failing to make satisfactory progress:
                      Failure to attempt an official PFA
                      Three consecutive official PFA failures; or
                      Any official PFA failure after having passed a PFA
         3. RECEPTIVITY TO MILITARY TRAINING: You are to be actively engaged in your
           leadership development and not show indifference to military training. The following behaviors
           will result in a failing grade for LLAB:
                  a. Lack of commitment to the Honor Code.
                  b. Poor performance, poor attitude, or lack of military bearing or appearance.
                  c. Persistently missing suspense dates and times.
                  d. Demonstrating a consistent indifference to military training, as determined by the
                  Operations Flight Commander
                              AFROTC Cadet Responsibilities and Guidelines
Academic Retention Standards:
ALL cadets must maintain a full time status of 12.0 credit hours (exceptions for final semester in
AFROTC program).
ALL cadets must pass LLAB.
ALL cadets must pass all Aerospace Studies courses
ALL cadets must remain in good standing at their institution.
ALL cadets should discuss with their AS instructor in advance any plans to drop classes (if you will drop
below full-time status) or change majors.
Scholarship cadets must maintain full-time status and a term and cumulative GPA of 2.50 or greater.
All non-contract cadets must maintain full-time status and a 2.00 term and cumulative GPA to remain
in good standing.
FTP cadets must have a minimum 2.00 cumulative GPA to compete for an enrollment allocation, and
must have a minimum term GPA of 2.0 in the semester prior to attending Field Training.
Failure to meet the academic retention standards will result in placement on probation and the receipt of
an academic conditional event. Suspension or termination of your AFROTC scholarship or disenrollment
action may occur.
Reporting Medical and/or Civil Involvements:
Because of stringent physical qualifications necessary to enter the Air Force and certain career fields,
cadets are required to report any medical changes to the cadre no matter how minor. The following are
examples of a medical change: surgery, breaking or fracturing bones, allergies, severe sprains or muscle
pulls which result in inability to run or perform the PFA, and pregnancy.
The Air Force is not liable for medical care when cadets participate in non-AFROTC/non-PMT sponsored
events such as THUDS events or Arnold Air Society events. These entities are distinct from AFROTC
and are not sponsored by AFROTC. Involvement in these groups has no bearing on your fulfillment of
                                                                                                          6


AFROTC graduation and commissioning requirements. Additionally, any injuries that you sustain
resulting from these activities could result in loss of AFROTC status and benefits.
         ***NOTE*** Participation in non-PMT, voluntary activities are not sponsored by AFROTC and
           any injuries could result in loss of AFROTC status and benefits***
         ***NOTE*** The Air Force is not liable for medical care when cadets participate in non-
           AFROTC sponsored events.***
You must report all negative civil, military, or school involvements to the detachment NCOs within 72
hours. If the incident occurs during a school break lasting longer than 72 hours, cadets may wait to report
the involvement NLT 72 hours after their return to classes following the break.
Drugs & Alcohol:
No use of illicit drugs or abuse of prescription drugs is allowed, period. No alcohol consumption is
allowed unless you are of legal age. Be responsible—do not abuse alcohol and never drive while or after
drinking.
Uniform Wear:
Wear your uniform proudly and properly. You must maintain grooming and weight standards to wear the
uniform. On LLAB days, you are expected to wear the uniform of the day (as specified in the day’s
Operations Orders) from 0800 to 1630. The only exception is if you have a laboratory class where you
could damage your uniform (i.e. chemistry, concrete design, etc.) you can wear appropriate civilian
clothes during the class period. You must change back into your uniform after the class. The Detachment
located on the fifth floor of CLA is considered your duty location; you are expected to comply with
grooming standards in and out of uniform while in the building.
You must maintain Air Force standards of appearance, leadership, self-discipline, and behavior at all
times, even outside of the classroom. You cannot wear any uniform items provided to you by the Air
Force while conducting fundraising activities.
All cadets are required to adhere to all regulations outlined in AFI 36-2903 and AFI 36-2903 AFROTC
Supplement regarding proper uniform wear.
Fraternization Policy:
Fraternization will not be tolerated. You are all college students and have the right to date other college
students. The definition of fraternization is as follows:
         1. Any conduct that compromises the chain-of-command. Cadets are specifically forbidden from
          using their rank or position to take or be perceived as taking, undue advantage of subordinates.
          You should refrain from dating other cadets within your chain of command.
         2. Any appearance of partiality exhibited by one cadet to another which might be construed by
          others as resulting from a social relationship.
         3. Any conduct that disrupts the good order, discipline, or morale of the corps.
                                                                                                            7


         4. Cadets may date other cadets, regardless of rank, so long as a professional attitude is
          maintained at the detachment and all corps-related activities, formal or informal.
         5. The cadre will deal directly with any behavior that suggests fraternization.
Harassment, Hazing, and Assault Policy:
Detachment 825 has zero tolerance for harassment, hazing, and assault. The United States Air Force
does not and will not tolerate any mistreatment or indignity due to race, sex, or religious belief. Any
member of the United States Air Force, active duty or cadet, who is found violating the Equal
Opportunity policies of the United States Air Force will be punished to the maximum extent allowed by
regulation. Members of Detachment 825 are specifically forbidden from using their grade or position to
take undo advantage of, or inflict cruelty on subordinates. This includes but is not limited to hazing,
indignity, oppression, sexual harassment, or deprivation of any right or privilege to which any individual
is legally entitled. Any cadet who violates this policy on harassment will be subject to disciplinary
actions. Detachment 825 has zero tolerance for hazing. Hazing is neither honorable nor respectful
behavior. Hazing is inconsistent with military order. Cadets are specifically forbidden from using their
rank or position to take, or be perceived as taking, undue advantage of subordinates. Cadets are prohibited
from maltreating each other, including physical and/or verbal maltreatment, physical contact, physical
discipline, maltraining, discrimination, sexual or other types of harassment, hazing, disrespectful
treatment or language, oppression, abusive initiations or rites of passage, or deprivation of any right or
privilege to which they are legally entitled as cadets or students.
Each cadet must sign a DD Form 2983 (accessible at https://utexas.box.com/v/DD2983),
Recruit/Trainee Prohibited Activities Acknowledgment, and an Air University Form 19, AU MAC
Student Standards of Conduct Training Agreement, before beginning classes in the Detachment.
Classroom Conduct:
         1. When a ranking officer/instructor enters the classroom, students will stand and come to
          attention until told to be seated by the officer. When the officer prepares to leave the classroom,
          the students must again come to attention until dismissed or until the officer leaves the
          classroom. Class members will select a class monitor and alternate who will make these
          announcements for all class sessions. When an officer below the rank of O-6 enters the room
          during class and a military instructor is already teaching, the room will not be called to attention.
          Cadets will always call the room to attention when an officer at the grade of O-6 or higher enters
          the room.
         2. You are not required to stand or raise your hand when contributing to class discussions but you
          must be respectful of others at all times. You will properly address the instructor as sir/ma’am or
          by rank (e.g., Captain, Major, Colonel) and address NCOs as sergeant.
         3. No eating, smoking, or use of other tobacco products while in class.
         4. During class, cell phones will be turned off.
         5. No use of laptops during class, except for note taking capabilities or course-related reasons.
                                                                                                                8

                       Classroom Evacuation Instruction:
   1. Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
        buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
        assembling outside.
   2. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
        Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
   3. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
        week of class.
   4. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
   5. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: The University of Texas at
        Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
