Course Description
This course seeks to familiarize students with a basic outline of Greek history and introduce
them to the role of the Greeks in influencing literature, philosophy, performing arts, architecture,
and politics. This course will use primary texts as a way of investigating the cultural legacy of
the Greeks starting with the Minoans and ending with the Hellenistic period. The structure of this
course centers on lecture and primary source discussions. Lecture will allow for a more directed
outline in this intensive summer course, while discussion will play an important role due to the
relatively small size of this summer course.
Course Prerequisite
None.
Objectives
Upon the completion of this course, you will be able to:
    • Identify the major sites, art, and architecture of the ancient Greeks
    • Understand a general timeline of ancient Greek history
    • Discuss trends of ancient Greek literature
    • Have a thorough knowledge of how the Greeks impacted our world

*N.B. I will not round up percentage points (e.g. if you earn an 89.6, your grade will be a B+ etc.)
Pass/Fail or Credit/No Credit Option
A student may choose to take the course as Pass/Fail (undergrads only) or Credit/No Credit
(grads only). To receive a pass, a final grade of D- or better is required. To receive credit, a final
grade of C or better is required.
Participation and Discussion (10%)
Students should expect daily reading assignments. Most of these will not be turned in, but we
will go over them in class. Failure to prepare adequately for class will severely inhibit your
ability to understand the materials covered in this course and will negatively impact your
participation grade. Students should expect sizeable reading assignments on most weekends.
To receive participation credit, I expect the following:
         • You have read the assigned reading before coming to class
         • You are present with all of the required course materials
         • You volunteer your ideas and answer questions posed by the instructor
         • You do not disrupt the class environment either by a lack of respect for your classmates
         and instructor or by disregarding the electronics policy
Daily Quizzes and Attendance (20%)
                                                        4


                                                                Mignanelli¨CC f301¨Summer 2019
There will be daily quizzes throughout the semester. These quizzes are short check-ins both to
help me understand what parts of the material you are struggling with and also to keep you on
track. These quizzes will be held at the beginning of class and last no more than 5 minutes. If
you show up late, you will only have the time that remains of that 5 minutes to complete the
quiz. Regardless of whether you miss a quiz because you are late or absent, there will be NO
make-up quizzes offered. However, I will drop the 2 lowest quiz scores from the final calculation
of your grade. These quizzes will cover both questions about the reading for that day and lecture
from the previous class day.
Lastly, these quizzes also reflect your attendance in the class. Attendance is crucial to your
success in this class and even if you do not believe you have adequately prepared for the daily
quiz, you should still attend and take the quiz.
Play Response Paper (10%)
Students will write a two-page (double-spaced) response to a play from the perspective of an
assigned member of Athenian society. The instructor will provide a rubric and information sheet
about the member of Athenian society on June 21st. Students are encouraged to meet with the
instructor to discuss both the play (of their choosing) and the paper. Creative responses (written
in 1st person) are welcome! Paper is due on Monday, July 8th at the beginning of class. Please
bring a physical copy.
Exams (60%)
There will be 4 exams during the semester. Each exam will assess your knowledge of the history,
literature, culture, art, architecture, and geography of ancient Greece. Each exam will have 5
sections as follows: Multiple Choice (on readings and lecture), Term IDs (drawn from lecture),
Mapping, Art and Architecture ID (based on material covered each section), and a Passage
Commentary (drawn from one of that section’s readings). As exam dates get closer, I will review
with you the structure of the exam as well as the material you will be responsible for.
Students will only be allowed to make up exams in the case of a demonstrated medical reason
(physician’s statement required) or other unavoidable emergency (as certified by the Dean of
Students in the student’s college). Examples of unacceptable excuses: family trips, oversleeping,
laziness, tardiness, hangovers, etc. The final exam must be taken at the appointed time: no make-
ups or early taking will be allowed.
What do I do if I feel like I am falling behind?
Come see me! This course is fast-paced. If there is anything you do not understand, come to my
office hours, email me, or see me before or after class. Be prepared to spend approximately
THREE HOURS outside of class for every hour in class. Even when there is not an assignment,
you should be reviewing material.
Course Policies
Electronic Devices
Electronic devices (laptops, tablets, etc.) are allowed in this class ONLY for the purpose of note-
taking. If you are going to use an electronic device to take notes, I ask that you turn off the wi-fi
                                                    5


                                                               Mignanelli¨CC f301¨Summer 2019
function on the device. Cell phones need to be silenced and in your bag during class. If I see you
texting, checking updates, or using your phone in any way during class, you will automatically
lose your participation points for the day. You will only have ONE warning for the entire
semester. If you are expecting an important phone call or for some other valid reason need to use
an electronic device, please come and speak with me before class.
Email Policy
Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, it is your
responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in your email address. You are also
expected to check email on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-
and course-related communications, recognizing that some emails may be time-critical. Be sure
to check your settings on Canvas to ensure that you are getting email notifications for this class. I
will often post updates and nightly assignments via Canvas announcements.
Further, when sending me an email, I ask that you follow these simple guidelines:
    1. A proper salutation (“Dear Michael” or “Hello Michael” should suffice)
    2. A clear subject line (midterm, class today, quiz, etc.)
    3. Be concise
    4. Check grammar, punctuation, and spelling
    5. Signature (first and last name)
I normally check my email between 9-5pm Monday through Friday. I occasionally check my
email during the weekend. On weekends I will only respond if I deem the matter to be urgent.
University Policies
The instructor abides by all policies described in the university’s General Information Bulletin,
including, but not limited to those listed below. To examine the University’s General

cheating in any way will receive no credit on the assignment/test and will be subject to the
University procedures under Appendix C, Section 11 of the General Information bulletin. I
reserve the right to reexamine any student whom I strongly suspect of cheating or facilitating
