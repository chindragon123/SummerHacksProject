Unique #: 79830                                                         Flags: Global Cultures, Writing
Semester: Summer 2020, second session                                   Restrictions: See prerequisites below
Cross Lists: None
Prerequisites: One of the following: English 603A, Rhetoric and Writing 306, 306Q, or Tutorial Course 603A.
Description:
This course is intended to provide an overview of British literature from the Anglo-Saxons to the present. In our study, we will
address issues of personal and social responsibility by asking what these works communicate about the values and choices of
different people and groups living in different social and historical contexts. We will also focus on close readings and analyses
of literary works to develop critical thinking skills. Moreover, we will reflect upon our own experience as readers and the
ways in which these texts, both historical and contemporary, challenge and relate to us today. Authors covered (in our
Summer 2020 course) include William Shakespeare, Aphra Behn, Oscar Wilde, and Virginia Woolf. English 316L may be used
to fulfill the humanities component of the university core curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives
established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking skills, personal
responsibility, and social responsibility.
Course Goals: By the end of the semester, you are expected to accomplish the following:
      • Read a diverse range of texts that portray key cultural elements of the periods studied.
      • Identify the historical discussions and debates that these texts both reflect and supplement.
      • Analyze the formal elements of these texts (figural language, style, genre, etc.) based upon literary methodologies.
      • Relate the various aspects of these texts to each other in order to comprehend their lasting influence.
      • Discuss the importance of these texts for values and choices in our contemporary moment.
      • Write an analytical essay utilizing standard writing practices including drafting, peer response, and revision
           strategies.
Course Flags:
      • This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your familiarity with
           cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come
           from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
      • This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with writing in an
           academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing
           projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the
           opportunity to revise assignments, and to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a
           substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work.
Required Texts/Materials: William Shakespeare, The Tempest; (including film version) Aphra Behn, Oroonoko, Oscar Wilde,
The Importance of Being Earnest (including film version); Virginia Woolf, A Room of One’s Own. All readings, films, lectures, and
videos will be available electronically.
Requirements & Grading:
      • Canvas Discussion:                                                                15%
      • Quizzes (including a “take-home” essay portion):                                  40%
      • CRIT exercise and workshop (scheduled meeting with TA):                           10%
      • Writing Workshop (rough draft, peer response workshop, and reflection):           15%
      • Final Essay:                                                                      20%
Grading scale is below:
A = 94-100 / A- = 90-93 / B+ = 87-89 / B = 84-86 / B- = 80-83 / C+ = 77-79 / C = 74-76 / C- = 70-73 / D+ = 67-69 / D = 64-66 /
D-= 60-63 / F= 59 and below.
To ensure fairness, only final averages 0.5 and above will be rounded up. Thus a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 79.5
through 83.4. The University does not recognize the grade of A+.


Course Policies:
Virtual Classroom Behavior Expectations
     • We will observe civil behavior at all times. Please work with me, with your TA, and with your classmates to create a
          safe, open, and useful environment for our conversations and work. If at any time this becomes an issue, I will
          communicate with you immediately and reserve the right to block you temporarily from Canvas access until the
          situation is resolved.
     • All course communication will be through Canvas. Please use Canvas communication tools only for class-related
          conversations.
     • Please communicate any questions or concerns with me through email (addressing me as Prof. García or Dr. García),
          or through my Zoom office hours.
     • I have 24 hours to respond to your email. Likewise, you have 24 hours to respond to my emails and communications
          as well. I will answer weekend emails on Sunday afternoons. In case of any emergencies, please send an email to me
          and to your TA as soon as possible and we will work to respond accordingly.
     • You will be assigned a TA. This TA will be your primary point of contact, will give feedback and assign grades, and will
          work with you on your writing assignments.
               o Your TA will contact you with section policy sheet, including contact information.
Honor Code: The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty,
trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Statement on Sensitive Content: The readings and discussions in this course may include sensitive or difficult content including
depictions of violence, sex/sexuality, race/racism, sexual/physical/emotional assault or abuse, and politics/political controversies.
Please note that all texts, projects, lectures, and discussions are designed to fulfill our course objectives and are thus required unless
the student and professor make alternative arrangements. I will strive to create a safe and productive classroom in which we can
discuss these topics, and I ask that all students help contribute to this environment. Please speak to me or to your TA if you have any
concerns or questions.
Academic Integrity: Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. Any
academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to University policy, including assessment of the stiffest penalty that the
instructor may assess (e.g., a failing grade in the course). The University may impose additional sanctions. Cheating in any
form, including plagiarism and self-plagiarism, will not be tolerated. If you are unclear about what constitutes plagiarism, ask
the instructor. For additional information on Academic Integrity, see http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint.php.
Personal Responsibility Statement: Each student will be responsible for the grades that he or she earns in this course. Except
under exceptional, documented conditions, no requests for grade modification (including those for a grade of “Incomplete”)
for personal circumstances outside the purview of the course (e.g., probationary standing, financial aid eligibility, scholarship
status, etc.) will be considered. Please monitor your grades carefully throughout the semester. Extra credit opportunities may
be offered to the class during the semester, but no individual extra credit opportunities will be allowed.
Quiz Policy : Quizzes will be posted by 9AM on Friday morning and due by the end of the day on Sundays (11:59 PM). Except
in the case of true emergencies or University cancellation of classes, no early or make-up quizzes will be allowed. Requests for
alternative quiz dates must be provided in writing to both the course instructor and TA at least 2 days before the scheduled
quiz date. All requests must be accompanied by supporting documentation.
Documented Disability Statement: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. Students with disabilities who require special accommodations need
to get a letter that documents the disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of the Dean of
Students (471-6259 or 471-4641 (TTY) for users who are hearing-impaired). This letter should be presented to the instructor
in each course at the beginning of the semester and accommodations needed should be discussed at that time. Five (5)
business days before an exam the student should remind the instructor of any testing accommodations that will be needed.
See the following website for more information: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd/providing.php.
     • Please speak directly to Dr. García about SSD accommodations. This should be done as soon as possible so we can
          make arrangements before our first assignments are due.
     • Please note that accommodations for quizzes will be made through Canvas. Your TA will be in touch with you
          regarding these arrangements.
     • Any accommodations regarding extensions on due dates will also be coordinated by your TA.


Religious Holy Days: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me and your TA of your pending absence at least fourteen days
prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a
project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time after the absence.
Consultation: I encourage everyone to use office hours, both for me and for your section TA. If you have an issue related to
grades, please see your TA first before meeting with me. I am also available by appointment. Writing advice is available from
the Undergraduate Writing Center at the UT Learning Commons at the PCL. Their website is http://uwc.utexas.edu/.
Grade Inquiries: Teaching assistants will be evaluating all course assignments, using a rubric designed by the professor. The
TAs and I meet to discuss each assignment’s guidelines, and we are in communication during the grading process, making any
adjustments as necessary. I have confidence in their ability to respond and evaluate to your work fairly and honestly. If,
however, you receive a grade that concerns you and would like to inquire about it, here are the guidelines:
     • Please wait 24 hours before contacting your TA via email to set up a meeting to discuss the grade. This will give you
         time to reflect upon your work and how it was evaluated.
     • Once that meeting is scheduled (preferable during the TA’s office hours), you should submit (via email) a written
         memo with your questions and concerns before the meeting so the TA has time to review this.
     • The TA will read over the memo beforehand, and during the meeting will discuss with you any questions or ask for
         clarifications. However, the TA will not consider or determine any grade changes at this meeting. The TA will consult
         with me, but the TA will make the final determination about grades. The TA has up to a week from the meeting to
         inform the student of the decision, and will do so with an email copied to the student and to the professor.
     • Any time before, during, or after this process, the professor reserves the right to intervene if necessary.
     • An exception: if the TA graded the assignment incorrectly (i.e. marked a right answer wrong, added points
         incorrectly) or did not record the grade correctly, please inform the TA via email immediately. You do not need to
         write a memo for this, but be specific in alerting the TA as to the error.
     • All grade concerns must be addressed within 1 week after the assignment is returned.
Canvas: This course uses Canvas, a Web-based course management system in which a password-protected site is created for
each course. You will be responsible for checking the course site regularly for class work and announcements; email may also
be used for announcements. You will also turn in written assignments directly to the site. Finally, all email correspondence
through our course site should be related to our course rather than personal information. To access Canvas, go to
http://canvas.utexas.edu/.
Campus Carry Information: Please see the university’s Campus Carry information page (http://campuscarry.utexas.edu) for
information regarding Campus Carry. I prohibit the concealed carry of handguns in my office and will be announcing this
policy orally in class as per the university guidelines.
Syllabus: The instructor retains the right to vary the syllabus and schedule for the course.
