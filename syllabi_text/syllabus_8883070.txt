Ethnicity & Gender: La Chicana
Instructor            Course Overview
Lexi Pérez Allison    The term “Chicana” has its roots in the 1960’s-70’s Civil Rights Era and the Chicano
                      Movement. Beginning in this rich activist heritage and ending in our current political
                      moment, in this class we will deconstruct the term “Chicana,” discovering and

                      celebrating the plurality of meanings and identities that make up the word. We will
lexi.perez@utexas.edu do this work through a survey of multiple genres—poetry, essay, testimonio, and
                      more—and we will have the opportunity to see how Chicanas have interrogated and
                      manipulated different forms in order to best express their hybridized selves.

 Essays (35%): Each student will write two critical essays that respond to any of the course readings completed up
 to that point. We will workshop essay drafts in class, and each student will have an individual conference with me

 hard copy have been received.

 Midterm (15%): Each student will take a midterm in class on the date recorded in the schedule. This midterm
 will be conducted via Canvas, and students will need to bring an electronic device to complete the exam. The
 exam will be comprised of key terms, short answer, and a short essay response to one of three given prompts.
 Final (30%): Each student will take a final exam via Canvas, to be completed on their own time and submitted on
 the date recorded in the schedule. The final will be comprised of three short essay responses to five given
 prompts. The student will have the option to choose which prompts they answer.
 Minor Assignments
 Participation (10%): Each student will receive a participation grade based on a variety of factors. These include
 speaking in class, performing small group activities in class, pop quizzes, and attendance. I understand that
 speaking in class might be difficult for some, and participation should consider more than just class discussion.
 Therefore, emailing me with specific questions or comments about the day’s lecture and visiting me in office
 hours will also count toward participation.
 Reading Responses (10%): Each student will need to complete 10 reading responses over the course of the
 semester. These write-ups need to be 1-2 pages long, double-spaced. Students can choose whichever texts they
 prefer to write about. Reading responses will be turned in as a hard copy at the beginning or end of class. These
 writings should be thoughtful considerations, critiques, or reflections surrounding the text. These are not
 summaries, and failing to follow these instructions will affect the grade received.
 Class Policies
 Accessibility: Your success in this class is important to me. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you
 from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet
 both your needs and course requirements. Any student with a documented disability who requires academic
 accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-
 3986 (video phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations. More
 information is available on the Services for Students with Disabilities website at
 http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd
 Behavior: Be respectful of your colleagues. There is zero tolerance for slurs or derogatory language. In general,
 don’t discriminate based on race, gender presentation, marital status, religion, disability, age, or sexual
 orientation. Everyone in our class has the right to be addressed in accordance with their personal identity.
 Everyone has the right to be addressed and treated in way that respects her/his self as an individual. Please let me
 know what I can do to make sure you feel respected in my classroom environment and able to engage with the
 material and with others. If you find a reading or assignment triggering in any way, or suspect that you will be
 triggered, please contact me as soon as possible. I am happy to speak with you about the content of the material in
 advance and/or provide you with an alternative assignment. If you are troubled by or feel unsafe in any class
 discussion, please speak with me as soon as possible so that we can work to resolve the immediate problem and
 prevent future issues.
 Discussion: It is never okay to laugh at, belittle, or harass a colleague because of their opinion or point of view.
 Always think about how your comments will support our learning as a group. But safe doesn’t mean operating in
Fall 2018                                                                                                         Page 4


 an environment where beliefs and ideas go unchallenged. Challenging colleagues to explain their arguments in a
 thoughtful manner is key to creating an engaging learning community.
 •        Make a commitment to understand unfamiliar positions from the context or point of view of your peers.
 •        Speak for yourself rather than for a group (use your “I” statements).
 •        Be present – really listening to your colleagues will dramatically improve your in-class experience and
          prevent most understandings.
 •        Take risks in speaking honestly; this will help the learning of the group.
 Late Work: If you believe your assignment will not be submitted on time, please send me an email explaining
 your situation. Once an assignment is 24 hours late without notice, I will automatically begin deducting one half-
 letter grade per day until it is received.
 Attendance: Students are required to come to class. This is a class centered upon small group reading and
 discussion, and your presence is essential to the integrity of the course. Each student is allowed 5 absences (there
 is no designation between unexcused and excused absences). I will send an absence/failing report upon the 3rd
 absence. Once a student reaches 6 absences, they will not receive credit for the course.
 Tardiness: If you have a schedule conflict (class, appointment, emergency) that will prevent your arriving to
 class on time, please send me an email explaining your situation. Three extreme cases of tardiness (more than 15
 minutes) will equal one recorded absence. If you have a class before mine that is particularly far, please speak
 with me so I can be aware and we can come up with an arrangement.
 Technology: Although I strongly encourage taking handwritten notes and reading assigned articles in hard copy,
 laptops and tablets are allowed for the purposes of viewing course materials and for taking notes. Cell phones
 should be silenced and should not be used during class. If your use of technology becomes distracting to yourself
 or others, I will ask you to put it away. If the problem continues, I may count you absent for the class period.
 Email: Email is the best means of communication for me. While I generally check my email on a regular basis,
 my inbox can become quite full with this number of students. I can guarantee a reply within 24 hours, but if you
 are looking for an immediate response, it might be in your best interest to come to office hours.
 Office Hours: Please come to office hours! I consider it a joy to talk one-on-one with my students. Office hours
 are a great place to ask questions, receive guidance, workshop an essay, or discuss a grade. Furthermore, coming
 to office hours helps your participation grade. If my office hours conflict with your schedule, please email me to
 set up an appointment. Always feel free to drop-in, but if you have an important matter to discuss, it might be best
 to email me beforehand. If my office hours become especially busy, I prioritize students with appointments.
 Food and Drink: I am more than fine with students bringing a drink or snack to class. Please do not let it become
 a distraction, and remember to throw away all trash before you leave the room.
 Finally—I truly am here to help each one of you learn and enjoy critical reading, writing, and the beauty and
 richness of Chicana literature and culture. My goal is for this course to be both a fun and rewarding experience.
 If you have any problems or concerns regarding this class, please do not hesitate to contact me or visit me in
 office hours. I am more than willing to help you out, and I look forward to getting to know each of you!
