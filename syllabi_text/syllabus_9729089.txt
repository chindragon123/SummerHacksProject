Course description:
This course examines women and gender in China from imperial times to the present. Major
themes include the changing conceptions of masculinity and femininity in Chinese cultural and
religious contexts; gender roles and inequalities in the patriarchal family and society; the varying
discourse on women and gender in the modern period; women’s dilemma in the Chinese
Revolution; new challenges to women and new conceptions of gender and sexuality during the
reform era since the 1980s. There is no prerequisite for attending this course, but some background
in Chinese history is recommended.
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your
familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at
least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
