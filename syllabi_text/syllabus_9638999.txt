COURSE OVERVIEW.
The intention of this class is to examine the evolution of storytelling experiences
beyond traditional film and television formats and delve into emerging
technologies and distribution platforms that are shaping today’s and tomorrow’s
entertainment content. In addition to lectures and in-class exploration of the
current and developing multi-platform interactive storytelling content, there will
be special guest speakers, industry professionals, who will share their career
achievements, challenges, and demonstrate advances in their area of the rapidly
evolving new media and gaming industry as well as field trips to see special
demonstrations of equipment and production.
Learning Objectives:
    1. Trace the evolution of new media multi-platform storytelling.
    2. Monitor emerging entertainment trends and technologies.
    3. Analyze an entertainment property to identify critical story elements.
    4. Identify all potential audiences for a story property.
    5. Identify optimal platforms for specific storytelling experience.
    6. Create unique storytelling experiences for these audiences.
    7. Create a multi-platform plan for a chosen entertainment property.
                                                                                               1


ASSIGNMENTS. Per the Canvas syllabus dates you can instantly access, you
will find written assignments are due to be posted onto Canvas no later than the
commencement of the next class session (e.g.: an assignment assigned on
Tuesday, it would be due the following Tuesday.) Please do not submit
printed material unless requested.
Post ALL written assignments (double-spaced) to Canvas. Include Your name
and Title of the Assignment (such as the Guest Speaker and the 5 questions
due). Extensions will be difficult to come by.          However, if extenuating
circumstances arise, like a death in the family or your own illness, please notify
me via text or email before the deadline so that we can discuss it.
SPECIAL GUEST SPEAKERS and FIELD TRIPS.                  Innovative and industry
pioneering professionals from the Entertainment and New Media will be
scheduled as available to show up to offer their insights and personal
experiences. Field Trips to production companies and new media studios will also
be scheduled to offer very special demonstrations of equipment and media
production that can only be experienced outside of the UTLA classroom.
Owing to unpredictable schedules, there may be last minute changes which will
be communicated to all students via the class Facebook page and email. You
will be expected to research the speakers, companies, and their work
ahead of time to ask them questions in class or on location IN
ADDITION to the assigned questions you will be posting on Canvas-
this is part of your grade. This is a unique opportunity for you to speak
directly with professionals working on state of the art projects. These
visits are highly valuable and you will be expected to participate in the
Q&A for each speaker.
ABSENCES /TARDY. See above in “Assignments.” Allow plenty of time for
your commute, (to the classroom as well as various field trip locations) as L.A.
traffic is both congested and unpredictable. If you have a legitimate scheduling
problem (this does NOT include business lunches, family visits and
screenings!) Please contact me prior to class via email, text, or a phone call to
the office (747-283-1756).
Every On-Time class attendance will fully count towards your semester
attendance grade, however each instance of being TARDY without any prior
approval will result on you only receiving 80% of that evening’s class attendance
credit and an ABSENCE will result in 0% credit for that evening’s class
attendance credit unless discussed with me prior to the class date. Early exits
will have the same effect as a TARDY.
                                                                                  2


INTERNSHIPS VS YOUR CLASS SESSIONS: At NO time may your
internship be used as an excuse for being late or missing class. Your
internship host should accommodate your need to fulfill your punctual
classroom attendance. It is your responsibility to communicate your
schedule ahead of time with your host to make this happen.
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for fulfilling the requirements of this class and
will receive the grade you earn only by doing so.

The University of Texas Honor Code: The core values of The University of
Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to
uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
toward peers and community.
Scholastic Dishonesty: The University defines academic dishonesty as
cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, falsifying academic records, and
any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process.
Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or
misleading information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test,
quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same written
assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By
accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to
them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student’s learning experience and
readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who violate
University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. For more information on scholastic dishonesty, please visit the
Student Judicial services website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs.
Religious Holidays: Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and
examination schedules. If you miss an assignment or other project due to the
observance of a religious holy day you will be given an opportunity to complete
the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. It is the policy of
the University of Texas at Austin that you must notify your instructor at least
fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to
observe a religious holy day.
