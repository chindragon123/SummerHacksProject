Course Description
          In today’s world, a functional knowledge of Islam– in terms of religion, history, and culture – is
crucial. Muslims comprise approximately ¼ of the world’s population, with an estimated global
population of 1.9 billion. Islam is the majority religion of 51 countries in the world; in 33 of these
countries, Muslims make up 90% or more of the population. And while many people associate Middle
Eastern languages such as Arabic, Persian, and Turkish with Islam, millions of Muslims also speak a
range of other languages as their native tongues: Urdu-Hindi, Bengali, Indonesian/Malay, Pashto, Hausa,
French, and many others. Over the course of its long history and geographical spread, Islam has branched
into a spectrum of theological sects, schools of law, mystical orders, and ideological movements. At the
same time, Muslims are bound together by a shared tradition anchored in the scripture of the Qur’an, the
exemplary practice of the Prophet Muhammad, and a 1400-year-old historical experience.
          This lower-division course aims to give students a foundational understanding of Islam as a
religion, with attention to beliefs (cosmology, theology, mysticism), practices (ritual, rites of passage), and
morality (ethics, moral doctrines). It also introduces students to key moments in Islamic history as well as
key aspects of Muslim societies and cultures, both past and present. Finally, this course will develop skills in
news analysis and content knowledge is current affairs pertaining to Muslims. This course is designed for
students with no prior knowledge of Islam and has no prerequisites.
