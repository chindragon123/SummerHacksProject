Course Description
LAR 388L is a lecture course that continues History and Theories of Landscape Architecture I
(Antiquity to 1750), but it also functions perfectly as a stand-alone course. It covers the formal
and cultural history of gardens, parks and public landscapes from 1750 to the 2000s. The course
thus ranges from the theories and practices of the Picturesque in 18th-century English landscape
gardens to contemporary urban parks, worldwide. The focus is on understanding the critical
components of design language, as well as contemporary discourses on landscape architecture. It
seeks to identify and discuss the theoretical frameworks that structured and enriched the
imaginations of the designers and their publics, the observers and users of the landscapes. We
situate the formation of theories and conceptualizations of modern designed landscapes in
specific historical contexts. The multivalent forms of modern and contemporary landscape
architecture, which cross borders with art, architecture and urban planning, technology,
philosophy and geography, amongst others, are examined in the contexts of public and private
spheres, relations between city and countryside, the rise of technology, social reform and
ecological concerns during industrialization, urbanization, and modernization. Attention is given,
in each historical period, to landscape representation and the development of publishing and
visual strategies to diffuse knowledge and perception by the public of landscape architectural
work.
The course charts in particular the rise of public landscapes--from the early 19th-century
landscaped, "picturesque" parks of England and Germany to the public park movement in
America, to contemporary developments--today. Attention will be given to the evolution of
modernism in landscape architecture, its origins in Europe and America from the 1910s to its later
expression in the 1960s and 1970s. Lectures will analyze the typologies of designed landscapes
and the notion of the profession of landscape architecture from "Capability Brown," Humphry
Repton, Karl-Friedrich Schinkel, Frederick Law Olmsted Sr., to Gertrude Jekyll, Beatrix Farrand,


Prof. Mirka Beneš          UT School of Architecture: LAR 388 L           Spring 2020         p. 2
and on to Leberecht Migge, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, Thomas Church, Garrett Eckbo,
Dan Kiley, Lawrence Halprin, Dieter Kienast, Günter Vogt, among others. Comparisons will also
be made with contemporary designers, for example, Martha Schwartz, Kongjian Yu, George
Hargreaves, Michael Van Valkenburgh, and Kate Orff. The historical material that we cover
helps us to interpret the work of contemporary designers from the period called "Post-
Modernism" to recent times.
Throughout the course, we will consider the new thinking about landscape and landscape
architecture that has occurred in professional and academic circles particularly during the last
several decades, a period characterized by interdisciplinary thinking in both professional practice
and academic research--in which contemporary landscape architects play an increasingly
important role. Landscape, by definition, refers always to other categories in addition to itself,
and the interdisciplinary nature of modern and contemporary landscape design will be analyzed
through critical reference to methodologies used in fields akin to the history and criticism of
landscape design, such as geography, social and urban history, art and architectural history;
histories of science, technology, and botany; and studies of landowning, planning, and
stewardship. As the history and criticism of contemporary landscape architecture are always
emerging fields, as new design work is produced, the last part of the course has an exploratory
methodological cast and seeks to define the methodologies and historical periodization
appropriate to the specific content of the developing contemporary fields.
Goals and Objectives of the Course:
On a broad level, the course encourages the student to situate designed sites and their
conceptualization in historical or modern contexts; to recognize their multivalent character and
the fundamental social and interdisciplinary nature of their production, which engages
variously with the spheres of art, architecture, urbanism and planning, ecological and
geographical systems, among others. On a theoretical and methodological level, the course
readings encourage an evaluation of the new thinking about landscape and landscape architecture
that has occurred in professional and academic circles particularly during the last several decades,
a period characterized by interdisciplinary thinking in both professional practice and academic
research, which brings together landscape architecture and other disciplines--geography, history,
sociology, art, architecture, and science.
Above all, the course seeks to train students in understanding the designed works of modern and
contemporary landscape architecture as design in social context. Through the study of history
and theories, the course structures the range of conceptual categories and contexts, which are
specific to the designing of works of landscape architecture. The key underlying question is: how
does one conceptualize the design of a work of landscape architecture? what are the relevant
issues and contexts at hand? Four frameworks are engaged to structure the course material:
         1. Historical and Theoretical Frameworks: Categories of Reference.
         2. The Formation of Landscape Architecture as a Discipline and as a Profession.
         3. The Inscription of Meanings in Landscape Architecture: Theoretical-Cultural
                  Interpretation.
         4. The Relevance of History for the Contemporary Field of Design.
Lectures, Discussion, and Discussion Sections:
Handouts:         Handouts with sites and dates will be distributed to accompany lectures.
Discussions:      Discussion takes place in the classroom, and students are encouraged to ask
                  questions. Some sessions are devoted to reviewing previously seen material.


Prof. Mirka Beneš           UT School of Architecture: LAR 388 L                                       Spring 2020                   p. 3
Sections:         Discussion Sections (one meeting of 45 min about every other week, or as
                  needed, for discussion-preparation of assignments and exam, and to go over
                  lecture material) will be scheduled for undergraduate students. The T.A. will
                  organize these sections. Graduate students should signal to the T.A. if they wish
                  to attend sections.
Field Trips:      Depending on class size, one or more lectures (field trips on campus) will have a
                  seminar format making use of the university's rich resources in rare book rooms,
                  museums, and archives, among them the Harry Ransom Center (rare books and
                  maps). Such field trips vary from year to year.
Class attendance is mandatory, and forms part of your grade for this course.
It is mandatory, unless exemption has been given in advance by the instructor for excusable
absences. Studio travel or trips are excusable, but you must contact the T.A. in advance. Students
with three (3) or more unexcused absences are subject to lowering of the final grade for the
course: for example, if your final grade is a B, you will receive a B- for more than three absences,
followed by a C+ if you accrue an additional three unexcused absences, etc. Please contact the
T.A. or the instructor by email in advance, if you expect to be absent. Attendance will be
taken in class.
Time Commitment of Students:
Includes class time (lectures and discussions), plus about four (4) hours (varies) of weekly
reading. Additional time for study, reading and preparation for projects. The course assignments
are spaced across the semester, and the instructor attempts to accomodate deadlines for the class
in view of specific studio deadlines that students may have.

Grading Policy and Grade Descriptions:
Grades given will include A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, and F. Grading will follow
these principles:
A = excellent work that displays conceptual rigor, original research, and insights and ideas that
                        tend to go beyond those presented by the readings or by the instructor in
                        class; excellent writing and superb presentation of the project in terms of
                        Bibliography, Notes, Images. The assignment or essay has a rigorously
                        supported argument. Readings are strongly engaged in the assignment,
                        and the student takes a position with respect to them, successfully
                        critiquing or building on them.
B = good work that displays thorough understanding of the material and successful completion of
                        the assignment, very good writing, diligent research, fine presentation of
                        the project in terms of Bibliography, Notes, Images. The assignment or
                        essay has an argument that is clear to the reader. Readings are very well
                        engaged in the assignment.
C = satisfactory work that meets the minimum requirements of the assignment, displays no
                        further pursuit of ideas presented in class and in readings, displays
                        limitations in skills, writing, conceptualization, and presentation of


Prof. Mirka Beneš           UT School of Architecture: LAR 388 L            Spring 2020        p. 5
                           project. The argument of the essay or assignment is not clearly presented.
                           Readings are minimally brought into the assignment.
D = poor work that does not meet the minimum requirements of the assignment and does not
                           meet the level of skills required to complete the assignment in terms of
                           conceptualization, writing, and presentation. No attempt to structure an
                           argument is made. Readings are not well understood and are not even
                           minimally brought into the assignment.
F = unacceptable, failing work that includes incomplete assignment or major parts of it,
                           unacceptable delays in turning in the work, unsuccessful performance
                           overall.

Academic Accomodations:
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations
for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, please contact the Office of the
Dean of Students, the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students
with Disabilities as soon as possible, at (512) 471-6259 or (512) 471-6441 TTY, also to request
an official letter outlining authorized accommodations. The website is at:
http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability
Readings:
Readings consist of Required Readings (in Syllabus) and Recommended Readings (a separate
document on CANVAS).
1. Required Readings are located under MODULES on CANVAS at http://canvas.utexas.edu.
The course readings have been very carefully chosen and balanced with each other, in order to
provide the greatest range of historical, aesthetic, design, philosophical, geographical approaches
that regard the periods studied. Most of the readings have become "classics" in the literature.
          Students may wish to supplement readings with a textbook, and one of the following two
          is highly recommended, but especially the Girot 2016:
          Recommendation of an excellent overall history, written by a contemporary
          landscape architect:
          Girot, Christophe. The Course of Landscape Architecture: A History of our Designs
                   on the Natural World, from Prehistory to the Present (London: Thames and
                   Hudson, 2016).


Prof. Mirka Beneš           UT School of Architecture: LAR 388 L           Spring 2020         p. 7
          Also highly recommended:
          Rogers, Elizabeth Barlow. Landscape Design: A Cultural and Architectural History
                   (New York, 2001). [in paperback]
          Students are responsible for information and concepts in the Required Readings, which
          are posted on CANVAS under MODULES. Required readings are to be used in
          assignments.
          The instructor appreciates the fact that, given many students' commitment to design
          studio time, not all Required Readings can be done immediately, at the time of the
          lectures. Therefore, on this Syllabus, the priority readings are highlighted in bold; the
          other Required Readings can be read as soon as time permits, but should be read within a
          week's delay and before exam and assignment due dates.
2. Recommended Readings: these are your bibliographies for your Assignments!!!:
          The Recommended Readings form a very important part of this course. They are very
          extensive for each lecture's topic, and they provide a wide range of readings for research
          on your assignments and for future use in your professional lives. Explore them! The
          Recommended Readings list is posted on CANVAS.
Appendix of Suggested Readings:
At the end of this Syllabus is an APPENDIX ON REFERENCE MATERIALS & TEXTBOOKS,
as well as Suggestions for Readings on Theoretical and Methodological Issues. Be sure to look at
it! It can be very useful for future research in your careers.
