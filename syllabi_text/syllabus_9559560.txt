Course objectives: The purpose of this course is to give you a solid foundation in theories
of learning and motivation that inform learning and teaching strategies. When you have
completed the course, you should be able to:
     1.  discuss and apply the various theoretical perspectives
     2.  recognize examples of the theory in everyday instructional practice
     3.  relate them to yourself as a learner through examples and scenarios
     4.  relate them to your future professional work even if it’s not in education
The semester will be cover three units devoted to the following topics:
        Unit 1 – cognition and memory, teaching concepts and information
        Unit 2 - socially-based learning, development, and self-regulation skills
        Unit 3 - motivation and behavior management
Each unit will be evaluated by reading assessments, daily activities, applications, and an
exam. You will work individually and in groups throughout the semester.
NOTE: This syllabus is subject to change.
Website and Communication: This course has a Canvas site associated with it.
http://canvas.utexas.edu/
You are responsible for keeping up with information and communication via Canvas.
Canvas will be used to post announcements, files, assignments, supplementary materials,
and lecture slides. Canvas allows me to email the whole class and to have announcements
and assignment reminders posted to your page, so be on the lookout for messages from us
on occasion. Please check which email address is being used by the University for you. If
you have problems with computer access, please let me know so I can make other

figuring out what to read each week based on my reading list calendar (below).

                                  ELEMENTS OF THE COURSE
Overview of course activities: This class heavily relies on collaborative group learning.
As such, you will be assigned to small groups by the second week of the semester. Most
class days will involve you working in your group to do in-class activities that will expand
on the basics from the readings and prepare you for the exams. It is expected that readings
will be completed before class for the topic scheduled. For each topic, Tuesdays will often
start by asking students to check their understanding of the reading (reading assessments)
and apply the assigned readings (in-class activities). The remaining part of Tuesday and all
of Thursday will be spent discussing and applying content as a group with an interactive
lecture on the material of focus. Some class periods will be devoted to more in-depth
application of theories using design scenarios.
Evaluation procedures: You can demonstrate your efforts and learning in the class and earn
credits toward your final grade on a variety of assignments.
Reading assessments will be held in class (24 points - see course schedule). These will be
at the beginning of class so please arrive promptly. Once you begin an online “reading
assessment” you have 10 minutes to complete it. Each reading assessment is worth 3
points. You have 10 opportunities throughout the semester. I will keep your eight best
scores (drop your lowest two scores). You will debrief with your group directly following
each reading assessment so arrive on time.
    Why study for “reading assessments”?
        1. You will come to class better aware of what you do or don’t understand and can
        be ready to ask questions.
        2. You will become an active participant in your learning rather than a passive
        vessel waiting to be filled.

        3. You will be ready to do extension activities in class, and so will learn more and
        better remember the applications.
In-class (and perhaps a few out-of-class) activities help by thinking about, comparing,
and analyzing examples. Active practice is an excellent way to learn new material. To help
you do this, I will have small in-class groups in which you can work cooperatively to
generate examples and applications of the material to submit for credit. There will be at
least 13 in-class (and/or a few out-of-class) activity opportunities. Each set of activities is
worth 3 points. I will keep your highest 12 scores for a total of 36 points.
 Because there are plenty of opportunities to complete the reading assessments and in-
           class activities, there will be no make-up quizzes or in-class activities.
Application assignments, 3 opportunities, but only complete one, worth 24 points or 8% of
your overall course grade. These will be individual, out-of-class assignments (due Feb. 28,
April 11, and May 2). Examples of the types of assignments you will receive include
analyzing a classroom scenario, analyzing yourself as a learner, or designing a learning
opportunity that illustrates a unit’s topic.
Group design a class, 3 total, worth 23 points each (69 points total) and altogether, 23% of
your overall course grade. These are group assignments, one per unit (Feb. 19, March 26,
April 30), that require application of that unit’s material. Points are available only to people
in attendance on the application day. If you are absent on one of these days, please let me
know you will be absent as soon as possible. If you have a University excused absence, you
will do the assignment by yourself to get credit. Specific instructions for the activity will be
given in class the day before the activity day so that students may prepare individually
before working together.
Unit exams, 3 total (Feb. 21, March 28, May 9), worth 45 points each (135 points total) and
altogether, 45% of your grade. Exams will consist of a mix of applied multiple-choice items
and short answer items. There are only make-up exams for University excused absences
and the format of the make-up exam will be different than the in-class unit exam. You must
let me know as soon as possible if you will miss an exam (please send an email and discuss
it with me).

  Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
  evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement

        Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
        building.
   • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing
        during the first week of class.
   • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do
        not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
        Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention
