Introduction to Expressive Culture
The purpose of this course is to introduce the concept of culture as a crucial dimension of human
life. Because we tend to think of thought and action as stemming from individual impulses, we
find the notion of a shared, highly variable, but influential force in our lives hard to fathom.
Even if we speak of "society" as a familiar concept, we tend to make of it a uniform, oppressive
force, some institution outside ourselves that we individually confront and oppose. Yet only if
we can learn to recognize how deeply we share certain assumptions and inclinations with others-
-but only some others, and to varying degrees--can we appreciate the degree to which culture
inheres within us and makes us who we are.
The course begins by considering the many inferences we draw, often unconsciously, when we
look at people’s faces and when we listen to them speak, that is, what implicit meanings we find
in someone’s appearance and accent. Implicit meanings become particularly noteworthy in
expressive genres, such as folklore and mass media. So we will turn our attention to the kinds of
meanings, implicit and explicit, that analysts have found (or argued about) in fairy tales. We will
then consider how similar kinds of analyses might be made of a number of films, including
American, English, and Asian ones: how they, too, constitute something like fairy tales.
An introductory course cannot cover any single topic in great depth. My intention is to
compensate for that fact by pointing to some of the many intriguing and timely issues that the
subject of expressive culture opens up. My hope is that this survey will entice students into
looking into these issues in greater depth in later coursework. More importantly, I hope that the
course will enable students to analyze their own experience in cultural, rather than purely
individual, psychological terms.
My office hours this semester are on Tuesday afternoons from 2:00 till 4:00. However, I realize
that students may not be able to come to my office at this time. Please feel free to email me to
arrange to meet me at another time. You do not have to have a formal agenda to justify a visit to
my office. I am happy to speak with students on matters of general interest. If you come to my
office during office hours or when we have set up an appointment but find that I am speaking
with someone else, please let me know that you are waiting.
Reading and viewing assignments:
Readings will be available as pdf files on the Canvas site for the course. The book, Sleuthing the
Alamo, by James Crisp, is available in new and used copies at the University Co-op Bookstore.
All reading is required. Copies will also be available at the PCL Reserves desk.


The course includes a number of films that will be shown on Monday evenings 6 p.m. If you do
not attend either of the screenings of a film arranged for the class, you are obliged to arrange to
see it on your own time.
Grading and exams: There will be two mid-term exams and a final essay. Each of the exams will
be worth twenty-two points; the final essay will be worth twenty-four. The rest of a student’s
grade (32%) will be based on ten (out of a possible twelve) weekly comments students write on
the reading and/or viewing (each worth two points), and attendance and participation in section
discussion (worth a total of twelve points). Each comment must be submitted through Canvas
before your section meets. No credit will be given if you fail to attend class: simply submitting
your comment does not suffice. No comments will be required during the first week, or the final
week of the semester. Assignments cannot be made up. No options for getting extra credit are
available in this course.
Classes will consist of both lecture and discussion. Students are expected to attend class and to
be prepared to enter into discussion. Students are also expected to come to class punctually and
remain throughout class. Consistent tardiness or frequent absence must be explained.
Please do not use laptop computers or cell phones during class.
Lectures Online
I have agreed to have the course linked to the Lectures Online recording system. This
system records the audio and video material presented in class for you to review after
class. Links for the recordings will appear in the Lectures Online tab on the Canvas page
for this class.
To watch a recording, simply click on the Lectures Online navigation tab and follow the
instructions presented to you on the page. You can learn more about how to use the
Lectures Online system at http://sites.la.utexas.edu/lecturesonline/.
Recordings are presented free of charge through the 12th class day. After the 12th class
day you will need to pay a one-time course materials charge to gain access to all
recordings for the class.
Students with disabilities
Students with disabilities are welcome to take this course. Accommodation will be made
for such students in accordance with whatever arrangements a student makes with the
Office for Students with Disabilities. Please provide your TA and me with documentation
of those arrangements as soon as possible. Please do not wait until immediately before
a mid-term to speak with us about this matter.
Students under stress
                                              2


Undergraduates are entering upon a particularly exciting and stressful period in their lives. Many
feel overwhelmed at times and they may not have systems of support established yet to help
them deal with the challenges that necessarily arise. It is therefore important to know that
counseling services are available at UT. I have myself benefited greatly from various forms of
psychotherapy over the years and would urge students to take advantage of the help they can get
from trained counselors on campus. Here’s where to find out more: https://cmhc.utexas.edu/
Gender and sexuality are particularly likely to generate questions and anxiety. Here is a resource
for all students who want help thinking through these matters:

Policy  on  Academic  Integrity  
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and / or dismissal from the University. Since such
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on academic
dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, please visit the Student Conduct and
Academic Integrity website at: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct.
Schedule
Week 1            January 21 - 25               Introduction: What do we infer from looking at
                                                people’s faces?
Reading:
You are required to look at the following web pages:
http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/group/LangloisLAB/facialattract.html
When you open this page, you will find on the left-hand side a list of three articles under the
label “Face Perception.” Read the following two:
http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/group/LangloisLAB/averagenessbeauty.html
http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/group/LangloisLAB/preferences.html
If you are intrigued and want to know more about Dr. Langlois’s research, you are encouraged to
read the first one on the list as well, entitled “Maxims and Myths of Facial Beauty.” Here is the
link:
Langlois, J. H., Kalakanis, L., Rubenstein, A. J., Larson, A., Hallam, M., & Smoot, M. (2000).
Maxims or myths of beauty? A meta-analytic and theoretical review. Psychological Bulletin,
126, 390-423. PDF Version (2.2 MB) © American Psychological Association.
Although much of the article is technical, reading p. 390 to the top of p. 395, and pp. 404-408
will give you the gist of the study and results. This reading is optional but worthwhile.
Note that sections will meet on Friday, January 24, as usual.
