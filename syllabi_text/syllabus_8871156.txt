Course (Game) Description
This course is designed to introduce students to the design and aesthetics of games. Our
discussions, assignments, and other course activities follow two main threads: (1) how are
games designed, and (2) what are the aesthetics of play and games. Student activities
include playing and analyzing games, reading articles on game aesthetics and design, and
creating a tabletop game to further deepen understanding.

Professsionalism
Attendance, completed assigned readings, participation in class discussions and activities,
performing special assignments, and being actively involved in supporting the work of the
classmates are part of this requirement. You must come ready to discuss each reading in
class, and be prepared to ask critical-thinking questions about the readings, and engage in
discourse on questions your fellow students may have. How your teammates view the
quality and quantity of your work, as well as your team skills are important.
