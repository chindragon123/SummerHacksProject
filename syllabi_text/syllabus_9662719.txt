                                                                          the unique opportunity to analyze
real-world data in a lab setting for 1.5 hour of class time each week. The weekly 1.5-hour lab sessions
meet in FAC 101B. Attendance is mandatory and you are expected to arrive on time. All lab work is done
in pairs. Students that are not in class by the time work has begun (usually within 5 minutes of the start
of class) will not be allowed to work with a partner and will be docked 5 points from their lab grade for
their first late lab, 10 points from the second, etc. If your lab partner doesn’t arrive on time, you may
choose to work with another individual or work alone.


                     WHAT ARE THE COURSE REQUIREMENTS?
LECTURE ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION
There are 25 points assigned for lecture attendance and participation. You must be present and
participate (via Squarecap) in at least 80% of the lecture days to receive 25 points. If you participate in at
least 50% of classes (but less than 80%) you will get 10 points. Otherwise, you get 0 points. You will need
a working (and charged) cell phone, tablet, or laptop which can connect to the internet to participate
each day.
REQUIRED TEXTBOOK & MATERIALS

        it and bring it with you to class every day.


               WHAT KINDS OF ASSIGNMENTS WILL WE DO?
This course is divided into three-unit exams. Each unit ends with a lecture exam that will evaluate your
knowledge of the material. All other unit assignments are learning tools designed to help you develop
the necessary skills and understanding. Consistent performance on these assignments will help your
grade, but your performance on exams will be considered the strongest indicator of your success in
meeting the course learning outcomes.

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS
Labs (45 pts X 5). Labs consist of two assignments: pre-lab (worth 10 points) and lab (worth 35
points). Pre-lab is completed on-line and you can re-take it for a higher grade. Lab is completed
during your assigned lab time.
Homework Problems (100 pts). Homework problems cover data analysis problems from the topics
covered in lecture. Homework must be submitted via Canvas by the deadline. You must
photograph your handwritten work or type out your work. I suggest submitting using the Canvas
By Instructure App available on Google Play or the iTunes store. Keep up with problem
assignments due dates on Canvas.
3 Exams (450 pts). There will be two in-class exams and the third exam will be held during the final exam
session. These exams are a combination of multiple choice and hand problem-solving. You must show
your work for full credit. They will cover material discussed in class and lab.
Poster Project (200 pts total). The poster project will be presented during the assigned final examination
period (you must be present for your project to be graded). This project will allow you to select your
own research question of interest, collect your own data, and present your findings in a poster session.
There will be several important deadlines throughout the semester leading up to the final presentation
during your university assigned final exam time.


                HOW WILL I BE GRADED?
MISSED ASSIGNMENT POLICY We will offer make-up exams,
assignments, and labs only under the following circumstances. For
any other reason, a make-up is not guaranteed and a grade of “0”
will be recorded for any missed lab, assignment, or exam.
1. You are away from UT as part of a UT-sponsored activity including
athletics. Check with me if you are uncertain whether your absence
qualifies.
ASSIGNMENTS Points 2. The lecture, lab, or exam is in conflict
5 Labs              225      with a religious observance – notify me
Homework            100      by the 12th day of class.
3 Exams             450      3. You suffer from a chronic, documented illness or an emergency that
Final Project       200      results in your missing an exam or lab. Under these circumstances, contact
                             me as soon as possible to discuss a course of action.
Attendance          25
                                   If you miss an assignment for any other reason (ie. unexpected illness
Total               1000
                             not documented, car wreck) you have 24 hours to contact the TA and discuss
your course of action. If you fail to contact the TA within this time frame you will not be allowed to make
up missed assignments unless you have documentation indicating your inability to contact us. After your
first late assignment, you will receive a grade of 0 on any missed or late lab or assignment unless you
can provide documentation for one of the 3 reasons listed above. You must attend the final poster
session in order to have your final project graded. Failure to attend the poster session will result in a
grade of a zero for the final poster.
          If you experience a Canvas issue and cannot upload an assignment through the system before
the deadline, if you email the assignment to the instructor or TA prior to the deadline, the assignment
will not be considered late. Emailing to state you are experiencing a problem, without including the
assignment as an attachment will still count as a missed assignment.
BONUS POINTS Occasionally, there will be assignments during the semester
that I will offer as bonus points. These bonus points will be added to your           Course        Points

     summary of the concern. If you do not provide evidence of a specific                C           730
     error, your request for a regrade will not proceed.                                 C-          700
There will be a one-week window after you receive your grade for regrade                 D+          670
requests on any course assignment. Then, the grade sticks.
                                                                                         D           630

point cutoffs listed below. Please note that grade cutoffs are firm. We do not
curve grades in this class. Keep track of your progress so you know if you are meeting your grade goal.
Your total course grade will be reflected on the Canvas course site (not lab site). All grades will be copied
over from the lab site to the main course site. To see how many points you have earned in the class at
any point hover over your “Assignments” percentage.


                            WHAT ARE THE CLASS POLICIES?
STUDENT ACCOMMODATIONS Students with a documented disability may request appropriate
academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone).
http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
     • Please request a meeting as soon as possible to discuss any accommodations
     • Please notify me as soon as possible if the material being presented in class is not accessible
     • Please notify me if any of the physical space is difficult for you
 EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are
required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
requires exiting and assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and
building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when
entering the building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform me in writing during the
first week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. I
will notify you via Canvas for follow up directions regarding missed class time. Do not re-enter a building
unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin
Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office. More information can be found at:
www.utexas.edu/emergency
 IF YOU NEED HELP CMHC Crisis Line is a confidential service of CMHC that offers an opportunity for UT-
Austin students to talk with trained counselors about urgent concerns. A counselor is available every day
of the year, including holidays. You can call when you want, at your convenience. Telephone counselors
will spend time addressing your immediate concerns. CMHC 24/7 Crisis Line: 512-471-CALL (2255).
ACADEMIC HONESTY The course is built upon the idea that team-based learning is important and a
powerful way to learn. I encourage you to study together often. However, there are times when you
need to demonstrate your own ability to work and solve problems. Your projects and exams are
independent assignments. This means these assignments are to be completed on your own, without
discussion with your peers. You can work with other students to complete your homework, but you
cannot copy answers from someone else. Students who violate these expectations can expect to receive
a failing grade on the assignment and be reported to the Student Judicial Services for academic
dishonesty.
Additionally, you cannot share any assignment, handout, or document related to this class. Sharing any
class materials online in any form, including the homework and assignments you submitted, without my
express approval is considered academic dishonesty. If something is found online which you have
posted, you will be reported for academic dishonesty to SJS.
