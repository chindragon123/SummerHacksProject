Grading
3% Attendance/Participation
17% Homework + In-class evaluations
20% Midterm #1
20% Midterm #2
40% Final Exam (Cumulative, twice as long as a midterm exam)
Each in-class evaluation will count like an assignment. The lowest grade of the combination of


(Homework + In-class evaluations) will be dropped.
•   Midterm #1 (Friday, June 28, 2019). Exam will be held during lecture.
•   Midterm #2 (Friday, August 2, 2019). Exam will be held during lecture.
•   The final exam tentatively targeted for August 17, 2019 (Saturday) 9:00 AM -12:00 PM .
    Will be set with help from the Office of the Registrar. Location: TBD.
•
Also note:
• July 12: No class
• August 16 is last day of classes.
Lecture helps connect the pieces of the class together. Attendance in lecture is highly correlated
to your final grade and helpful in landing industry positions. Moreover, it allows you to get the
most for your tuition dollar. Plus and minus grades will be assigned for the final letter grades.
Grades on assignments will be posted on the course Canvas site.
Request for regrading an assignment must be made in writing within one (1) week of the graded
assignment being made available to students in the class.
Discussion of homework questions is encouraged, but…. Each of you needs to submit own
independent homework solution. Late assignments will be subject to a penalty of 2% for every
minute late.
University Honor Code
“The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.” http://www.utexas.edu/about-ut/mission-core-purpose-honor-code
Religious Holidays
By UT Austin policy, you must notify the instructor of any pending absence at least fourteen (14)
days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day, or on the first class day if the
observance takes place during the first fourteen days of the semester. If you must miss class, lab
section, exam, or assignment to observe a religious holiday, you will have an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable amount of time after the absence.
College of Engineering Drop/Add Policy
The Dean of Engineering must approve adding or dropping courses after the second class day of
the summer term.
Students with Disabilities
UT provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with
disabilities. Disabilities range from visual, hearing, and movement impairments to ADHD,
psychological disorders (e.g. depression and bipolar disorder), and chronic health conditions (e.g.
diabetes and cancer). These also include from temporary disabilities such as broken bones and
recovery from surgery. For more information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities at
