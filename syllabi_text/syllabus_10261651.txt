Books & Materials:
All course materials and instructions will be available online via Canvas--no additional purchases necessary, except possibly a Student subscription to Adobe CC.
(There are free and paid options; see details HERE.)
Course Description:
From presentations to content to case-study videos, today’s brand communicators must know how to create persuasive pieces, using a variety of digital software
tools. This course introduces all students to the fundamentals of good graphic design, as well as production basics. Students will then build their digital design
skills using industry-standard software, from print to motion and interactive. Assumes no prior knowledge.
Will this course turn you into a complete Photoshop ninja? Probably not in such a short time. However, if you want to create better content, up your 'Gram and
YouTube game, or just get over the mental block of starting to learn some invaluable and employable skills, you've come to the right place.

Course Outcomes:
By the end of this course, you should demonstrate an understanding of:
 1. Adobe CC Skills: Ability to use various Adobe professional-level applications to create brand messages.
 2. Craft: How well a message is conceptualized, designed, and constructed digitally.
 3. Visual Communication: Understanding how we communicate visually, in static, motion, and interactive media.
Coursework.
You'll be assigned various projects to learn the theoretical fundamentals as well as practical skills of designing and producing work using various Adobe CC
programs. Weekly Projects are graded on a simple 5-point scale. Some of these projects allow you freedom to demonstrate your growing skills, and can be graded
more subjectively than the tests. (In other words, your creative decisions play a bigger role in this grade, and sheer amount of work put into a project does not
always correlate with the final output. This is ultimately a design-oriented class, and there aren't always clear "right or wrong" answers--only better or weaker
design solutions.)
Grades.
Here’s how your final course grade will be calculated:
55% = 11 Projects (5% each)
45% = 3 Tests (15% each)
Final letter grades are calculated according to these cutoffs—no exceptions:
A = 94 to 100 A- = 90 to <94 B+ = 87 to <90 B = 87 to <84 B- = 84 to <80 C+ = 80 to <77 C = 77 to <74 C- = 74 to <70 D+ = 70 to <67 D = 67 to <64 D- = 64
to <61 F = 61 to 0
Policies:
Late Work
As a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry, you are expected to complete every project on time – no exceptions. All projects are due on Canvas at the
date and time indicated on the Class Calendar.
Emergencies happen, so you are allowed one “Late Pass” without penalty, which gives you an additional 2 days (48 hours) to complete a single Project.
Thereafter, you will not be able to turn in any late projects under any circumstances, unless you already have a prior exemption for a Religious Holy Day, a school-
sponsored trip, or a doctor's note, obituary, or other serious issue that you can document with a written excuse.
To use your Late Pass, BEFORE the project is due, click HERE.
Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and / or
dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on academic dishonesty will be
strictly enforced. For further information, please visit the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct
(http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct) .
E-Mail
In this course, e-mail will be used as a means of communication. Please specify your class (don't worry about your EID) in e-mails--your prof teaches multiple large
classes. Also, please use the @utexas e-mail instead of the Canvas Inbox, since we are more likely to receive it on any device. You will be responsible for
checking your e-mail regularly for class work and announcements, as well as Canvas. You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for University e-mail here
(http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy) .
SSD Accommodations
If you have already discussed your needs with Student Services, and received an Accommodation Letter, you still must discuss specific accommodations with your
professor. Please let me know, as soon as possible, if you will need specific accommodations, such as additional time on tests, assistance with notes, or class
materials. We are happy to work with you to ensure you have everything you need. However, if you do not specifically discuss this with your professor, and have
an official letter from SSD, you will not be allowed an exception.
Title IX
The University of Texas is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students that is free of all forms of discrimination and sexual harassment,
including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you (or someone you know) has experienced or experiences any of these incidents,
know that you are not alone. The University has staff members trained to support you in navigating campus life, accessing health and counseling services,

providing academic and housing accommodations, helping with legal protective orders, and more.
Please be aware all UT faculty members are “responsible employees,” which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual
assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator. Although I have to make that notification, you
will control how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of
options available to you and have access to the resources you need. Here are additional resources: https://titleix.utexas.edu/helpful-handouts
