                               Summer 2019, First Session – Unique ID 86350
 Instructor:   Dr. Kirk Blazek
 Lecture:      MTWThF 10-11:15 in RLM 5.104
Catalog Description: Techniques of matrix calculations and applications of linear algebra.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 408C, 408K, or 408N with a grade of at least C-.
Text: Lay, Linear Algebra and its applications, 5th Edition, Addison Wesley.
Attendance: I will not take attendance, but there will be twice weekly quizzes which will serve to keep
track of attendance. Class participation will be considered in borderline grades.
Homework and Quizzes: Problem sets will be assigned twice a week. The homework will not be handed
in for a grade, but at the beginning of each class on Tuesdays and Fridays there will be a brief quiz cov-
ering the material from the most recent homework. The quiz will be a single question directly from the
homework. You are allowed to use your own homework for the quiz, but are allowed no other outside
assistance, such as from your book or a calculator. There will no makeup quizzes, but your lowest quiz
grade over the course of the class will be dropped.
Exams: This course will have a midterm and a final. The midterm will be given on Friday, June 21st in
class at the usual time (there will be no quiz this day) and the final will be on Saturday, July 13th from
7pm-10pm. The midterm will take place over the entire class time (rather than the brief time allotted for
quizzes). As this is a computation-heavy subject, you will be allowed to use scientific calculators on the
exams, but are allowed no other outside assistance, whether written, electronic, or otherwise.
Makeup Exams: I do not give makeup exams after the class has taken their test, but if you know before-
hand you will be unable to be there for an exam, let me know and you may be able to take an alternative
exam early. If you miss an exam, you must let me know immediately in order to discuss possible arrange-
ments. However, don’t expect a whole lot unless you missed the exam due to medical reasons that can be
confirmed with a doctor’s note.
Grading: This class is graded on the +/- scale. The overall grade will be determined by the given during
the class as well as well as the quizzes.
    An A will be given for an overall grade of 93 and up, an A- is given for 90-93, a B+ for 87-90, a B for
83-87, a B- for 80-83, etc. Please note that since the grade ranges for most of the grades are 3 or 4 points,
there is not much rounding (e.g., an 86.5 is still a B, but an 86.95 will round to a B+).
