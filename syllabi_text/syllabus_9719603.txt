Instructor: Dr. Christopher Long
Office: Sutton Hall 4.104
Phone: 232.4084
E-mail: chrlong@utexas.edu
Office Hours: T TH 10-11; and by appointment
Time and Place: T TH 12:30-2:00; BTL 101
Prerequisites: Architecture students must have previously taken surveys 1 and 2 unless they
have permission from the instructor. Upper-division undergraduate and graduate students from
other departments are welcome to enroll with the consent of the instructor.
Description: This course will explore the history of architecture and design in the lands that
made up the Habsburg Empire and its successor states (Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia,
southern Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, northern Romania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, northern Italy, and
western Ukraine) from the time of the Baroque to the present, focusing on the rise of the
modernism in the region. In addition to surveying the significant building and design trends, the
lectures will examine the works and ideas of a number of important architects, including J. B.
Fischer von Erlach, Otto Wagner, Adolf Loos, Josef Hoffmann, Jože Plečnik, Ödön Lechner, Jan
Kotěra, and Josef Frank. The course will also include a discussion of the development of the
major cities of the region—Vienna, Prague, and Budapest—examining how industrialization,
rapid urbanization, and war shaped the distinctive face of each metropolis. The course will be
taught in a combined lecture and seminar format.
Educational Objectives: The aim of this course is to familiarize students with the historical
development of architecture in Central Europe; to introduce them to the basic trends and leading
architects and designers; and to acquaint them with the way in which historical change has
shaped the region's built environment.
Course Requirements: Class attendance is required. Grades will be based on one mid-term
examination (worth 30% of the final grade), one paper (undergraduates, 12-15 pages, graduate
students 15-20 pages; 40%; due on the final class day), and a comprehensive final examination
(30%). Plus/minus grading will be used for this course.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MID-TERM AND FINAL EXAMINATIONS
BE SURE TO BRING A BLUE BOOK TO EACH EXAM (12 PAGES OR MORE). DO NOT WRITE
ANYTHING IN THE BLUE BOOK UNTIL YOU ARE INSTRUCTED TO DO SO!
Each exam will consist of one question, with several parts. Before you begin writing, take a few
moments to ensure you understand what is being asked of you. Answer the entire question!
Make sure your answer is clear and well organized. Make a brief outline or plan your answer.
Be consistent. If you take one position, be sure that all of your arguments follow from it. Do not
start your answer arguing one idea and then change to another position. If you get off to a bad
start, cross out what you have written and begin again. Remember: the clarity of your thoughts
and the persuasiveness of your argument are crucial aspects of your answer. You must write
your answer in prose. Simple lists or outlines are not acceptable.
Be thorough. Answer the questions fully. Be sure to bring in material not from only the lectures
but also from the readings. Some questions will require you deal with material from several
lectures or readings. Consider the question fully and avoid merely "regurgitating" what you have
heard or read.
Write well. Take the time to make sure that your essays are well written. Avoid awkward
phrases and passive voice constructions. Watch your spelling and do not use words whose
meanings you may not be sure of. Leave a few minutes at the end of the exam period to read over
your answer and correct any obvious mistakes.


                                                                                                      9
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE FINAL PAPER
Pick one aspect of the material we will cover in class (it can the work of a particular architect or
designer, a building, a theoretical writing, a movement, or some other issue) and discuss its
import and meaning. Note: your task is not merely to describe, but also to analyze your chosen
subject. If you are in doubt about the appropriateness of your idea, please consult with me.
Undergraduate papers should be approximately 12-15 pages in length (exclusive of illustrations,
notes, and bibliography); graduate papers should be approximately 15-20 pages.
Final papers are due on November 20.
Papers should be submitted on regular 8 1/2-by-11 inch paper, in 10, 11 or 12-point type. Staple
the upper left hand corner. Please do not use plastic covers or other bindings.
For notes follow the regular format used in the Journal of the Society of Architectural
Historians. Use endnotes. Text reference numbers for endnotes should be placed at the ends of
sentences. In the sequence of elements within a note, do not precede parenthesis with a comma.
In the page number citations, avoid f. or ff.; use inclusive page numbers.
