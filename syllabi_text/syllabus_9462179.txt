Description
This course examines the musical legacy of the African slave trade in the Americas, the
social contexts in which black music has developed, and its varied forms. It considers
particular African ethnic groups represented prominently in the New World, the
traditions they brought with them, and the ways they have been adapted to new ends.
Emphasis will be placed on the similarities and differences between the music of black
communities in North America and those in the Caribbean and South America. Other
themes include the shifting meanings of black music in various contexts, the notion of
hybridity and mixture as they relate to black culture, and the uses of African-influenced
music as a political or oppositional tool. Students will be provided an opportunity to sing
and/or play music whenever possible.
         “Music of the African Diaspora” carries the Global Cultures flag. Global
Cultures courses are designed to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the
United States. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come
from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S.
cultural group, past or present.
Readings
No textbooks have been ordered for the course. Instead, a selection of assigned reading
and listening has been assembled from various sources. These are available through
Canvas.
Listening


                                                          Music of the African Diaspora, p. 2
Students are asked to listen to two or three musical examples each class session and to be
responsible for recognizing and identifying them on exams. You will be asked to
remember something about the histories, contexts, functions, and social significance of
assigned music. For each piece assigned, I suggest making a list for review that includes
the following information:
        —The title of the piece and the author if known
        —The approximate time it was written, within a decade
        —The culture area/country with which it is associated
        —The lyrics of the piece, what they discuss
        —The instrumentation of the piece
        —The typical contexts in which it is performed
        —The formal musical characteristics of the piece
        —Any other aspects of the piece’s social meaning
        Students are required to attend classes and labs, to keep up with the reading and
listening, to respond with comments to readings on Canvas posts, to participate actively
in discussion in class, to take exams on the assigned day, and to complete all assignments
punctually. Grades for undergraduates will be determined on the basis of three in-class
exams, other small assignments (postings to Canvas, a concert review), a final oral
presentation, class participation, and attendance. The three exams will constitute 60% of
the student’s overall grade, the minor assignments 15% (postings 10%, concert review
5%), the oral presentation 10%, attendance 10%, and class participation 5%.
        In-class exams for students will consist of three parts: (1) the identification of key
terms, ideas, or people; (2) discussion of assigned listening examples; and (3) the writing
of a short essay on a topic related to class assignments. Students will be provided with a
review sheet prior to a given test that lists key terms they are to be responsible for, and
possible essay topics. The essay will be evaluated in terms of the following categories:
organization, grammar/syntax, reference to musical examples in support of arguments,
use of relevant musical terminology, and full response to all aspects of the question
posed.
        Students may opt to write an 8-10 pp. paper instead of taking one of the midterm
exams or the final. If they choose the paper option, they should refer to the writing
guidelines below for graduate students. Those planning to write a paper must provide the
instructor and TA with a proposed topic and bibliography no later than week 5 and an
outline of the paper by week 7.
        Missed Test Policy
        You are required to keep track of scheduled test days on the syllabus and to take
tests when they are scheduled. Students missing tests without a medical excuse will not
be allowed to make them up, so please don’t forget to come.
        Attendance
        Regular attendance is important because various activities that take place in class
(the screening of video clips, musical demonstrations or performance opportunities,
collective discussion, guest presentations, and so on) cannot be experienced through
individual work at home. The same is true for attendance in discussion section. For that
reason, attendance in both class and sections is mandatory and will be monitored.


                                                          Music of the African Diaspora, p. 3
Attendance will be assigned 45 points and after the first 3 unexcused absences by a given
student each absence will result in 3 lost points.
        Participation
        Your participation grade will be based on meaningful participation in collective
discussions. Meaningful participation is taken to be engagement with the texts and course
themes. Each student is expected to come to class prepared to participate actively in
discussion. Those who are willing to actively participate by sharing their thoughts on a
regular basis will graded highly in this area. Those who participate infrequently in class
discussions will be graded down.
        While you may bring your electronic devices to class for the purposes of note-
taking or web browsing related to class activities, please do not abuse the privilege by
using your device to email, IM, text message, update your social media, or browse the
web in ways not related to class activity – it distracts your classmates and detracts from
their learning experience as well as yours.
        Concert Reviews
        As noted, one concert review is required of all students. The review should be 3
or 4 pages in length, typed and double-spaced. The overall goal of the assignment is that
you experience music making live and develop an appropriate vocabulary with which to
describe/discuss it. Please consult at least two authoritative written sources (in addition to
class readings) in order to acquire background information on the styles of music you
hear at the concert; the sources should be formally cited and referenced in the review.
You should also conduct a brief interview with one of the performers following the event
and incorporate what you learn from them into your review. See the “Extra Credit
Options” section below about concerts for a listing of possible events to attend. Other
concerts may be appropriate, but require approval in advance from either the Instructor
or TA. Please hand in your review no later than Tuesday of Week 15 unless special
arrangements are made.
        Individual Projects
        You will prepare a final class presentation on music in a small group (usually 2-4
students) by researching a particular musical artist, genre, or national or regional musical
style of your choice. Focus on particular aspects of Afrodiasporic music as appropriate
and discuss it with the class for 15 minutes. Some portion of the presentation should
discuss or analyze music per se: instruments, sounds, rhythms, etc., and the remainder
can focus on topics such as historical background/development, contemporary social
meanings of the repertoire, changes in style, accompanying dance, etc. You will begin
planning these presentations collectively in section.
        The presentation of your individual research should be accompanied by visual
aids. These may consist of images on Powerpoint or Keynote. These files (including any
mp3 music files to be played) should be given to the TA at the class meeting prior to the
presentation so that they can be uploaded to the class computer. The talk should also
include audio examples: recorded music, youtube video, or other sources. Up to two
minutes of your talk may be devoted to playing music.
        Assignments for Graduate Students


                                                           Music of the African Diaspora, p. 4
         Graduate students who enroll in the course as MUS 380 will complete an
individual project on a topic of their choice that relates to course content. It may consist
of a performance (learning a new piece of music), musical analysis, a transcription, a
research paper, or any other project approved by the instructor. If written, individual
projects should be roughly 12-15 pp. in length, excluding notes and bibliography.
         In addition, graduate music students are required to complete two additional
tasks: First, they must transcribe and analyze at least one minute’s worth of music related
to the class listening. This task may be incorporated into and/or support their final
project, or it may be separate from it. Second, they must learn to play and/or sing a
representative piece or rhythm of repertoire unfamiliar to them that relates to the course.
Again, this may be incorporated into to their final project or not, as they choose. Students
may demonstrate their performance skills to the class as part of final class presentations
if they wish.
         A two-page description/outline for the written project and an accompanying
bibliography is due during week 5, and a draft of the project is due week 11. The final
version of the paper (assuming additional revisions are necessary) as well as the
transcriptions and recording of musical performance (in the case of graduate music
students) will be due on Tuesday of the last week of classes. This schedule will ensure
that the instructor has time to interact with you as you define the project and conduct
your research. Graduate students are welcome to combine the topic of their individual
research paper and/or musical transcriptions and performance work with their final class
presentation.
         For graduates, the exams will constitute 25% of the overall grade, the final 15%,
the individual project 30%, the transcription and performance/recording 10%, the
postings/oral presentation 10%, and attendance 10%.
Extra Credit Options
Performance Ensembles. It is the intention of this course to encourage active
participation in musical experiences to the greatest extent possible. Therefore, any
student interested in enrolling and participating in a one-unit world music performance
ensemble at the University of Texas in conjunction with this course will have their lowest
test score raised to an A. If you decide to pursue this option, please notify your instructor
and TA as soon as possible. You will need to formally enroll in an ensemble by the 12     th
day of classes.
Appropriate ensembles in the Music School include:
     (1) African American Vocal Ens, (meets Mon 7-10pm in MRH 2.634)

     (3) Hispanic Caribbean Ensemble (meets Wed 5-8pm in MRH 6.252)
     (4) Middle Eastern Ensemble (meets Thurs 7-10pm in MRH 2.614)
Other groups in the School of Music such as jazz combos may be appropriate to enroll in
as well, if approved by the instructor. Students may also opt to join a group outside of
UT for the semester, or to take private lessons on an instrument related to course subject
matter. If participation or instruction of this sort is duly documented, you will receive
substantial extra credit depending on the extent and length of the commitment. Students
must attend such rehearsals regularly or take at least five private lessons. Note that those
pursuing one of these options must present a 2-3pp. written summary at the end of the
semester that describes their participation in the group/lessons, the material covered, and


                                                         Music of the African Diaspora, p. 5
