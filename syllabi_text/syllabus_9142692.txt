COURSE SUMMARY:
Construction One is a broad survey of construction, including materials, trades,
systems, and methods of fabrication and installation. For students of architecture,
interior design, and historic preservation, Construction One is the first course in a
series of four required building construction/building structures courses.
OBJECTIVES:
The material, assembly, and detailing determinations an architect makes in authoring
a project are vital design decisions. Developing a familiarity with the physical
characteristics of materials, functions of assemblies and systems, means and
methods of building, legal and cultural conditions affecting the work of the building
trades, and ecological ramifications of both the production and operation of projects is
a fundamental goal of this class. Upon this foundation of information and experience,
the student of architecture can begin to construct a deeper knowledge of how
architectural propositions engage the physical world. Construction and materiality can
be a rich source of architectural argument, and building understanding of this subject
enables invention and deployment of material and assembly strategies that reinforce,
as well as generate, architectural concepts.
FORMAT:
Two lecture and discussion sessions each week will include instructor presentations
prefaced by a brief quiz on the assigned reading material and followed by a brief
question period. The course is structured as two sequential phases. The first half of
the class (weeks 1-8) is a ‘Construction Systems’ sequence examining significant
building trades and materials, including sources, physical properties, uses in
construction, means of fabrication, and methods of installation. In the second half of
the class, the lecture topics cover a series of influential issues which impact material
and building system decisions but are not tied to a single material category.
In addition, students are required to attend a laboratory once a week where you will
participate in field trips to manufacturing plants and/or construction sites, work with
quantitative methods related to building performance, and present and work on your
class projects. Please report to the assigned classroom for lab unless an alternate
meeting location has been announced in the prior lecture session.


Students are expected to approach the required reading as research to be completed
prior to each lecture. The content of the lectures and the reading will be
complementary, and successful completion of the course will require knowledge
acquired from both sources.

ASSESSMENT:
EXAMS – 50% OF YOUR GRADE
Closed book exams, scheduled following the completion of approximately each third of
the class sequence, will test each student’s ability to recall factual material and apply
construction knowledge. Comprised of 15-25 questions, exams will require short answer,
drawing and diagramming. Except as required by University policies, make up exams will
not be offered.
UNIT REVIEWS – 17% OF YOUR GRADE
Open book, take home research modules are packets of 15-20 questions approached as
an examination of course content. Unit Reviews will challenge each student to deploy
material and construction fact and theory through short answer, essay, drawing and
diagramming. Unit Reviews shall be completed individually. Two Unit Reviews are
scheduled during the fifteen week semester and will be distributed after a Thursday
lecture to be returned at the beginning of the following Thursday lecture. The final third of
the class material will not have a Unit Review. Late work will not be accepted.


LAB EXERCISES, PROJECTS, AND PARTICIPATION; QUIZZES – 33% OF YOUR GRADE
Lab exercises and projects will be assigned during the semester.
COURSE POLICIES:
GROUP WORK:
Group work requires equal participation from all members. Any individual not
performing a commensurate share of the work may be eliminated from the group but
is still responsible for satisfaction of the assignment requirements.
ATTENDANCE:
Attendance is expected, and may be recorded at all lectures and labs at the
instructor’s discretion. Any student with more than two documented absences may be
dropped from the class or the student’s final grade will be adjusted a letter grade less
for each additional absence.
GRADING:
Final grades are derived from problem sets, pop quizzes, exams, unit reviews and the
research project. Final grading is based on a 100 point scale in a plus/minus system.
A      93 – 100              B-     80 – 82            D+     67 – 69
A-     90 – 92               C+     77 – 79            D      63 – 66
B+     87 – 89               C      73 – 76            D-     60 – 62
B      83 – 86               C-     70 – 72            F      59 or lower
The grades accumulated over the semester are averaged to a final grade as follows:
EXAMS (1, 2, 3 : in-class)                                    50%
UNIT REVIEWS (1, 2 : take home)                               17%
LAB EXERCISES/PROJECTS/PARTICIPATION; QUIZZES                 33%
The Office of Graduate Studies requires a grade of at least C (73-76) for a course to
be included in a graduate student’s program of work.


Observance of Religious Holidays:
A student who is absent from a class or other required activities, including
examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day may complete the work
missed within a reasonable time after the absence, if proper notice has been given.
Students should deliver written notice to the instructor, in person, as far in advance of
the class absence as possible, but not less than seven days prior to the classes
scheduled on the dates the student will be absent. A student who fails to complete
missed work within the time allowed will be subject to the normal academic penalties.
Students with Disabilities:
The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact
the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY.
Scholastic Dishonesty:
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to
disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal
from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the
integrity of University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For
further information please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs.
Field Trip Conduct:
Field trips to visit construction sites and building material manufacturing operations
will occur during both lecture and lab sessions. For these field trips, you must wear
long pants, closed toe shoes, and bring hard hats and safety glasses (which will be
provided by the school). Promptness and professional on-site conduct is essential to
the continued success of the visits.
