                                                      Course Description
  University Catalog Course Description
The course will help students understand the nature and importance of the huge shift in communication in the sports world that has
occurred with the advent of social media, enabling instantaneous two-way communication between players and their fans, shifting
media power toward individuals, away from traditional media, enabling immediate dissemination, feedback, reaction, and criticism.
  What will I learn?
• Students will learn how to understand and appreciate the unique and powerful fit that sports and social media exhibit, based on an
appreciation of fan avidity and the emotional desire sports fans have to express themselves, be identified with and recognized by
their chosen teams, athletes, brands, and sports organizations.
• Students will understand the best practices, techniques, tools and philosophies being used by sports organizations to drive and
measure engagement and content amplification.
• Students will have realistic opportunities to disseminate and emulate best practices through hands on exercises and relevant social
engagements and projects.
• Students will gain an understanding how sports organizations maintain a consistent dialog with their fans all year long, and how
analytics through unique content and social engagements have dramatically changed how teams and individual players engage,
interact and communicate with interested fans and sports enthusiasts.
• Students will learn the history of communications in the sports so that they can better understand the dramatic shift from
traditional media to today’s social media landscape.
  Learning Outcomes
1. Students will be able to measure the effectiveness of social media topics, posting times, platforms, and other variables in terms of
audience response and engagement
2. Students will be able to differentiate the strengths and limitations of different social media platforms
3. Students will be able to define goals for social media engagement and optimize social media posts to achieve those goals.
4. Students experience working in groups as a social media team, working with each other to post compelling content in an
environment of irregular timing and unpredictable opportunities.
5. Students will be able to use and deploy basic social planning techniques including “tent-pole” planning, evergreen content,
developing and using a content calendar, assessing engagement results to drive future action.
6. Students will be able to effectively use a basic set of design and production tools to create social posts that follow best practices
and take advantage of visual guidelines to tell the organizations story, with desired results to help increase awareness, fan avidity and
drive engagement.
  How will I learn?
Through class participation, spirited classroom discussions weighing the pros and cons of specific social postings, assigned readings,
lectures, specific targeted assignments, group and individual projects and through experiences related by invited industry guests, will
all be used to combine theory and skill development to help understand effective communications in the social media space.
  Pre-requisites for the course
Upper-division standing and a University grade point average of at least 2.25.
                                                                       1


 How to succeed in this course

Required devices
Laptop computer (or tablet) and a smartphone. If one of these devices is not available, see instructor for options.
Index cards
Students will need to keep a supply of 3 x 5 index cards with their name, and EID to turn in measure participation and contribution
                                                      Classroom expectations
  Class Attendance
Attendance is required for all class meetings and contributes a potential of 4 points to your final grade. In class assignments will get a
score of zero in the case of unexcused absences. For each unexcused absence after the second instance, a student will lose one of
the available 4 attendance points. An excused absence is defined as a documented illness, documented University-related absence
(sports team travel) and religious holidays (prior notification required). Excused absence for illness requires health provider
documentation. Attendance will be taken through daily class participation. Excused absences due to sports participation can be
arranged in advance through the instructor.
  Class Participation
Class participation is essential and ranks at the top of factors students use to define a valuable course. Class participation forms part
of your grade in this class. Credit for the 6 participation points available will be based upon the student turning in 3x5 index cards
(which students should always carry a supply of) with their name, EID the topic they contributed to and a description of the
contribution. Two points will be awarded for each appropriately completed and accepted card.
  Behavior expectations
Since much of this class look at the factors that appeal to avid sports fans, passionate enthusiasm is encouraged. However, it is also
important that students show behave respectfully in a civil manner. Avoid creating classroom distractions. Excessive off topic and
private conversations or device use qualifies as a distraction.
Assignments
Class Prep Assignments
There will be approximately 10 Class Prep Assignments given out over the course of the term. They will primarily deal with finding
relevant examples of certain social posts or the use of particular posting tools. They may also consist of readings with a graded quiz
with discussion questions. If a different number of assignments are given, the available points will be divided accordingly based on
the number of assignments.
                                                                       2


Two Projects will focus on:
1) Auditing one or more sports team social media account and providing an analysis of posting habits including generated metrics.
We will be monitoring social posts from a specific franchise in the NFL, MLB, and an NCAA teams as well.
2) Working within a social media team to strategize and create posts to meet given objectives, including a graded realworld
opportunity with the Class A affiliate of the Houston Astros.

                                                          Policies
Classroom Policies
Statement on Learning Success
    Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn differently. If
    there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible.
    Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you
    to reach out to the student resources available through UT. Many are listed on this syllabus, but I am happy to connect
    you with a person or Center if you would like.
Grading Policies
    As I hope you can see, flexibility is built into the assignments to support your success in this course. If you miss a
    smaller assignment or don’t do as well on your earlier journal entries, your grade will not be impacted significantly.
    Consequently, the final grades are firm, and no additional curve is available.
           Grade            Cutoff           Points needed
           A                94%              940
           A-               90%              900
           B+               87%              870
           B                84%              840
           B-               80%              800
           C+               77%              770
           C                74%              740
           C-               70%              700

           F                <65%             <650
 GRACE POLICY: Time-bank options
     Sometimes we have bad days, bad weeks, and bad semesters. In an effort to accommodate any unexpected,
     unfortunate personal crisis, I have built “time banks” into our course. You do not have to utilize this policy, but if you
     find yourself struggling with unexpected personal events, I encourage you to e-mail me as soon as possible to notify
     me that you are using our grace policy. You may use this policy one of two ways (please choose, and let me know):
                 You may have a two-day grace period for one assignment, OR
                 You may have 2 one-day extensions for two different assignments.
 Absences
     If you are absent on the day that your team meets, you are responsible for providing your team with the necessary
     information to compensate for your absence. It is crucial to keep in communication with your team members; you are
     responsible for letting both us and your team know if you cannot make it to a class.
     Excused Absence: The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious holidays or extenuating
     circumstances due to an emergency. If you plan to miss class due to observance of a religious holiday, please let us
     know at least two weeks in advance. You will not be penalized for this absence, although you will still be responsible
     for any work you will miss on that day if applicable. Check with us for details or arrangements.
                                                                 6


      If you have to be absent, use your resources wisely. Ask your team and other classmates to get a run-down and notes
      on any lessons you miss. If you find there are topics that we covered while you were gone that raise questions, you
      may come by during office hours or schedule a meeting to discuss. Email specific questions you have in advance so
      that we can make the most of our time. “What did I miss?” is not specific enough.

     • You are responsible for holding yourself accountable to these standards, holding each other to these standards,
          and holding the teaching team accountable as well.
Personal Pronoun Use (She / He / They / Ze / Etc)
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with
differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters
are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless they have added a “preferred name” with the
Gender and Sexuality Center (http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-resources/). I will gladly
honor your request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster, and by the
gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so that I may
make appropriate updates to my records.
University Resources for Students
 Services for Students with Disabilities
      This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are circumstances that
      make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information that you need to share with
      me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am
      committed to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs
      with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. Any student with a
      documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities
      at 471-6259 (voice) or 512-410-6644 (Video Phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining
      authorized accommodations. For more information, visit http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/.
                                                                   7


Counseling and Mental Health Center
     Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol,
     getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
     All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available
     on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner
     rather than later is often helpful.
     If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression,
     we strongly encourage you to seek support. http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html
The Sanger Learning Center
     Did you know that more than one-third of UT undergraduate students use the Sanger Learning Center each year to
     improve their academic performance? All students are welcome to take advantage of Sanger Center’s classes and
     workshops, private learning specialist appointments, peer academic coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses
     in 15 different subject areas. For more information, please visit http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/slc or call 512-471-3614

     The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security,
     512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
     Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire
     alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
 •   Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest
     exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
 •   Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
 •   In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless
     given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or
     Fire Prevention Services office.

Title IX Reporting
      Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault,
      sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is
      committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual
      misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
           1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
           2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become
                involved in a Title IX investigation.
           3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
      Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters,”
      which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible
      Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one.
      Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether
      they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without making an
      official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options
      and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.

      integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your
      own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of
      plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
      understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and theUniversity Honor Code which can be found at the following

 Q Drop Policy
      If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline,
      which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you
      are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
