               Government and Politics of South Asia
                                         (GC)
Course Description:
South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land by West Asia,
Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. This sub-region comprises eight developing
countries—Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and
Sri Lanka. South Asia is home to well over one fifth of the world's population, making it
the most populous geographical region in the world.
Since the end of the Cold War, South Asia has become a focal point of growing
international attention and concern by nuclear proliferation, the rise of Islamic militancy
and the anti-terror war, the emergence of India as a global power, and regional effort for
cooperation. South Asian nations have also been experiencing a profound political
evolution of democratization.
This course provides students with a comprehensive and systematic introduction to the
comparative political study of the eight nations of South Asia. Organized in parallel
fashion to facilitate cross-national comparison, the course sections on each nation address
                                                                                          1


several topical areas of inquiry: political culture and heritage, government structure and
institutions, political parties and leaders, and social conflict and resolution. India, the
preeminent power of the subcontinent, will receive more attention. In terms of the
international relations of the region, this course will address several predominant
region-wide issues: the India–Pakistan conflict, the rise of Islamic militancy and the
AfPak war, and regional cooperation under the South Asian Association of Regional
Cooperation (SAARC).
This course also carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed
to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Prerequisites:
Since this is an introductory course, a background in Asian studies or Government is
recommended but not required.
Grading Policy:
Two mid-term exams (60%).
One short term paper of 6-7 pages (30%, first draft 15% and final draft 15%)
Overall class participation/attendance may be reflected in a plus or minus up to l0 points
in determining the course grade.
Any student missing a mid-term exam with a verified medical excuse or for an official
university event with a letter from the responsible university authority may choose to take
a make-up exam or do an alternative assignment.
We will adopt UT's new "plus & minus" grading system in this course. The following is a
list of letter grades, their corresponding GPA values, and the percentage values that I plan
to use for your assignments. Note that these percentage scores will not be noted on your
transcript.
