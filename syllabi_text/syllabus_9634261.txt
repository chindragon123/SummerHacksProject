Brief Description: This class is intended to help you develop the ability to perform more involved
experiments and to write up the results in a coherent, complete manner. Emphasis will be placed on
laboratory techniques, measurement analysis including error analysis, and effective presentation.
The physics topics are drawn from the set of ‘non-classical’ topics, that is related to quantum
phenomena, special relativity and the atomic structure of matter.
Resources - The text is Experimentation, by Baird. This is a generally useful book for data
analysis and report preparation. There are many similar books that cover the same material, so
this book is not required. However, you will want some such book at your disposal and this is a
good one.
    The PMA computer center in RLM 7.122 has a number of software packages installed that you
can use for data analysis and report preparation. These include: Mathematica, GnuPlot, MatLAB,
KaleidaGraph, a LaTex package, as well as the complete Microsoft Office. Some tutorials, a LaTeX
report template and a guide to report writing will be placed on the Canvas site. Generally, you are
free to use whichever software you like to do data analysis and report preparation. There is one
exception: no Excel graphs!
    A detailed document dealing with data analysis and report preparation prepared specifically
for this lab can be found in the Files section on Canvas, filename skillmanual.pdf
    A short introduction to the GnuPlot plotting program can be found in the Files section on
Canvas, filename GnuPlot Primer.pdf
    All of the material associated with the PHY110C student led seminar also covering data analysis
and report preparation can be found at
  http://eaott.github.io/data-analysis/
    Background information of the individual experiments are found at
    http://www.ph.utexas.edu/~phy353l
    The username is phy353l and the password is juniorlab This site will be your primary
resource in selecting and performing experiments.
Grading - The breakdown is:
    • Written Lab Reports 75 points
    • Oral Exam 8 points
    • data analysis problem set 8 points
    • lab participation (TA and instructor evaluation) and lab book 10 points


Written Reports: There will be five written lab reports plus a practise data analysis problem set.
The grade scale will be provided when the first lab report is returned. The due dates for reports
are on the lab calender. Your reports will be submitted electronically and details on how to do this
will be provided. Late reports: don’t even go there. If you get behind this summer you will not
catch up.
    The choice of labs and the order you do them are largely up to you. Generally, you will work in
groups of two with occasional exceptions. Note that only one group in a given section can be doing
a particular experiment during a given week, so look over the available labs and sign up promptly
for the ones that interest you.
Data Analysis Homework: The data analysis problem set is available on Canvas in the Assign-
ments section. Submission is online as a PDF file. Due date for the first part is Friday, June 15 by
midnight. The full assignment is due Friday, June 22 by midnight.
Oral Exam: You will be required to have an oral report on one lab. This is in addition to the
written report on the same lab as detailed above. Oral reports are to be 15 minutes (rigorously
enforced) in length and will be conducted during weeks 3 and 4 over lab 2 or 3 (your choice). These
will be one-on-one with the instructor. Examinations will be scheduled using the Canvas calendar
and you must sign up for by Friday, June 22.
Lab Book: You are required to have a lab notebook. This must be bound and not loose pages.
You should develop the habit of writing in your notebook. A lot. Diagrams and sketches are viewed
with particular favor. The TA’s will be periodically be checking your notebook and this will be
part of your participation points.
Other: The last date to drop the course with a possible refund is June 8, 2018. Last day a student
may drop a class with required approvals is July 12, 2018. Note: July 4 fall on a Wednesday and
is a no class day, but the rest of the week is regular lab/class time.
    If you are absent for the observance of a religious holy day you may complete the work missed
within a reasonable time after the absence, if proper notice has been given. Notice must be given
at least seven days prior to absence.
    The University of Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students
at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY.
Writing Flag: This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give
students experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write
regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from
your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one
or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag
classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork,
and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
