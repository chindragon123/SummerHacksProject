Catalog Description Animation can bring characters, objects, and graphics to life. It’s the backbone of the computer graphics
                    industry and plays an important role in film, visual effects, games, and motion graphics. This course is an
                    introduction to the principles of animation for 2D and 3D systems. Students will use various techniques
                    to convey a sense of weight, emotion, and story for simple and complex objects in both 2D and 3D.
Prerequisite(s)     Upper division standing; Arts and Entertainment Technologies 306.
Course Materials    A computer capable of running Adobe CC (Photoshop, Animate, After Effects) and Maya. A Wacom
                    tablet is recommended.
Objectives &        This course is focused on using industry standard 2D and 3D software packages to create animations that
Assessment          apply traditional animation principles and techniques.
                    By the end of the course, students should be able to:
                          1.) Identify and apply the 12 principles of animation
                          2.) Use 2D and 3D animation software packages to execute animated sequences
                          3.) Create real time engine ready animated 2D sprites
                          4.) Create a 3D animated Walk Cycle
Grading             This course is project based. There will be no exams. Assignments are worth 70% and the final project is
                    worth 20% of the final class grade. The remaining 10% of the final grade is based on professionalism
                    which is earned by attending class during the scheduled meeting times and conducting oneself in a
                    professional manner.
                    No late work will be accepted. No incompletes will be given. If you feel you will not be able to complete
                    all the work on time, you should ask the instructor for a grade of Q or drop before the deadline for doing
                    so passes.
                    Grading breakdown:
                    Each assignment (including the final project) will be graded according to the following rubric:
                    Requirements: 60 points Quality of presentation: 30 Points Professionalism 10 points
                    Final grades will be determined using the following grade distribution. Please note: to ensure fairness, all
                    numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will be inclusive of all
                    scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not recognize the grade of A+.
                     A = 94 - 100          B+ = 87 - 89         C+ = 77 - 79          D+ = 67 - 69        F = 0 - 60
                     A- = 90 - 93          B = 84 - 84          C = 74 - 76           D = 64 - 69
                                           B- = 80 - 83         C- = 70 - 73          D- = 60 - 63
Professionalism     Professionalism is expected of all students and includes attending class during scheduled meeting times,
                    communicating clearly, respecting peers, and taking the class seriously. Rolling into class 15 minutes late
                    with a Starbucks ... while texting … on a skateboard … with earbuds blasting Kpop is NOT professional
                    conduct. However, if you catch the flu, get a flat tire, or otherwise cannot attend class, please contact
                    BOTH the instructor and TA, and attach any class work as needed. Please note 3 unexcused absences will
                    lower your course grade by one letter.
                                                                                                                              1


UT Electronic Mail  Electronic mail (e-mail) is a mechanism for official University and instructor communication to students.
Notification Policy Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with
                    University- and course-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be
                    time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week.
                    It is the responsibility of every student to keep the University and instructor informed of changes in his
                    or her official e-mail address (do so at https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/bio/address_change.WBX).
                    Consequently, e-mail returned to the University with "User Unknown" is not an acceptable excuse for
                    missed communication. Similarly, undeliverable messages returned because of a full inbox or use of a
                    spam filter will be considered delivered without further action required of the University or instructor.
                    (see ​http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy​)
Use of Class        The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, and homework
Materials           assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the class materials is a
                    violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the student.
                    Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may
                    be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could
                    result in further disciplinary action. This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to
                    websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students.
                    (from https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/coursematerials/Sample+Use+Statement+for+Syllabus)
Religious Holidays  Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code states that a student shall be excused from attending classes
                    or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including
                    travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized
                    for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the
                    student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy requires students to
                    notify each of their instructors at least fourteen days prior to the date they will be absent from
                    scheduled classes to observe a religious holy day.
                    (from ​http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/1555_001.pdf​)
Classroom           Please observe the following rules during class as a courtesy to fellow students and the instructor.
Etiquette
                    1) Be on time at the beginning of class. If you must come in late at the beginning of class, please enter
                    the room and seat yourself as quietly and unobtrusively as possible.
                    2) Turn off your cell phone’s notification sounds upon entering the classroom. If you forget to do so, and
                    your phone rings, chirps, or vibrates loudly during class, turn it off immediately and discreetly.
                    3) Food is not allowed in class. Drinks in closed containers are permitted but must be kept on the floor or
                    out of sight when not in use.
Academic Integrity  The University's ​Honor Code​ states that “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide
                    by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” You are expected to maintain
                    absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in scholastic work undertaken at the
                    University. At a minimum, you should complete any assignments, exams, and other scholastic endeavors
                    with the utmost honesty, which requires you to:
                           ● acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts;
                           ● complete your assignments independently unless expressly authorized to seek or obtain
                                assistance in preparing them;
                           ● follow instructions for assignments and exams, and observe the standards of your academic
                                discipline; and
                           ● avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another student.
                    (adapted from ​http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php​)
                                                                                                                                2


Academic           In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines academic dishonesty
Dishonesty         as including ​any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved academic advantage​, such as:
                         ● Cheating
                         ● Plagiarism
                         ● Unauthorized Collaboration / Collusion
                         ● Falsifying Academic Records
                         ● Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain an
                               extended deadline for an assignment, or even gain an unearned financial benefit)
                         ● M​ultiple submissions​ (submitting essentially the same written assignment for two courses
                               without authorization to do so)
                         ● Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity
                   (adapted from ​http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php​)
                   Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
                   including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
                   (from ​http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_faculty_syllabus.php​)
Plagiarism         “Plagiarism” includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining
                   by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source, including words, ideas,
                   illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting that material as
                   one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program course requirement
                   (from Sec. 11-402,
                   http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-conduct/
                   ).
Copyright and      Understanding the basic principles of copyright and fair use is of critical importance to designers. Many
Fair Use           of the uses we will make of texts, images, and videos this semester will be covered by the doctrine of fair
                   use. However, as creators, you need to be aware of your own and other copyright holders’ legal rights,
                   and to properly identify and license your own and others’ works. We will discuss these issues during the
                   semester as needed, but when you have questions about whether or when you can appropriate
                   someone else’s work, a useful resource is Georgia K. Harper’s Copyright Crash Course, available at

Campus Carry       The concealed carry of handguns by permit holders is generally allowed in outdoor areas, as well as
                   buildings and spaces that are accessible to the public. Permit holders are allowed to carry in classrooms.
                   It is the responsibility of concealed-carry license holders to carry their handguns on or about their person
                   at all times while on campus. “About” the person means that a license holder may carry a holstered
                   handgun in a backpack or handbag, but the backpack or handbag must be close enough that the license
                   holder can grasp it without materially changing position. The holster must completely cover the trigger
                   area and have enough tension to keep the gun in place if jostled. A license holder may not carry a
                   partially or wholly visible handgun on campus premises or on any university driveway, street, sidewalk or
                   walkway, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking area.
                   The open carry of handguns is not permitted on campus. Anyone who sees an openly carried gun on
                   campus should immediately call 911. (from https://campuscarry.utexas.edu/students)
Course Schedule    The course schedule may be adjusted to accommodate UT closures, instructor illness, student
                   needs/interests, and other opportunities. Any significant alterations to the schedule will be announced
                   in class and on Canvas.
                   In general, the course will follow a regular weekly schedule - assignments intro and demo on Tuesdays,
                   lab time on Thursdays. Unless otherwise noted, all assignments are due at the beginning of class on
                   Tuesdays.
