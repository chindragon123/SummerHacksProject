                                  Rebels and Rejects: Rethinking the 1950s
        Focusing on the first two decades after the end of WWII—the “long 1950s”—this seminar
course examines how the context of the cold war influenced American culture and politics, particularly
with regard to race, gender, and sexuality. In many ways, cold war paranoia about the communist threat
prohibited political dissent, but it also indirectly inspired or created limited opportunities for civil rights
struggles for people of color, women, and gays and lesbians. Similarly, despite the postwar emphasis on
social and cultural conformity, this era witnessed the development of influential subcultural
communities and dramatic cultural innovations with regard to literature, art, and music. This course thus
uncovers the roots of the radical liberation movements and social and cultural transformations that
emerged with full force in the 1960s. We will examine issues including the early civil rights movement
in Mississippi, Asian Americans’ battles against housing discrimination in California, the development
of gay and lesbian urban bar cultures, the suburban nuclear family ideal and those bachelors, Beatniks,
working women and delinquent teens who defied it.
Goals:
• To introduce you to a range of methods and materials that have been used to study American
politics, culture, and society in the 1950s.
• To learn how to identify and critique scholarly arguments.
• To learn how to build your own arguments.
• To learn how to conduct archival research and analyze primary source materials.
Major Questions:
• How did social, cultural, and political transformations of the postwar era lay the groundwork for the
dramatic transformations of the 1960s?
• What is the relationship between political radicalism and social and cultural rebellion?
• In what ways did Americans in the postwar era challenge, question, or diverge from mainstream
        norms?
• What motivated some Americans to political action, cultural innovation, or social dissent in this era?
• What connections exist between the postwar period and our own historical moment?
Required Texts:
Jack Kerouac, On the Road (New York: Viking, 1957)
Hettie Jones, How I Became Hettie Jones (New York: Grove Press, 1990).
        *The co-op has ordered used copies of this book, you may also find them online.
Assignments:
Reading Responses
Students will be required to complete 4 reading responses of around 500 words (1.5 to 2 double-spaced
pages). These response papers should be turned in to the correct discussion folder by 10 am the day of
class. Each response should reflect on the readings to be discussed that day. While these responses are


an opportunity for you to reflect on the materials and share your thoughts and opinions, they must also
answer the following questions: Who are the authors? What do they argue? What evidence does they
use? After answering these questions you may then provide your personal response to the material.
To ensure that students are not all writing responses on the same days, Group 1 will respond to Monday
readings, Group 2 will respond to Wednesday readings, and Group 3 will respond to Friday readings.
Students will be assigned groups on the first day of class.
Participation
Active participation is essential to this course. Missing more than 3 classes will affect your final grade.
Participation requires more than simply showing up to class. You must complete the readings in advance
and come to class prepared to actively contribute to discussion. If you do miss a class please contact one
of your peers to find out what you missed.
Midterm Paper
For this assignment you will be required to complete one short 5-7 page paper due October 14th. The
questions for the midterm will be given at least one week ahead of time.
Final Paper and Presentation
For this assignment you will be required to complete one 10-12 page paper on a “rebel” or “reject” of
your choice. You will have to use at least two primary sources, two secondary sources (not from course
syllabus), as well as two in-class readings. A paper proposal/annotated bibliography will be due
November 4th. A rough draft will be due November 18. The final draft will be due December 14th.
You will also prepare a 10 minute presentation on your final paper to present to the class during the final
week.
You are encouraged, but not required to select an individual to write about who has an archival
collection on campus, either at the Briscoe Center for American History or the Harry Ransom Center.
You might also want to begin thinking about who you want to write about fairly early in the semester. If
you do not choose to write about an individual with primary materials on campus, please talk with me
about other ways to locate primary materials online or in other ways.
Here is an initial list of individuals to consider:
Briscoe Center

Saul Alinksy – community organizer
C. Wright Mills - sociologist
Ransom Center
Mary McCarthy – novelist

Carson McCullers – novelist
Allen Ginsberg – Beat writer
Neal Cassady – Beat writer
Carol Bergé – Beat writer

Additional Notes/Requirements

I reserve the right to create additional in-class assignments that will count towards your participation
grade.
Plus/minus grades will be used in this course.
All students are required to visit me once during office hours. You cannot earn an A in this course if you
do not come to office hours at least once.
Late assignments may be docked 5 points each day they are late. If you believe you will require an
extension you must contact me at least 24 hours in advance.
