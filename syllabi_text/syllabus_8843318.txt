MEMORANDUM FOR AS 100 STUDENTS
FROM: Capt Thom Hart
SUBJECT: Welcome to AS100/Foundations of the United States Air Force
 1. Welcome to Air and Space Studies 100; The Foundation of the United States Air Force.
 This two-term course is designed as an introduction to the Air Force Reserve Officers Training
 Corps (AFROTC) and the Air Force (AF). It will allow college students like yourselves to “try
 out” our program so you can see for yourself if the Air Force is the right fit for you. By just
 taking this course you ARE NOT committing to the Air Force. That particular decision is in
 the future, if you are qualified and that is what you decide to do.
 2. The topics we will cover this term include the history and heritage of the greatest Air Force
 in the world, the Air Force’s mission, organization and combat capabilities, the amazing career
 opportunities coupled with the outstanding benefits, and some customs, courtesies and standards.
 You will begin to practice your communications skills through briefings and in writing. Most of
 these topics are a basic introduction to the Air Force and the military.
 3. Some of you have had Junior ROTC or Civil Air Patrol experiences, grew up in military
 families, or have already served on active duty. As a result, you have already been exposed
 to some of the topics we will discuss. Let that work in your favor; use your experience to
 help others. For the vast majority of you who do not have a military background, this will
 be a true learning experience; you are all starting on an equal footing. We are all here to
 help and learn from each other.
 4. Good luck as you prepare to take this important step in your Air Force career, a career
 of service to our great nation!
                 Integrity First – Service before Self – Excellence in All We Do!
                                                                  // signed //

Course Description: The fall semester of AS 100, “Foundations of the United States Air
Force”, establishes foundations for future development. It emphasizes critical skills required of
Air Force Officers, to include: listening skills, principles of war, policy and strategy, Air Force
Values, human relations, and leadership requirements. This is a one (1) credit-hour course and
requires critical thinking and understanding of materials presented.
Course Objectives: Cadets will be exposed to more background about the Air Force and its
operations, to include soft skills. Cadets should comprehend the material taught, and be able to
think about the implications of the information gleaned, along with how they will use those tools
in the future, and how Air Force Officers can improve upon those tools. Cadets will also be
required to learn core information about the Air Force and recall that information as reference
points in the future.
NOTE: Lesson Objectives are included with reading/lesson materials and are posted in Canvas.
                                         Attendance Policy
AFROTC Attendance Policy (AFROTCI 36-2011, 9.10.1): Cadets and non-cadets who are
participating students in this class must achieve a minimum of 80 percent attendance over the
course of the term to receive a passing final grade. Treat class as a military appointment. If you
will be late or unable to attend, make every effort to coordinate this with the instructor before
class. Examples of excusable absences are: Family emergency, conflicting appointments (i.e. -
Air Force physical), and events beyond your control. Examples of unexcused absences are:
                               This syllabus is subject to change                                   3


Studying for a test, sleeping in, etc. Make-up work may be allowed for excused absence at the
discretion of the instructor.
When you must miss class for valid, unavoidable reasons, notify your instructor as soon as
possible but no later than before class start time. In case of unexpected circumstances (i.e.,
emergencies), you should notify me no later than 24 hours after class session. Alternate
requirements or makeup activities will be arranged for the valid, unavoidable criteria listed
below:
               Participation in an approved field trip or other official University activity (e.g.,
                athletics, debate, music, theater arts, AFROTC physical). Note: Fraternity and/or
                sorority functions are not official University activities; or
               Sickness or medical confinement…must provide documentation (missing class
                because you have a headache from studying late the night before is an unexcused
                absence); or
               An emergency (e.g., death in the family, automobile accident).
        ****Administrative Requirement: Regardless of circumstance, if you miss class, email
        course instructor within 24 hours about the absence (with ABSENT as your subject line).
        Any unexcused absence will result in a 2% reduction of your overall class grade.
Academic only (non-cadet) students are not required to meet the 80 percent requirement, but
are strongly encouraged to attend all scheduled classes.
                              Student Responsibilities and Guidelines
Classroom Conduct:
       When a ranking officer/instructor enters the classroom, students will stand and come to
        attention until told to be seated by the officer. When the officer prepares to leave the
        classroom, the students must again come to attention until dismissed or until the officer
        leaves the classroom. Class members will select a class monitor and alternate who will
        make these announcements for all class sessions.
       Students are not required to stand or raise your hand when contributing to class
        discussions, but you must be respectful of others at all times. You will properly address
        the instructor as sir/ma’am or by rank (e.g., Captain, Major, and Colonel) and address
        NCOs as sergeant.
                                This syllabus is subject to change                                   4


      No, smoking, or use of other tobacco products while in class (tobacco use of any kind is
       prohibited on the UT campus). Drinks are allowed; however, no open lid containers.
      Cell phones will be used to support class discussion and use of Kahoot.
      Use of laptops/tablets is only permitted for note taking and research to support class
       discussion.
Cadet Standards: Cadets must be aware of membership requirements (refer to AFROTCI 36-
2011). Here’s a recap of your requirements (these are not all-inclusive):
      Report all negative civil, military, or school involvements to the detachment within 72
       hours. If the incident occurs during a school break lasting longer than 72 hours, cadets
       may wait to report the involvement NLT 72 hours after their return to classes following
       the break.
      Maintain a full academic load of 12.0 credit hours (exceptions for final semester) and
       term and cumulative GPA of 2.00 or greater. You must also pass all AS courses with a C
       or better and no F or incomplete grades in any of your classes. For scholarship cadets, If
       term and cumulative GPA of 2.50 or greater is not maintained, a Conditional Event will
       be issued.
      Remain in good standing at your institution.
      Discuss plans to drop classes or change majors with cadre in advance.
      Meet physical fitness and weight standards.
      Meet medical standards and advise us of any changes in your status.
      Maintain Air Force standards of appearance, leadership, self-discipline, and behavior.
      Saluting/Reporting: When in uniform, render a hand salute and verbal greeting to all
       military officers outside, and when reporting in (whether or not in uniform). Salute all
       ranking cadet officers, of all military services, when in uniform. Unless told to enter at
       ease, you must use proper reporting procedures when entering the office of a
       commissioned officer.
      Uniform Wear: Wear your uniform properly and proudly! You must maintain grooming
       and weight standards to wear the uniform. Note: AFI 36-2903 requires that dress and
       appearance standards are followed on- and off-duty.
                              This syllabus is subject to change                                  5


       Civilian Clothes/Uniform: In accordance with AFROTCI 36-2008 cadets will wear their
        uniform for at least one full day per school week, during their attendance at LLAB, and
        for Practical Military Training (PMT). If not in military uniform, all cadets will wear
        appropriate civilian attire to their AS class. At all times, appropriate uniform or civilian
        clothes will be worn will be worn in CLA. NO HATS will be worn in the buildings at any
        time.
       Hazing: Hazing is neither honorable nor respectful behavior. Hazing is inconsistent with
        military order. Do not use your cadet position or rank to take advantage of, or inflict
        cruelty on subordinates, to include indignity, oppression, or deprivation of any right or
        privilege to which they are legally entitled. Be honorable, be respectful.
       Drugs & Alcohol: No drugs, period. No drinking alcohol unless you are of legal age. Be
        responsible—do not abuse alcohol and never drive while or after drinking.
                                            Administration

anything else, don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment with me. Please use Calendly to do so at
https://calendly.com/thomas-hart/office-visit. The link will also be posted on Canvas.
Academic Integrity: Integrity is an Air Force core value. Plagiarism and cheating are just a
couple examples of behavior that show a lack of integrity. These and other examples will not be
                               This syllabus is subject to change                                    6

to obey rules of honest scholarship, and so do students. Additionally, the core values of the
University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold these
values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community. For

Class Participation & On-Time Attendance: Class participation and on-time attendance are
worth 10 points or 10% of your grade. I expect all students to be in-place at the beginning of the
class period. Two (2) minutes late is considered tardy; any/all tarries will be considered when
determining this portion of your grade -- any unexcused absence will result in a 2% reduction of
your overall class grade. Additionally, I expect active participation from all students during
every class period. Active participation is essential to your individual development as a
student…and specifically in this course that is preparing you for your transition into the Active
Air Force. Prior preparation and attentiveness during class are keys to maximizing your
participation credit.
Examinations: There are two examinations, each worth 30 points or 30% of your grade. These
tests may be a combination of short answer, multiple choice, and True/False questions. The
material for the examinations is selected from class discussions and presentations (to include
student presentations), student readings, supplemental readings, guest speakers, and videos.
The Exam #1 will cover material from the first half of the course. The Exam #2 will cover
material from the second half of the course.
Writing Assignments: There are two writing assignments. Follow the general writing
assignment guidelines below as well as unique requirements for each individual assignment.
General Guidelines:
     All assignments are due not later than the start of class period they are due.
     Students must hand in a hard-copy & submit an electronic copy of all written
        assignments. Electronic copies will be submitted via e-mail with the following subject
        line: “AS 100 – Cadet XXXXX – Title of Assignment”
     All references will be integrated and appropriated cited within the flow of your paper.
     Grading: I will consider three main areas in grading your work: grammar and format;
        justification/clarity/conciseness; and effectiveness in meeting the tasking.
Writing Assignment # 1 – This is a two-page official memorandum covering why you are in
AFROTC and why you want to be an officer in the Air Force. Be sure to include specifically
how you heard about Det 825 at UT; what you hope to gain through the program as well as
strengths you bring to cadet wing. Use the Tongue and Quill format pages 183-185 to assist you.
The memorandum is worth 10 points which is 10% of your grade. This assignment is due on 25
Oct.
Below list of ‘ideas/sources’ is not all inclusive; it is simply provided to highlight some
sources/topics you may address in your background paper. The more thought and effort you put
into this assignment, the more valuable the result!
   Military OneSource (http://www.militaryonesource.mil/): Moving is one of life’s top 4 most stressful
    events. As an Air Force officer, you need to become comfortable and efficient at this to
    reduce the stress on you and your family. Just as important, you need to understand this the
    challenges inherent with this difficult process and the tools available to assist with a military
    move so you can HELP YOUR AIRMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES when they encounter
                                This syllabus is subject to change                                     8


    difficulties! When you think about planning a military move, you may find the “Military
    Life Topics, Moving Tab” a useful planning link.
   Your Future, or Anticipated Future … Airman & Family Readiness Center (A&FRC): The
    A&FRC is designed as a one-stop information and referral center for single, married, active
    duty military and retired individuals and their families. From finding on/off base resources
    for everything from child care and financial management to housing & school referrals,
    spouse employment assistance programs, fitness, recreation, and a free household item loan
    lockers when you or your Airmen find yourself without pots/pans, alarm clocks & child
    booster seats. This is only a short list of programs offered or supported by your installation’s
    A&RFC. Simply put, the A&FRC can and will gladly help with your transition. I’ll be
    bold to say all installations have great web A&FRC web pages and awesome – friendly –
    helpful on-site staffs!
   Active Duty Pay and Benefits: Personal Finance & Budget on Second Lieutenant Pay
         o Prepare a Month budget using an Excel spreadsheet to show the following
                  Base Gross Pay as a 2LT
                  Calculate Net Pay at 25% tax rate
                  BAH entitlement as a 2LT (BAH Calculator: Defense Travel Management
                     Office: http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/bah.cfm
                  Show a detailed list of liabilities with estimates (food, rent,
                     electricity/water/internet/phone bills, car payment/insurance, etc.)
                          Provide comments detailing how estimates were calculated
                  Show a final balance for the month. What is left for fun, investments, travel,
                     etc.?
   Active Duty Personnel – Real Life Lessons Learned: Experience is priceless. Where better
    to learn about what to anticipate and what to expect … things you might not expect with your
    first Air Force move.
Briefing Assignment: You will brief each of your writing assignment topic. Each briefing is
worth 10 points or 10% of your grade. The presentation will last 5 minutes (+/- 1 min). This
will be an information briefing intended to educate the audience. Powerpoint presentation is
optional. The briefing will be presented in accordance with this syllabus schedule (See course
outline for due dates).
         General Guidelines:
             Your specific briefing topic will be assigned in class. Reminder, you will present
                 either Official Duties, or Transition to First Assignment (not both).
             Arrive early and ensure the presentation works properly.
             PowerPoint optional for this presentation/briefing.
             Grading: I may use the HOLMCENTER Form 6 - Informative Briefing Grading
                 Sheet – to grade the briefing.
