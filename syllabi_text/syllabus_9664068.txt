Description: The second half of the nineteenth-century saw unprecedented changes in the social and political history of
the United States. At the moment the U.S. realized a “national literature,” a fierce internecine struggle forced a redefinition
of American nationality, citizenship, and culture. This course, which surveys the literature of the years 1865 to the present,
begins with war and ends with the emergence of a recognizably “postmodern America.” Along the way, we’ll examine
themes of race, class, gender, and sexuality; consider the relationship of violence to justice; and study the effects of
industrialization, globalization, and immigration. Our readings will draw on both canonical and understudied authors. Above
all else, the course will emphasize the diverse and contingent nature of late-nineteenth, twentieth-, and twenty-first
century American literature. This course will: offer a survey American literature between the end of the Civil War and the
contemporary moment; model methods of literary and cultural interpretation; help students to improve their critical
thinking and reading skills.
Texts: Readings will be drawn from the Norton Anthology of American Literature, Shorter Ninth Edition, Volume 2 (Norton;
ISBN: 978-0393264531). All texts available at the Co-Op, 2246 Guadalupe; additional materials are available via Canvas (C).
Requirements & Grading:
Examinations (70% of final grade)
There will be two examinations during the summer session, each worth 35% of the final grade in the course. These
examinations will be conducted in-class and involve a series of interpretive identifications. More information on the
examinations will follow shortly.
Reading Quizzes (15% of final grade)
In addition to the examinations, student preparation and reading comprehension will be evaluated via brief, 15-point
reading quizzes. Quizzes will occur at the beginning of class and include three questions. There will be a minimum of two
reading quizzes per week; quiz days will not be announced in advance. The quizzes are intended to reward students who
complete the reading assignments on time and with care. (In other words, you get credit for what you should be doing
anyway.) Students will be allowed to drop their two lowest quizzes; missed quizzes cannot be made up.
Participation (15% of final grade)
Students are expected to be active participants in all class discussions and activities. Contributions to discussions will be
measured by, among other things, quality of insights, familiarity with the material, responsiveness to the ideas and
comments of classmates, and willingness to take intellectual risks. Attendance is mandatory; more than two absences will
adversely affect your participation grade.
Grading Rubric
Letter grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric:
A = 940-1000                                     B- = 800-839                                   D+ = 670-699
A- = 900-939                                     C+ = 770-799                                   D = 640-669
B+ = 870-899                                     C = 740-769                                    D- = 600-639
B = 840-869                                      C- = 700-739                                   F = 0-599

A Note on Reading for and Discussion in this Course
Surveys of American literature are, by their nature, partial and idiosyncratic. There is simply no way to represent in a single term the
full diversity of the literatures (plural) produced in the United States during the past 154 years. (This is especially true during a short
summer session.) You will be asked to read a great deal of material this semester. It will not be possible for us to discuss all of that
material in class. However, you will be responsible for all the material that appears on this syllabus. Also, studying literature often
requires us to engage with uncomfortable and even offensive content. In this course we will address such content in a forthright and
mature fashion, using our critical thinking, reading, and writing skills to both critique and contextualize it. At the same time, respect
for the course community and one another’s experiences and viewpoints is paramount.
