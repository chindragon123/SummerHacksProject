Technological Requirements
         All students will be required to use excel and SPSS throughout the semester.
Course Goals
From a media and advertising perspective, this course will cover both quantitative and qualitative
methodologies. Quantitatively, this class will cover survey, experimental, and content analysis methods.
Within these quantitative perspectives, this course will also focus on survey design and question
development. Qualitatively, in-depth interview, focus group, and observational techniques will also be
discussed. Finally, all students should be comfortable “working” with data by the end of the semester.
Grading breakdown is as follows:
Self and Digital Interview                                 =      15%
Hypotheses Paper                                           =      10%
Individual Data Write-ups Assignment (x2)                  =      30%
Final- Analysis Presentation                               =      15%
Final Analysis Write-up                                    =      30%
Total                                                             100%


Grade Breakdown
 93-100 = A      87-89 = B+        77-79 = C+           65-69 = D+
                                                                          59 and below = F
 90-92 = A -     83-86 = B         73-76 = C            60-64 = D

Individual Assignments
Assignments will require you to manipulate and present data.
Canvas
In this class I use Canvas—a Web-based course management system with password-protected
access at http://courses.utexas.edu —to distribute course materials, to communicate and
collaborate online, to post grades, to submit assignments, and to give you online quizzes and
surveys. You can find supports in using Canvas at the ITS Help Desk at 475-9400, Monday
through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., so plan accordingly.
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code. [See
the UT Honor Code above.] Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic
credit will be the student's own work.
You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture
and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting"
help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one
student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of
an e mail, an e mail attachment file, a diskette, or a hard copy.
Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student
who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty
for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University
disciplinary action.
During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during
the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way.
Any collaborative behavior during the examinations will result in failure of the exam, and may
lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.


Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence to Students
All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student notification
policy. It is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or
her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in
order to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain
communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a
minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your e-
mail address are available at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html.
Documented Disability Statement
Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone).
Faculty is not required to provide accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.
     §   Please notify me as quickly as possible if the material being presented in class is not accessible
         (e.g., instructional videos need captioning, course packets are not readable for proper
         alternative text conversion, etc.).
     §   Please notify me as early in the semester as possible if disability-related accommodations for
         field trips are required. Advanced notice will permit the arrangement of accommodations on
         the given day (e.g., transportation, site accessibility, etc.).
     §   Contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video
         phone) or reference SSD’s website for more disability-related information:
         http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/for_cstudents.php
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
 If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice
 Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided
 through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health
 Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police
 Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Religious Holiday
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date
of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a
project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed
work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Emergency Evacuation
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a


fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding
evacuation:
     •   Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that
         the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
     •   If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
     •   In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin
Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office
Tentative Nature of Syllabus
I reserve the right to change and/or add readings throughout the semester. As you should notice, some
readings are still to be announced. These will be provided at least one week in advance.
