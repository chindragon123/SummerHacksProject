Textbook: Advertising and Integrated Brand Promotion, 8h Edition, O’Guinn, Thomas C., Chris
T. Allen, Angeline Close Scheinbaum, Richard J. Semenik, (Cengage Publishing, 2019)
Course Description:
         This course is designed as a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of
advertising and integrated brand promotion. The role of these persuasive communication tools within the
total marketing effort is studied. Advertising and IBP are presented and examined as (1) an element in our
social system; (2) a business process; (3) an art and communication form; and, (4) a science. The material
presented in class will supplement our textbook.
         ADV 318J will primarily be a live-lecture based course supplemented by online lecture content
through Canvas. These online materials will be available through a streaming media server which requires
a broadband (high speed) Internet connection. The WIFI network on campus is sufficient and there are
many computer labs on campus. If you do not have your own computer, or if you do not have a fast,
broadband connection, you can use these options.
Student Responsibilities:
         •Complete assigned readings prior to the lecture for which they are listed.
         •Check your email / Canvas messenger daily.
         •Examinations test conceptual understanding of lectures and the text. To do well on the
         exams -- study your lecture notes and assigned readings. You are responsible for all
         material assigned for each exam.
         •You should develop an awareness of the trends and issues concerning advertising and
         public relations through the weekly reading of Advertising Age, PR Week and AdWeek.
         You should also become especially aware of current advertising/pr methods and practices
         by observing and critically evaluating ads and promotions you see and hear everyday.
Grading Rules:
         •Assignments must be in on time. If work is late, a grade of "0" will be assessed. All
         assignments must be submitted via Canvas in PDF format.
         •No make-up exams or assignments.
         •Any questions about a grade must be discussed within one week after the grade is
         posted.


Method of Evaluation
           Overall letter grades are based on point totals calculated by adding: (1) four exams (225 points
each) and (2) two projects (100 points total). Course grades are based on each student’s total out of the
1,000 points available. The points necessary to earn a letter grade are as follows:
                                   A=910, A-=870-909.9, B+=850-869.9, B=795-849.9
      C+=766.7-794.9, C=733.4-766.6, C-=695-733.3, D+=666.7-694.9, D=633.4-666.6, D-=595-633.3,
                                                              F=<595.
            The final exam is optional. You may choose to take the comprehensive final exam (worth 225
points). If the final exam score is higher than the lowest exam score, it will be substituted in place of the
exam score. There are no extra credit assignments, redoing projects or exams -- the only way to earn a
grade is by doing well on the exams and projects. You should check Canvas to confirm your grades on
exams, and projects are recorded correctly. Report any errors immediately.
 NOTE: Students must earn at least a B in this class to apply or continue as an advertising/PR major.
Exam Policy
           There will be four exams during the semester and an optional final scheduled during the University
final exam period. Exams consist of 40 multiple choice and true/false questions and given in the
classroom on exam days. If you miss an exam during the semester for any reason whatsoever, you must
take the comprehensive final exam. There are no other make-up exams.
Individual Projects
           Grades on the two individual projects have a significant impact on your final course grade. The
TA will grade these projects. Note that although you are encouraged to discuss projects with others in
class, you may only turn in your own, original work.
           If you have a question about your grade on a project, you must contact your TA immediately.
Project grades will be discussed only during the week immediately following their posting.
After that, grade changes will not be discussed -- no exceptions.
           Finally, following instructions is an important part of responding to these projects and no late
assignments will be accepted for any reason -- projects are due at 11:00 AM and may be submitted early.
The ability to meet deadlines and attend to details is an important part of the advertising and public relations
business.
