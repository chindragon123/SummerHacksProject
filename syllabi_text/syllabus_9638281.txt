COURSE OVERVIEW
This course is an introduction to American government and politics. While our main focus is on the
national level, additional attention is paid to the state and local governments of Texas. In some instances,
the American case is placed in a comparative context derived from the experience of other western
democratic nations. In other instances, we focus on changes over time within the American political
system to demonstrate how principles often change with context. At all times, we are interested in a better
understanding of how this particular system has developed and what it means for citizens of the United
States.
There are three primary objectives in this course. The first is to provide basic descriptive information
about the American and Texas political systems by examining important political processes, institutions,
and actors. The second is to develop analytical skills with which to understand complex relationships and
phenomena. The third is to introduce the work of the political scientist by concentrating on the paradigms
and techniques of the discipline.
The course is delivered completely online, which gives students more latitude in completing their
work, though the class is NOT entirely self-paced. The course meets online through Canvas. The course
material is organized by topic (“Modules”), and each module includes reading assignments, lecture and
guest-speaker videos, a segment keyed to recent events in politics, and a variety of assignments. Students
                                                                                                             1


will be expected to complete about 3 modules per week. The course schedule below contains module
assignments and due dates.
This design allows students to complete the work within one week according to their own schedule – as
long as the due dates for completion of each module lesson are met. Students are encouraged to visit
http://www.laits.utexas.edu/tower/tech.html to test their computer and network connection.
NOTE: It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a secure and reliable internet connection and are
using a device that can access the course lectures, materials, and exams (technical requirements are
spelled out below).
ONLINE EXAMS
This course will have three, non-cumulative midterm exams. The exams will be taken online, in Canvas,
and proctored by a testing company, ProctorU, in a virtual face-to-face setting. This means you will be
connected with a live person from one of their proctoring centers from the time you start the test until you
submit it. You can take the exam from almost anywhere using a webcam, a microphone, and a high-speed
Internet connection, as long as it is in a quiet, secure, and distraction-free setting (i.e. the kind of place you
should want to take an exam). ProctorU will confirm your identity and monitor your computer and work
space while you are taking the exam. ProctorU is a student-pay service.
In order to take the exams, students will need to create an account with ProctorU (a link will be provided
on the course Canvas page). Once students have created a ProctorU account, they will need to schedule and
pay for all three exam proctoring sessions. Instructions for creating an account and scheduling exam
sessions are included in the Pre-class Module 0.
It is required that you schedule and pay for all three exam proctoring sessions by 5:00 PM on July 18. You
will not be able to access Module 2 of the course content until you schedule and pay for all three exam
sessions.
WARNING! Late registrations are subject to availability. You may receive a zero credit for an exam
if you are unable to take a test on the required date because you did not make an appointment
before the due date of July 18.
COURSE COMMUNICATION and INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT
     •   Announcements: Outside of the video lectures, any student communication initiated by instructors
         and teaching assistants will be conducted via the Announcements page on our course website, so
         please make sure to check the Announcements page daily.
     •   Outside-of-Class Communication: Students who wish to contact anyone on the teaching team
         (instructors or teaching assistants) can do so either in person during office hours or via the

payment transferred to this course by emailing Soomo Learning's Student Support at
support@soomolearning.com. Please provide the course information from your previous course.
As mentioned above, you must also purchase three exam sessions through ProctorU. If you make
reservations before our prescribed July 18 deadline, the proctoring fee will be $19.75 per exam ($59.25
total).
If you purchase the required materials by the July 18 deadline, the total cost for course materials is either
$114.25 (if you buy through Canvas) or $132.60 (if the passkey is purchased through the Co-Op). If you
have any questions or issues associated with paying for the course materials, please contact us as soon as
possible.

ASSIGNMENTS and COURSE EVALUATION
The assignments and their sequencing are designed to actively engage students’ interaction with the on -
demand online format. There will be three (3) online, virtually-proctored exams. In addition to the exams,
grades will be derived from short answer assignments aimed at reinforcing students’ knowledge base. The
readings, lectures, and short answer assignments are all designed to prepare you for the exams. There
should be no surprises and you should do well if you do the readings, watch the videos, take notes,
complete all short answer assignments, and pay attention to where you may need to allocate resources to
studying.
The following groups of assignments will constitute the graded work of the course. Final grades will be
calculated based on the total number of points earned.
 Grading                          Points       Grading Rule
 Short Answer assignments         50           15 short answer assignments (one per module) @ 5

 questions
 Exams                            150          3 exams @ 50 points each
 Total Points                     300
     •  Short Answer assignments (15) – 5 points each [50 points total]. The highest ten (10) grades
        will be counted. Students will complete fifteen (15) short answer assignments (one per module)
        that develop applied understanding of the material presented by asking you to synthesize the
        material and make connections between and among concepts presented in each module. You will
        be graded on organization, spelling, and proper grammar. Your grade will also depend on the
        accuracy, thoughtfulness, and the details you include to support your answer and demonstrate
        (i.e., provide evidence) that you have read, understood, and can apply the course material
        presented in each module. Short Answer assignments for each module must be submitted by
        5:00 pm CDT on the due date. No exceptions.
     •  “In the News" Exercises (5) – 10 points each [50 points total]. Students will complete five (5)
        short answer assignments that develop applied understanding of the material presented in weekly
        “In the News” segments. Students will receive an announcement when the “In the News” video and
        assignment are available in Canvas, with a link to the video. Students will have 3-4 days to
        complete the assignment once it has been published. The “In the News” module will be located
        separately, at the top of the modules page. The same grading guidelines apply as outlined in the
                                                                                                          4


        Short Answer assignments above. Each assignment must be submitted by 5:00 pm CDT on the
        due date. No exceptions.
     •  Webtext “Get the Gist” Questions (13) – 5 points each [maximum 50 points total]. The highest
        ten (10) grades will be counted. The webtext will offer study questions that students will be asked
        to complete as you read the text. Each chapter will be worth 5 points, with your top 10 chapter
        scores contributing to your point total for this element of the course. You must answer these “Get
        the Gist” questions correctly to receive credit. You may reset the answers to all the questions on a
        page if you answer any of them incorrectly, but you will only have 3 total attempts to answer each
        set of questions correctly. A numerical score based on the percentage of total questions answered
        correctly will constitute your Texas Politics reading grade. Each assignment must be submitted
        by 5:00 pm CDT on the due date. No exceptions.
     •  Midterm Exams (3) - 50 points each [150 points total]. Midterm Exams will be non-cumulative.
        Each of these computer-graded exams contains multiple-choice questions that cover material from
        both lecture and the Texas Politics textbook. They are designed to reinforce your understanding
        of the course material. Exams are 75 minutes and consist of 50 multiple choice questions. Exam
        One will cover the material from Modules 1-5; Exam Two will cover the material from Modules 6-
        10; Exam Three will cover the material from Modules 11-15.
If you have a university-defined and approved excuse (e.g., a medical or personal emergency) that prevents
you from taking the exam at the appointed time, please notify us immediately so we can consider an
alternative arrangement.
The grading scale is as follows:
  93%-100%          A                     77%-79%        C+                     67%-69%      D+

TITLE IX REPORTING
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment,
sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational
institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
     1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
     2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
          become involved in a Title IX investigation.
     3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory
Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX
Coordinator. We are Responsible Employees and must report any Title IX related incidents that are
disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with us, or with any faculty or staff member
about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to
speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university,
email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources,
visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
