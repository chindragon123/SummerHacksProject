Course Description:
         Throughout U.S. history, Americans have defined, questioned and reworked their sense
of national identity by traveling outside of the nation’s borders. From Audre Lorde to Anthony
Bourdain, this course will consider various Americans who have traveled abroad, looking at how
their voyages have been imagined, experienced and represented in literature and popular culture.
We will approach these figures and journeys from multiple perspectives, asking questions about
how international travel influences individuals as well as local, national and transnational
communities. A key goal of this course will be to consider the ways that Americans with
differing levels of privilege have approached international travel. We will question the ways that
gender, sexuality, race, class, age, ability and citizenship status shape not only which individuals
are easily able to leave the country, but also how those individuals experience travel. We will
consider tourism alongside other modes of travel, including travel on behalf of social causes, in
search of knowledge, or travel in service of governmental or corporate agendas. Themes that we
will return to throughout the course will be cosmopolitanism, transnationalism, consumerism,
mobility and identity. Ultimately, we will seek to understand travel—both real and imagined—as
a practice that can result in personal, community, national and transnational transformation.
Goals:
- To introduce you to a range of materials and methods that can be used to analyze American
history, culture, and politics.
- To gain an understanding of the role of travel in the formation of American identities, as well
as in the development of international perceptions of the U.S.
- To develop your ability to make arguments in writing.


                                                                                                   2
Assignments:
Attendance
Attendance in seminar is mandatory and crucial to your success in the class. You are permitted
three unexcused absences. After that, you will lose two points on your overall grade per
additional absence. Excused absences will be provided for religious holidays and university-
sponsored events only.
Participation
Your participation grade will be based on thoughtful contributions to class discussions and group
work, active listening, and intellectual engagement. In order to participate, you must complete
each day’s reading and bring the assigned text with you to class.
A Note on the Personal: I encourage you all to draw on personal experience during discussion
and in written work. Bringing in the personal, if relevant, can be an enriching experience for the
whole class. However, please be mindful of the privilege that international travel entails and be
sensitive to your peers who have not left or cannot leave the country. Sharing a travel anecdote
that connects to or complicates themes that we touch on in class is wonderful. Bragging about a
luxury vacation is not. Lastly, keep in mind that drawing on personal experience can take many
forms. If you have ever watched a travel TV show, fantasized about a dream vacation, or viewed
a friend’s travel photos on social media, you have valuable contributions to make to our
discussions.
Reading Responses
You are required to submit four reading responses throughout the semester on days of your
choosing. It is highly recommended that you space these out evenly throughout the semester,
rather than waiting until the very end. These responses should critically engage the day’s
assigned text, moving beyond a summary to think about the ways the reading adds to or
challenges our understanding of course themes and/or previous readings. These responses should
be at least two pages double-spaced, Times New Roman, 12-point font, with one-inch margins
and should be given to me in hard copy at the end of the class period.
Midterm Essay
For the midterm essay, you will analyze a primary source created by an American abroad.
Sources can be written texts or visual artifacts. Possible sources include travel narratives,
newspaper/magazine articles, ethnographies, documentaries, photos, paintings, journals and
letters. The essay should be four to five pages double-spaced, Times New Roman, 12-point font,
with one-inch margins, and should include a works cited page and a clear thesis. See Canvas
Assignment page for additional instructions. Due as a hard copy in class and as a Canvas
submission by Mar 6.


                                                                                                   3
After graded papers are returned, you will have the option to revise the essay for a higher grade.
Revisions will be due as a hard copy in class, together with your original paper with my
comments, and as a Canvas submission by April 6.
Final Paper Proposal
You should start thinking about your final paper as early as possible. To encourage this, I will
ask you to submit a paper proposal of 300-500 words outlining your proposed topic, potential
sources, and any questions or concerns that you have. I am always happy to meet during office
hours to help brainstorm protentional topics. This proposal should be sent to me as an email or as
a Canvas message no later than April 13 (midnight).
Final Essay
For the final paper, you will research and write about any American individual or group who
traveled/travels internationally, placing them in historical context and incorporating key themes
from the course. This project can build off of the midterm paper or be an entirely new subject. If
building off of the midterm paper, the final paper must include at least 75% new writing. (So, a
10-page essay could include up to 2.5 pages of writing drawn from your midterm essay; a 12-
page essay could include up to 3 pages of previous writing.) The essay should be 10- to 12-pages
double-spaced, Times New Roman, 12-point font, with one-inch margins, and should include a
works cited page and a clear thesis. See Canvas Assignment page for additional instructions
Final essay due as a Canvas submission by May 11, 2pm.
Final Presentation
During the last week of class, you will give a presentation of five minutes based on your final
paper research. These presentations will be done “pecha kucha”-style, meaning that you will
create a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation of ten slides, and you will have 30 seconds to
spend on each slide. It is highly recommended that you set the Powerpoint on a timer that will
automatically advance the slides every 30 seconds – please come see me if you need technical
assistance. There will be time for questions, and these presentations will give you the opportunity
not only to share your research with your peers, but also to receive feedback that might be
helpful as you complete your essay.
Lateness Policy
Showing up late will negatively influence your participation grade. Unless there is a valid
excuse, any student arriving 15 minutes after the start of class will be marked absent for that day.
Assignments turned in late will automatically lose ten points, followed by ten points per
additional day of lateness.

Additional Notes/Requirements:
Writing Flag
This course carries a Writing Flag. This means that you will be required to write regularly—
several times during the semester—and to complete writing projects that are substantial. It also
means that you will have substantial assigned reading, since reading other writers is one of the
best ways to improve your own writing.
Technology Policy
All cell phones must be off and stowed during class. You may only use a laptop or tablet for
taking notes or consulting the day’s readings. Any student seen using a laptop or phone for non-
class related purposes will have points deducted from their participation grade and may be asked
to leave the classroom.
Emotionally Difficult Material
This course will reference difficult topics, including enslavement, war, violence, racism,
emotional trauma, and misogyny. We will approach this material critically and thoughtfully,
looking at how certain events or sentiments are represented in American culture and asking why
it matters to study these difficult moments in history. I encourage you to take whatever
precautions and actions help you get through this material, whether that means stepping out of
class, skimming emotionally difficult sections of reading, or meeting with me to discuss other
accommodations.

programs and activities, and it encourages any student or non-student who thinks that he or she

Academic Honesty:
Plagiarism is the intentional or unintentional use of someone else’s words or ideas without
properly acknowledging them. I will report all instances of academic dishonesty to Student
Judicial Services and the Office of the Dean of Students. Please contact me if you have any
questions regarding the definition of plagiarism. You may also visit the Student Judicial Services

Plagiarism Detection Software
All assignments in this course may be processed by TurnItIn, a tool that compares submitted
material to an archived database of published work to check for potential plagiarism. Other
methods may also be used to determine if a paper is the student’s original work. Regardless of
the results of any TurnItIn submission, the faculty member will make the final determination as
to whether or not a paper has been plagiarized.
