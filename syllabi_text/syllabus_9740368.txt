                                      MEMORANDUM
To:     ADV318J students
From:   Gary B. Wilcox
Date:   October 28, 2019
RE:     Individual Project #3—Comparative Analysis, New brand name, Creative Brief,
        and Instagram Ad or Promoted Tweets
This memorandum describes your second major project which each of you must complete
individually. This project is worth 90 points and is to be submitted on Canvas– no later
than
11:00am – on Monday, November 20th. Late=0. You may turn in your paper early.
Individual project #2 is comprised of three parts. Your task is to (1) conduct a
comparative evaluation of the brand name and packaging of two existing brands of snack
chips and recommend a brand name for a new brand in this category, (2) write a Creative
Brief for the introduction of your new brand and (3) develop an Instagram ad OR
Promoted Tweets for the introduction of the new brand.
Part 1. Comparative Evaluation (30 pts)
• Select two existing brands in the snack chip category to analyze. Use the criteria
    identified on the attached “Brand name and Packaging Considerations” to organize
    your comparative analysis. Develop a concise discussion of each criterion in which
    you evaluate and contrast the two brands and indicate which brand performs best on
    each criterion plus which one does best overall in terms of (a) brand name and (b)
    packaging. As a conclusion of your analysis, you must develop an appropriate brand
    name for your new brand. This new brand is to be targeted to active consumers 18-30
    years of age. In presenting your recommendations: (a) discuss your brand name in
    terms of four brand name criteria; and (b) explain why your recommended brand
    name would be effective in presenting your brand at the point-of-sale in the store
    (here you should focus only on the “promotion” and “shape and design strategy”
    packaging criteria).
•   Part 2. Creative Brief (30 pts) The creative brief is a key strategic tool within the
    Integrated Brand Communication development process. It should include the
    following areas: Background/overview (a short summary of your comparative
    evaluation), a Creative Objective (goal of the IBP campaign), Target Audience,
    Creative Strategy (your Big Idea), and Benefits (reasons to believe, try or buy).
    According to Nick Worthington of BBDO, London, “A good Creative Brief sets the
    basis on which ideas can be sparked off – consciously or subconsciously. It
    immediately inspires everyone that comes in contact with it. In order to achieve this,
    the Creative Brief reduces the strategy to its essence. This reduction turns the small
    light of a torch into a kind of focused ‘laser beam’, from which many ideas can be
    sparked off’.
Part 3. Instagram ad OR Promoted Tweets (30 pts)


•    Instagram Ad – Develop an Instagram Square Image photo ad that is 1080 x 1080
     pixels in size that introduces your new brand name and package design. Your ad
     should execute the strategy stated in your creative brief.
•    Promoted Tweets – Develop three different tweets that deliver an engaging message
     about your new brand based on the creative brief you completed. Obviously, your
     messages should encourage engagement and retweeting activity among the audience.
•    All work must be your original ideas and completed without assistance from anyone.
YOUR RESPONSE – Convey your comparative evaluation in a concise, one page,
single-spaced typewritten communication (8 ½ x 11"). Use this memo and sample
assignments as a guide. Your second page should be your Creative Brief. Your ad or
Twitter posts should follow your first page and second pages and all three pages included
as one PDF file that can be uploaded to Canvas.
Note that the following guidelines apply to all major projects in the class.
     1. You may use a type size no smaller than 11 points and you may not reduce your
         paper.
     2. Organization, clear communication, spelling, grammar, neatness and so on will be
         considered in evaluating your work.
     3. Papers, which do not conform to the specifications indicated, and late papers will
         not be accepted for any reason. Late=0. If you are concerned about a computer
         problem, Canvas issues, etc. you should submit your assignment early.
     4. Project grades will be discussed only during the week immediately following their
         return. After that, grade changes will not be discussed – no exceptions.
     5. Remember the characteristics, which explain success in the advertising business –
         creativity, enthusiasm, and hard work and exercise them.
      “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did
       something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw
                      something. It seemed obvious to them after a while”
                                             Steve Jobs
     “Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative
                                              people”
                                            Leo Burnett
      “An important idea not communicated persuasively is like having no idea at all.”
                                           Bill Bernbach
    “When you make music or write or create, it's really your job to have mind-blowing,
 irresponsible, condomless sex with whatever idea it is you're writing about at the time.”
