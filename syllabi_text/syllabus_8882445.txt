Course Description:
        In the nineteenth century waves of immigrants from several Central and Northern
European countries altered the demographics of Texas significantly while accelerating both
economic and agricultural development of the republic and (later) state. Painted churches,
dance halls, sausage festivals, etc. still speak to the cultural legacy of these immigrants in
large swaths of Texas while, amazingly, pockets of bilingualism still survive after several
generations. The immigrant story often intertwined with larger themes of Texas history
such as frontier, Native Americans, and slavery. Contrasting attitudes and values led to
conflict at times, especially during the Civil War, since many of the immigrants openly
opposed secession and/or slavery.
        This course will examine both the push—the causes of European emigration—and
the pull—the attraction of Texas as a destination. The goal is to further our understanding
of the cultural and social forces at play in the nineteenth century on both sides of the
Atlantic and to deepen our appreciation for the positive contributions of the many different
European nationalities that have added strands to the rich and colorful tapestry of the state.
        Readings for classroom discussion will all come from online sources, either posted
on my website or available through the Handbook of Texas online. It will not be necessary
to purchase any books.
        We will tour the Briscoe Center for American History Studies, the Texas State
Library, and the General Land Office, all located in Austin and all-important repositories of
primary and secondary source information. Students will do a mini-research paper and
short presentation based on research in one or all of these facilities. This is a process as
opposed to product-oriented class. In other words, for the final project, the doing is more
important than what gets done.
Course Objectives:
There are several specific goals for this course.
    •   Discuss the social and political forces in Central Europe that drove millions to
        consider emigration to the New World.
    •   Explain the appeal of Texas as a destination
    •   Understand the nuts and bolts of immigration in the nineteenth century
    •   Know the contributions of the various ethnic groups to the economic, social, and
        cultural development of the republic (and later state)
    •   Explain how the theme of European immigration intersected with other major
        themes of Texas history, such as frontier, Native Americans, role of women, and
        slavery.
    •   Become familiar with the resources that are available for further scholarly work
Course Requirements:
    • to come to class,
    • to do the readings, and
    • to participate in the scheduled visits to the Briscoe Center for American History
        Studies, the Texas State Library, and the General Land Office. All facilities are within
        walking distance of the University.
    • to complete projects/paper on time and according to proscribed format.

The readings, although numerous, are usually quite short, often less than a page. They will
provide the background information vital to achieving the goals outlined above, as well as to
provide you with a framework for class discussions and for your research project. There
will be short quizzes at the beginning of most classes over the assigned reading. A list of
questions from which the quizes will come will be provided in Canvas. All assignments,
tests, and readings will be posted in Canvas.
