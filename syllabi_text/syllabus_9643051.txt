Course Description
UT’s New York City summer course, “The Global City,” will give students the opportunity to explore New
York City’s historic neighborhoods, landmarks, museums and attend a range of cultural and political
events. The city itself is the classroom. This course reveals how America’s largest metropolis has been
transnational since its very inception: from the conquest of indigenous land, to the city’s involvement in
the US slave trade and plantation economy, to its central role in the industrial revolution, to its status as a
destination point for migrants from around the world and, finally, to its emergence as the preeminent
center of world finance. This course literally traces New York City’s history through first-hand visits to
major landmarks and historic neighborhoods including African burial grounds, ports, factories, tenements,
Harlem, el Barrio, Chinatown, Bed-Stuy (Brooklyn) and Jackson Heights (Queens)—to name but a few.
Students will also have an opportunity to visit several of the city’s major museums and collections, to
meet with community-based organizations and to attend a range of cultural events (music, film and
theater). Through it all, the course will meet for class lectures on the history and politics of New York City.
Course readings will draw from history, sociology, anthropology, geography, literature and film.
