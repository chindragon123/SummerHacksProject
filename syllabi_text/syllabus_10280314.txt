Textbook: Advertising and Integrated Brand Promotion, 8h Edition, O’Guinn, Thomas C., Chris
T. Allen, Angeline Close Scheinbaum, Richard J. Semenik, (Cengage Publishing, 2019)
Course Description:
         This course is designed as a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of
advertising and integrated brand promotion. The role of these persuasive communication tools within the
total marketing effort is studied. Advertising and IBP are presented and examined as (1) an element in our
social system; (2) a business process; (3) an art and communication form; and, (4) a science. The material
presented in class will supplement our textbook.
         ADV 318J will primarily be a live-lecture based course supplemented by online lecture content
through Canvas. These online materials will be available through a streaming media server which requires
a broadband (high speed) Internet connection. The WIFI network on campus is sufficient and there are
many computer labs on campus. If you do not have your own computer, or if you do not have a fast,
broadband connection, you can use these options.
Student Responsibilities:
         •Complete assigned readings prior to the lecture for which they are listed.
         •Check your email / Canvas messenger daily.
         •Examinations test conceptual understanding of lectures and the text. To do well on the
         exams -- study your lecture notes and assigned readings. You are responsible for all
         material assigned for each exam.
         •You should develop an awareness of the trends and issues concerning advertising and
         public relations through the weekly reading of Advertising Age, PR Week and AdWeek.
         You should also become especially aware of current advertising/pr methods and practices
         by observing and critically evaluating ads and promotions you see and hear every day.
Grading Rules:
         •Assignments must be in on time. If work is late, a grade of "0" will be assessed. All
         assignments must be submitted via Canvas in PDF format.
         •No make-up exams or assignments.
         •Any questions about a grade must be discussed within one week after the grade is
         posted.


Method of Evaluation
          Overall letter grades are based on point totals calculated by adding: (1) four exams (200 points
each), (2) two projects (150 points total) MindTap quizzes (50 points total) Course grades are based on
each student’s total out of the 1,000 points available. The points necessary to earn a letter grade are as
follows:
                                  A=910, A-=870-909.9, B+=850-869.9, B=795-849.9
     C+=766.7-794.9, C=733.4-766.6, C-=695-733.3, D+=666.7-694.9, D=633.4-666.6, D-=595-633.3,
                                                              F=<595.
           The final exam is optional. You may choose to take the comprehensive final exam (worth 200
points). If the final exam score is higher than the lowest exam score, it will be substituted in place of the
exam score. There are no extra credit assignments, redoing projects or exams -- the only way to earn a
grade is by doing well on the exams and projects. You should check Canvas to confirm your grades on
exams, and projects are recorded correctly. Report any errors immediately.
 NOTE: Students must earn at least a B in this class to apply or continue as an advertising/PR major.
Exam Policy
          There will be four exams during the semester and an optional final scheduled during the University
final exam period. Exams consist of 40 multiple choice and true/false questions and given in the
classroom on exam days. If you miss an exam during the semester for any reason, you must take the
comprehensive final exam. There are no other make-up exams.
Individual Projects
          Grades on the two individual projects have a significant impact on your final course grade. The
TA will grade these projects. Note that although you are encouraged to discuss projects with others in
class, you may only turn in your own, original work.
          If you have a question about your grade on a project, you must contact your TA immediately.
Project grades will be discussed only during the week immediately following their posting.
After that, grade changes will not be discussed -- no exceptions.
          Finally, following instructions is an important part of responding to these projects and no late
assignments will be accepted for any reason -- projects are due at 11:00 AM and may be submitted early.
The ability to meet deadlines and attend to details is an important part of the advertising and public relations
business.
MindTap Quizzes.
           Grades on the MindTap portion of the class are worth a total of 50 points. MindTap is a digital
learning tool offered by the book publisher Cengage and is a part of your textbook purchase. Your grade
will consist of eighteen, chapter quizzes available through Canvas. Each quiz will count 2.5 points and is
due before the four forty question exams held in the classroom. You get two attempts at each quiz to earn
your best score and they may be completed any time before the due dates on Canvas. Your scores are
automatically calculated by Canvas and entered in the gradebook following your completion of the quizzes.
These are a learning tool that you should use to help assess your knowledge of the textbook material prior to
the in-class exams. Access the exams by MODULES>OguinnAdvertising and Integrated Brand
Promotion8e Mindtap>MindTap>Load mindTap in a new window> Group 1>Chapter Quiz. If you
complete all of the quizzes, you will be awarded 5 additional points!

Scholastic Dishonesty Policy: The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty
also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test,
quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic
dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who
violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the
course and/or dismissal from the University. For more information on scholastic dishonesty, please visit the Student Judicial
Services Web site at http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/.
Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
Title IX information: The University of Texas is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students that is free
of all forms of discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and
stalking. If you (or someone you know) has experienced or experiences any of these incidents, know that you are not alone. The
university has staff members trained to support you in navigating campus life, accessing health and counseling services,
providing academic and housing accommodations, helping with legal protective orders, and more.
Please be aware all UT faculty members are “responsible employees,” which means that if you tell me about a situation
involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I must share that information with
the Title IX Coordinator. Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be handled, including
whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available
to you and have access to the resources you need.
