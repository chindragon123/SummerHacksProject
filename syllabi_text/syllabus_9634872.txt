A. Description
This course serves as an introduction to the study of the Spanish language both as a system and as
an expression of cultural practices, beliefs, and histories in Spanish-speaking areas of the
world. Topics to be addressed include historical development and dialectal diversity; elements of
sound and structure; discursive and pragmatic properties; and language use in contact contexts in
communities of Spanish language speakers. While students may not become Hispanists or
linguists, they will develop an appreciation of the Spanish language and of various specialized
areas within the discipline of linguistics.
Note: This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices,
beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.

C. Portfolio on Padlet
One of the most important parts of the class is your own discovery in to the world of
linguistics and Hispanic linguistics. We will be using a Padlet wall (http://padlet.com) for
students to create a portfolio of ancillary content to our chapters. You will need to create
a padlet account in order to create a wall. Make sure you change the web address of your
padlet to one easy to remember and disable the privacy settings. The first day of class
send me the link to your padlet to c.dunlap@austin.utexas.edu. On the wall, create and
identify a space for each chapter listed below. As you add content, be creative. This
content could be vocabulary, lists, surveys, augmented reality, interactive videos, online
quizzes, surveys, bulletin boards, mind maps, etc. Build content for each of the seven
chapters. For each chapter you are required to add 4 elements and write a brief 50-word
summary in which you explain how the item that you have added to the wall relates to the
chapter topics. There are seven days when you are required to complete your wall
portfolio (one for each chapter). Each chapter is worth 50 points, for a total of 350 points
for the semester. The padlet wall for our course is https://padlet.com/cdunlap6/330L.
Capítulo uno: Introducción a la lingüística.

Capítulo tres: La morfología.
Capítulo cuatro: La sintaxis.

D. Padlet presentations
Twice during the session, you will present to the class one or more of your padlet entries.
You need to give a summary of the entries and tell the class why you chose these and
why they are relevant to the chapter. Then you will show one or more entry(ies) to the
class. When you are done with the presentation, you will ask the class a question that
you have prepared about one your entries. The question needs to appear on your padlet
wall. These questions may appear on the test. The presentation should be about 8
minutes. Make sure you introduce the entry(ies) adequately rather than just showing
it(them) to us. One of the presentations will be on chapters 1-4 and the other on chapters
5-7. These presentations should help you and your classmates better understand the
material in the chapter and help in preparation for the exams. If you are absent the day
you are to make a presentation, you may not make it up. If you know well ahead of time
that you will not be present, let me know as soon as possible and we can attempt to
reschedule your presentation, however this must take place before the exam that your
presentation is based on. Each presentation is worth 50 points.
  Presentation:                                     40      35     30     20      0
  Choice is relevant to chapter, is not the same
  as another student’s, is presented on assigned
  day, and lasts no more than eight minutes.
  Question:                                         10       8     6       4      0
  Question is relevant to the material
  presented. The question is of medium
  difficulty. It is not just a yes or no question.
  The question appears on the padlet wall.
E. Preparation of “preguntas”.
The book we are using presents 101 interesting questions and answers about Spanish
written in English. You are required to read all of the assigned questions as arranged by
topic that you will find on the daily plan. I have prepared questions written in Spanish on
the Questions for you to write the answers to in Spanish and to bring prepared to class as
we will be discussing and sharing answers in groups. You will be graded on completing
ALL of the questions by the due date. The material in these questions will undoubtedly
appear on the exams. The grade will be a completion grade of all (25 points each except
for topic 5 which will be worth 50 points) or nothing (0).
F. Chapter Exams
Four times during the session we will have an in-class written exam.
                                                 3


The content of the exams is based on material presented in class and the padlet
presentations as well as on the required text. These exams are worth 75 points for a total
of 350 points.
G. Participation
Two self-evaluations* based on a rubric measuring group participation, use of Spanish,
attendance and tardies, preparedness for class, and classroom etiquette will be available
on Canvas and on my padlet for you to print out, fill out, and bring to class on the
assigned day.
As the principal methodologies used in this class will be small group collaboration and
class discussion, your participation is of utmost importance. Flawless Spanish is NOT
expected from you but your best efforts are. *I reserve the right to override the grade you
give yourself on the participation rubric based upon my observations.
H. Attendance
As we will only be meeting for five weeks, attendance at each class session is mandatory.
We will be covering a great deal of material in each class therefore, please do not miss
class. Each student starts the semester with one “free” absence which include absences
resulting from representation and participation in university sponsored activities,
religious holidays, illnesses and family emergencies. If more than one absence is to be
accrued with these types of absences, please talk to me and provide documentation. Each
absence thereafter reduces the total grade by 3 percentage points.
I. Grading
The final grade is based on the percentage of total points earned.
  93-100 = A             83-86.99 = B           73-76.99 = C          63-66.99 = D
  90-92.99 = A-          80-82.99 = B-          70-72.99 = C-         60-62.99 = D-
  87-89.99 = B+          77-79.99 = C+          67-69.99 = D+         0-59.99 = F
Scores are not rounded. No late work or make up work is allowed. Points are distributed
on the following basis:
                                                              Method of grading

J. University Policies & Procedures
The University of Texas Honor Code: The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are
learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member
of the University is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and
respect toward peers and community.
Scholastic Dishonesty: The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism,
unauthorized collaboration, falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid
participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not
limited to, providing false or misleading information to receive a postponement or an extension
on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same written assignment for
two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. Students who violate University rules
on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Services for Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon
request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more
information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
Religious Holidays: Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class schedules. If you miss a
work assignment or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day you will be given
an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. Students
must notify the professor prior to the classes scheduled on dates they will be absent to observe a
religious holy day.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): If you are worried about someone who is acting
differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss your concerns about
another individual’s behavior. Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Emergency Evacuation Policy: Occupants of buildings on the UT campus are required to
evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made.
Students should (1) Familiarize themselves with all exit doors of the classroom and the building;
(2) Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one they entered; (3) Inform the instructor
during the first week of class if they require assistance in the event of an evacuation; (4) Follow
the instructions of class instructors; (5) Not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the
Austin Fire Department, the UT-Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
K. Classroom Professionalism Policy
The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the class. Faculty are
expected to be professional and prepared to deliver value for each and every class
session. Students are expected to be professional in all respects.
The classroom experience is enhanced when:
•    Students arrive on time. On time arrival ensures that classes are able to start and
     finish at the scheduled time. On time arrival shows respect for both fellow students
     and faculty and it enhances learning by reducing avoidable distractions.
•    Students minimize unscheduled personal breaks. The learning environment
     improves when disruptions are limited.
•    Students are fully prepared for each class. Much of the learning takes place during
     classroom discussions. When students are not prepared, they cannot contribute to the
                                                   5


     overall learning process. This affects not only the individual, but their peers who
     count on them, as well.
•    Students respect the views and opinions of their colleagues. The expression and
     defense of opinions are encouraged and part of the academic environment.
     Intolerance for the views of others is unacceptable.
•    Laptops and wireless devices are only used for course activities. In this class we
     use the Internet for the delivery of almost all of our course content. You are welcome
     and encouraged to bring your laptop or mobile devices to class. However, when
     students are surfing the web, responding to e-mails, instant messaging each other, etc.
     they are doing a disservice to their peers and potentially causing a distraction.
     Restrict use to items related to the course.
Your professionalism and activity in class contributes to your success in attracting the
best faculty to this program.
