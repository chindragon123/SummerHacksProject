a variety of digital software tools. This course introduces all students to the fundamentals of good graphic design, as well as
production basics. Students will then build their digital design skills using industry-standard software, from print (Adobe InDesign,
Illustrator, Photoshop) to motion (Adobe Premiere) and interactive (HTML, CSS, Dreamweaver). Assumes no prior knowledge.
Course Outcomes:
 1. Adobe CC Skills: Ability to use various Adobe professional-level applications to create brand messages.
 2. Craft: How well a message is conceptualized, designed, and constructed digitally.
 3. Visual Communication: Understanding how we communicate visually, in static, motion, and interactive media.


Coursework.
Module Projects: In each learning module, you'll be assigned various projects to learn the theoretical fundamentals as well as
practical skills of designing and producing work using various Adobe CC programs. Each module includes projects, quizzes, and a
capstone piece to demonstrate both your theoretical and hands-on skills.
Grades.
Here’s how your final course grade will be calculated:
100% = 4 Module Projects (25% each; graded)
Final letter grades are calculated according to these cutoffs—no exceptions:
A = 94 to 100 A- = 90 to <94 B+ = 87 to <90 B = 87 to <84 B- = 84 to <80 C+ = 80 to <77 C = 77 to <74 C- = 74 to <70 D+ = 70
to <67 D = 67 to <64 D- = 64 to <61 F = 61 to 0
Policies:
Late Work
As a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry, you are expected to complete every module and project on time – no
exceptions. All projects are due on Canvas at the date and time indicated on the Class Calendar.
Emergencies happen, so you are allowed one “Late Pass” without penalty, which gives you an additional 2 days (48 hours) to
complete a single project. Thereafter, you will not be able to turn in any late projects under any circumstances, unless you already
have a prior exemption for a Religious Holy Day, a school-sponsored trip, or a doctor's note, obituary, or other issue that you can
document with a written excuse.
To use your Late Pass, please contact both the teacher and teaching assistant via e-mail BEFORE the project is due.
Scholastic Dishonesty
The Stan Richards School of Advertising has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course an/or dismissal from the
University. Please familiarize yourself with the University’s policy on Academic Dishonesty here
