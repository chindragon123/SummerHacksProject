                    Fundamentals of Biochemistry BCH 369 ­ Summer 2019
Instructor: David W. Hoffman, Associate Professor, Dept of Molecular Biosciences.
Office hours: My office is NHB 4.128. I'll have a regular office hour for this class on
    Fridays from 1 to 2:30 pm in NHB 4.202. Also, I am usually available right after class.
Email: dhoffman @ mail.utexas.edu.
Class meeting: Monday through Friday, 10 am, in Painter (PAI) 3.02.
Course unique number: 86610
Course description: This is a one semester course that covers the major concepts in
biochemistry, including the types of biomolecules, protein and enzyme structure, membranes,
and metabolism. The course may be of interest to students who are on a path toward a health
related field, or anyone interested in how living things work at the molecular level.
Textbook: "Essential Biochemistry" by Charlotte Pratt & Kathleen Cornely. Officially, it’s the
3rd edition. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th editions are extremely similar, so any of these should be fine.
I don’t think there is any significant difference between the editions.
Web page: Lecture slides and practice questions will be posted on the Canvas course page,
under the "pages" tab. A link to Canvas can be found on the UT home page.
Class attendance will not directly count toward grades. However, I think it is extremely
difficult to do well in the course without attending class regularly.
Exams will be given during the regular class time. Plan to take the exams on the scheduled
time. If you need to miss an exam due to extraordinary circumstances, inform me as soon as
possible so that other arrangements may be made.

Final exam: Covers the entire course, and is required. The final exam time and date will be set
by the UT registrar, and will likely be August 17 or 19.
Grading: Midterm exams are 100 pts each; the final exam will be 150 pts.
Your grade will be based on the total points you earn on the midterm exams, plus the final
exam. The final exam is required. Grades will be as follows:
      A 92 % of possible points ; A­ 90% of possible points
      B+ 87% to 90% ; B 83% to 87% ; B­ 80 to 83 %
      C+ 77% to 80% ; C 73% to 77% ; C­ 70 to 73 %
      D+ 67% to 70% ; D 63% to 67% ; D­ 60 to 63 %
      F <60 % of possible points
Incomplete grades will only be given in the case of truly extraordinary circumstances.
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the
Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities,
512­471­6259.
Regarding exam re­grades: Submit regrade requests in writing along with your graded
exam; include a brief written description of the grading error. Re­grade requests should be
submitted within one week of when the exam is returned.
UT Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty: In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the
University broadly defines scholastic dishonesty—basically, all conduct that violates this
standard, including any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved academic advantage,
such as falsifying academic records, cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,


collusion, misrepresenting facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain
an extended deadline for an assignment, or even gain an unearned financial benefit). Any other
acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity (e.g., multiple
submissions—submitting essentially the same written assignment for two courses without
authorization to do so). Several types of scholastic dishonesty—unauthorized collaboration,
plagiarism, and multiple submissions—are discussed in more detail on this Web site to correct
common misperceptions about these particular offenses and suggest ways to avoid committing
them. For the University’s official definition of scholastic dishonesty, see Section 11­802,
Institutional Rules on Student Services and Activities.
Recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and
Security, 512­471­5767 :
  ­ Occupants of buildings are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated; exit
and assemble outside.
  ­ Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
  ­ Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the
first week of class.
  ­ Do not re­enter a building unless given instructions by the Fire Department, The University
of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
