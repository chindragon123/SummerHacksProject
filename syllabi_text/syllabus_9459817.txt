                                                              Course objectives
               The purpose of this course is to give you a solid foundation in theories of learning and
               motivation that inform learning and teaching strategies. When you have completed the course,
               you should be able to:
                     1.  discuss and apply the various theoretical perspectives
                     2.  recognize examples of the theory in everyday instructional practice
                     3.  relate them to yourself as a learner through examples and scenarios
                     4.  relate them to your future professional work even if it’s not in education
               The semester will be divided into three units:
                         Unit 1 – Cognition: learning and memory
                         Unit 2 – Critical thinking, assessment, and socially­based learning
                         Unit 3 – Motivation and metacognition
               Each unit will be evaluated on a separate test and have a set of activities associated with it. You
               will work individually and in groups throughout the semester.
                                                      Website and Communication
               This course has a Canvas site associated with it (http://canvas.utexas.edu/). Canvas will be used
               to post announcements, course documents, assignments, supplementary materials, and lecture
               slides. Canvas allows me to email the whole class and to have announcements and assignment
               reminders posted to your page, so be on the lookout for messages from us on occasion. Please
               check which email address is being used by the University for you. If you have problems with
               computer access, please let me know immediately so we can make other arrangements.
               The best way to reach me outside of class is via email. In the email subject title, make sure to
               include “ALD320”. I try to respond to email as promptly as possible; if 24 hours have passed
               without a response, please feel free to re­send the message. I would be happy to meet with you
               individually, so please come talk to me during office hours or make an appointment for another
               time.

                                                              Course Overview
               This class heavily relies on team­based learning. As such, you will be assigned to small groups
               based on your personal interests, preferences, and goals for each unit. Most class days will
               involve you working in your group to do in­class activities that will expand on the basics from
               the readings and prepare you for the exams.
               It is expected that readings will be completed before the class in which lecture on the topic is
               scheduled. Reading responses should be submitted by 9am each Tuesday (except for Week 14,
               where the reading response is due by 9am on Thursday).
               On Tuesdays, we will cover the week’s content with an interactive lecture, with activities
               interspersed. Thursdays are generally used to discuss any material not covered the previous class
               day, do in­class activities that will expand on the basics from the readings and lecture, and
               review material covered the previous class day. Some class periods will be devoted to more
               in­depth work on application of theories to class design scenarios.
               On occasion, we’ll ask you to complete some online surveys that will be used to help us gauge
               class interest in various topics and activities.
               There will also be two application assignments to be completed outside of class for credit. These
               writing assignments allow you to apply what you have learned. Examples of the types of
               assignments you may receive include analyzing a classroom scenario, analyzing yourself as a
               learner, collecting and analyzing peers’ reflections on group work, analyzing a video of a
               classroom, designing a class period, or finding a video that illustrates a unit’s topic. You will be
               given two options for each of the application assignments.
                                                                     Text
               No textbook will be required in this course. However, some students prefer to have a textbook
               to supplement their learning in the course. Here are is a textbook that cover most of the key
               concepts that you will be learning:
                                   Human Learning by Jeanne Ormrod
               Any edition of the book will be useful, and older editions are likely to cost much less.
               Instead of a textbook, all of the assigned readings will be taken from various sources and posted
               in the “Readings” folder on Canvas.
                                                                       2

               You can demonstrate your efforts and learning in the class and earn credits toward your final
               grade on a variety of assignments. A total of 400 points will be available throughout the course.
               Grades will be distributed according to the following scale:
                                                   A:      92.5-100%        370­400 points
                                                   A­:     89.5-92%         358­369.5 points

               IMPORTANT: If you wish to contest the grading of any item, you will be asked to fill out an
               Item Review Form, which is provided on the course Canvas site.
               Please check your point status after each exam or assignment. Please keep your records up to
               date because late assignments will not be accepted. I also recommend that you keep a copy of
               all group work so that we have a way to verify your work if there are discrepancies.
               Reading Responses (5%).
               In each week, there will be several assigned readings. You are expected to read the assigned
               articles for each week before lecture. In addition to reading them, each week, you will also be
               asked to write a reading response about the content of the articles. Sometimes these reading
               responses will be due before the lecture; sometimes these reading responses will be due after the
               lecture. Check Canvas for the deadlines! Reading responses must be completed by 9am each
               due date. Each of the 10 reading responses will be worth 2 pts, for a total of 20 pts.
               There is not a mandatory reading response for the first week, but there is a place where you can
               write a summary for bonus points.
                                                Why do I have to write reading responses?
                    1. You will come to class better aware of what you do or don’t understand and can be ready
                         to ask questions.

                         waiting to be filled.
                    3. You will be ready to do extension activities in class, and so will learn more and better

               In­class activities (10%).
               There will be 10 in­class activity opportunities (on Tuesdays in the first half of the semester; on
               Thursdays after Spring Break). Thinking up and comparing examples and active practice are
               excellent ways to learn new material. To help you do this, we will have small in­class groups in
               which you can work cooperatively to generate a set of examples and activities to submit for
               credit. Each daily set of activities is worth 4 points, for a total of 40 points. These in­class
               activities assignments should be uploaded to Canvas within 30 minutes of the end of each class.
               There will be no make­ups for missed in­class activities. The lowest in­class activity score,
               however, will be dropped and replaced with a 4.
               Group Design­A­Class and Design­a­Guide (12.5%).
               These are group assignments at the end of the semester that require application of what we’ve
               learned across the course. In the design­a­class, you’ll be applying what you’ve learn to
               designing a class. In the design­a­guide, you’ll be applying what you’ve learned to designing a
               guide for incoming freshmen. Points are available only to people in attendance on the application
               day. Specific instructions for the activity will be given in class the day before the activity day so
               that students may prepare individually before working together. Each activity is worth 25 points,
               for a total of 50 points. These design activities should be uploaded to Canvas within 30 minutes
               of the end of each class.
               If you are absent you will have to do the assignment by yourself to get credit. This make­up,
               individual Design­a­X assignment will be due by Sunday, May 5th at 11:59pm.
               Unit exams (45%).
               After each unit, there will be a unit exam. Exams will consist of a mix of multiple­choice items
               and short­answer items. There will be three unit exams (Feb 19, Mar 14, and Apr 23), worth 60
               points each, for a total of 180 points.
               There are no make­ups for unit exams. If your final exam score is higher than your lowest unit
               exam score, then your final exam will replace that lowest unit exam score.
               Application assignments (12.5%).
               There will be two application assignments. These will be out­of­class assignments due on Feb
               26th, and Mar 28th. Specific instructions for the application assignment will be made available at
               least three­weeks in advance of the due date. Examples of the types of assignments you will
               receive include analyzing a classroom scenario, analyzing yourself as a learner, collecting and
               analyzing peers’ reflections on group work, analyzing a video of a classroom, designing a class
               period, or finding a video that illustrates a unit’s topic. You will be given several options for each
               of the three application assignment opportunities. Each application assignment is worth 25
               points, for a total of 50 points. These application assignments should be submitted to Canvas by
               11:59pm of the due dates.

               Final exam (15%).
               A cumulative final exam will be held in our final class: May 9th. The final exam will be worth
               60 points ­­ it will be the same length as the unit exams. There will be no make up for the final
               exam. If you know that you will not be able to make it to the final exam, please let the instructor
               know as soon as possible, and at least fourteen days prior to the scheduled exam.
               If you have to miss the final exam due to unforeseen circumstances, please let the instructor
               know as soon as you can and provide written proof (e.g., medical note, police report). In this
               case, you may be assigned an Incomplete for the course at the instructor’s discretion and if it
               meets the university criteria for an incomplete. The instructor will determine the exact
               procedures by which a student will make up the work.
                                                       Guidelines for Assignments
               Every component of the course, except for the unit exams and final exam will be turned in via
               Canvas. In other words, the weekly reading responses, in­class activities, group design­a­class,
               group design­a­guide and application assignments will all need to be submitted to Canvas.
               Note that everything uploaded to Canvas will also be automatically checked against Turnitin.com
               for plagiarism.
               There will not be many essay­type assignments, but if you want to cite sources, then we
               recommend using APA style. For guidance, see https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html

               Statement on Learning Success: Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need
               accommodations because we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent
               you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll
               develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage
               you to reach out to the student resources available through UT. Many are listed on this syllabus,
               but I am happy to connect you with a person or Center if you would like.
               Services for Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request
               appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. To determine if
               you qualify, please contact the Dean of Students at 471­6259; TTY 471­4641.
               The twelfth class day is February 6th, which is the last day to possibly get a refund if you drop a
               class.
               Religious Holy Day Observance: Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and
               examination schedules. If you miss a work assignment or other project due to the observance of a
               religious holy day you will be given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a
               reasonable time after the absence. It is the policy of the University of Texas at Austin that you
                                                                       6

               must notify each of your instructors at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates
               you will be absent to observe a religious holy day.
               Non­medical Absences: If you are going to miss class due to an involvement in university
               activities at the request of University officials (e.g., athletic events), you must notify your
               instructor at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be absent and
               provide documentation. You will be given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a
               reasonable time after the absence.
               The University of Texas Honor Code: The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are
               learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each
               member of the University is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust,
               fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
               Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism: The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating,
               plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, falsifying academic records, and any act designed to
               avoid participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is
               not limited to, providing false or misleading information to receive a postponement or an
               extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same written
               assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. Scholastic dishonesty
               damages both the student’s learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a
               work-career. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to
               disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
               University. For more information on scholastic dishonesty, please visit the Student Judicial
               services Web site at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs
               Personal Pronoun Use: Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with
               respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics,
               sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the
               instructor with the student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an
               alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so
               that I may make appropriate changes to my records.

               Title IX Reporting: Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based
               discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence
               and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a

               learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual
               misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
               1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
               2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
                         become involved in a Title IX investigation.
               3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
               Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
               “Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the
               Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related
               incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one­on­one. Before talking with me, or
               with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they
               are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without
               making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more
               information about reporting options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX
               Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
               Safety information: Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are
               required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
               requires exiting and assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each
               classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the
               one you used when entering the building.
               Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the
               first week of class.
               In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not
               re­enter a building unless given instructions by The University of Texas at Austin Police
