Purpose of Course:
The purpose of the class is to develop your ability to understand how U.S. tax law analyzes transactions
involving more than one national jurisdiction. The core of the course is an understanding of how the United
States, and to some extent, other countries, exercise their jurisdictions to tax income from international
transactions. The course will also include an examination of the U.S. taxation of foreign-based income (foreign
tax credits, Subpart F), the role of income tax treaties, determination of appropriate transfer prices between
affiliated companies and the treatment of income from intellectual property.
Class Schedule
Thursday, October 10, will be HAT DAY. Everyone must wear a hat to class.
Part of the class on Tuesday, September 17, will be devoted to a session on preparing the Practice
Memorandum assigned on Monday, September 16. This memo will be due on Thursday, September 19.
There will be no class on Thursday, November 14 or on Tuesday, November 26.
Course Materials
The course materials will consist of readings in Kuntz & Peroni, U.S. International Taxation, which is available
in RIA-Checkpoint. Go to Table of Contents, then International Tax Library, then WG&L International
Treatises, then Kuntz & Peroni. The cases and other materials listed in the last column of this syllabus are
collected in a packet which should be purchased at the COPY CENTER on the Third Floor in GSB. Finally,
there are a few readings from the Hellerstein book, to be found in RIA, under the category “State Taxation”
From time to time, there may also be other materials, including cases, regulations and rulings, all distributed to
you on Canvas or by email.
Classroom Deportment
Cell phones must be turned off while you are in class. You may NOT use laptops in class. Beverages are
OK, but no food in class.
Evaluation and Grades
I will determine your final grade on the basis of two factors: written assignments during the course (70%),and
your participation in our discussions during class (30%). There will be no exams.
Reading Assignments
The tax issues involved in international transactions are difficult and complex, and even in a summary course
such as this one the reading assignments are both detailed and long. Moreover, the knowledge in classes 1, 2
and 3 will form the base for understanding the material in classes 4, 5, and 6, and so on. You cannot fall
behind in these assignments
                                                          1


Written Assignments
There will be three written assignments in the form which you, as professionals, would prepare for clients or
employers. These may take the form of memoranda or drafting of sections of acquisition agreements. The
memorandum assignments will be given to you on Monday, September 30, Monday, October 28, and
Monday, December 2, respectively, and you will have 3 days to complete them.
Class Participation
Just as I expect you to be able to communicate your analysis and conclusions in writing (in the memoranda
discussed above), I also expect every student to participate regularly in our class discussion. There will be no
exceptions; you cannot succeed in this course unless you are prepared every day to recite in class. It
is far more important for each student to make efforts than to get the “right” answer. As professionals, all of the
knowledge in the world will accomplish nothing unless it is coupled with the ability to express it clearly and to
discuss it with your peers. I will grade each student each day on participation.
Missed Assignments and Attendance
You will be excused from turning in work timely if you are deceased or if you become a parent during the
semester. I am willing to entertain other excuses, but don’t get your hopes up. A similar policy applies to
taking an “incomplete” for the course.
Scholastic Dishonesty--Departmental Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty. The Department of Accounting
has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard
to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty.
By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all the faculty responsibilities described in that document. By
enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all the student responsibilities described in that document. If
the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your
responsibility to ask me for clarification.
Memoranda: Each student is expected to complete the memoranda independently during the designated
memorandum period. No student may refer to other students’ memorandum solutions or discuss the
memorandum with other students during the memorandum period.
Professional Conduct. The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs
community. The collective class reputation and the value of the Texas experience hinges on this.
Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, you may call the Office of the
Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
