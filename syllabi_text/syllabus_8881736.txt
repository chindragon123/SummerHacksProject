Course description
This course is an introduction to the study of culture through expressive media. Stories and
other kinds of narrative media are treated as important cultural objects which are at once
representative and productive of a society’s values, identities, practices, anxieties, and ideals.
By considering stories in context, and by addressing both the intended and unintended
consequences of their dissemination, students will be encouraged to think about the role of
narrative in everyday life in a number of cultural settings.
Readings and classroom dynamic
Readings are outlined in the course schedule below, and will all be available either as PDFs
on Canvas or through the UT library online. There is no course packet for this course.
Students will be expected to arrive in class having read the assigned readings for that day.
Classes on Mondays and Wednesdays will largely be traditional ‘lectures’, while your Friday
sections will take the form of whole-class discussions. You must come prepared to discuss
the course materials in these sections. Discussions will focus on the readings and the media
you will consume during the Tuesday and Thursday night screenings, and will at times
address sensitive and controversial themes. As such it is imperative that students engage with
one another in a respectful and measured way. The best way to ensure the classroom dynamic
remains respectful is to come to class prepared, so do the reading.


Assessment
This course will be assessed through the completion of the following:
       Attendance –                            5%
       Participation –                         10%
       First group presentation –              10%
       Second group presentation –             15%
       First in-class exam –                   15%
       Second in-class exam –                  15%
       Final Assignment –                      30%
Grade Boundaries
The grade boundaries for this course will be as follows:
80-82 is a B - (minus)
83-86 is a B
87-89 is a B + (plus)
Grades will follow this pattern for all grades except for As. There are no A + grades at the
University of Texas. Decimal places greater than .75 may be rounded up at the Teaching
Assistant’s discretion.
There will be no opportunities for ‘extra credit’ in this class. Please do not bother your TAs
with requests for extra credit, as they will have neither the authority nor the inclination to
help you.
Group presentations
These presentations will be graded based on the overall quality of the group’s work. All
students in one group will received the same grade, unless there are notable extenuating
circumstances. This is non-negotiable. All students must contribute to the project, in both the
planning and execution stages, or else the grades of everyone in the group will suffer. These
presentations may be delivered in video form, at the discretion of your assigned Teaching
Assistant.
Examinations
There will be two in-class examinations over the course of the semester. These exams will
encompass material that has been covered previously in the course. Students will be expected
to apply knowledge gleaned from lectures, discussions, and readings, rather than simply
regurgitating it.


Attendance and participation
Attendance is, of course, mandatory. Two unexcused absences from discussion sections will
be allowed (and will not affect your grade), but all other absences must be either pre-arranged
with the professor or TA, or explained after the fact with a suitable excuse and some form of
official documentation. After those two unexcused absences you will be docked two
percentage points from your attendance grade per class missed. Should you miss more than
the five classes it would require for you to receive an attendance score of zero, you would be
docked 5% per subsequent class missed from your final grade, and would also receive a
participation score of zero.
If you have a prior engagement or scheduling conflict on the day of a discussion section, an
in-class exam, or a group presentation, you must let the professor or your TA know well in
advance, so that other arrangements can be made, or else your grade may be affected.
Participation in in-class discussions and group work will also have a significant bearing on a
student’s grade. A good attendance record will naturally be required for students to achieve
full credit for participation, but you will also be expected to contribute regularly to discussion
(having done the reading), and to work well with your peers in the production of effective
group presentations.
Tuesday and Thursday Evening Media Screenings
On weeks with assigned media, students will be required to either attend the screenings
provided or to watch/listen to the assigned pieces of expressive culture in their own time
prior to attending discussion sections. It is advised that students attend the media screenings,
as some of the media objects we will be discussing in class are either difficult or expensive to
obtain outside of class. Should a student arrive in discussion section multiple times clearly
having not watched or listened to the assigned media, both their attendance and participation
grades will suffer.
Media screenings will be held on:
Tuesdays at 7pm, in BUR 208
Thursdays at 6pm, in RLM 7.104
Final Assignment
The final assignment will be a cumulative take-home essay. The essay question will be
explained in lecture on December 5th, and elaborated upon in discussion sections on the 7th.
The assignment will be submitted via Canvas.


Students with disabilities
Accommodation will be made for students with disabilities in accordance with whatever
arrangements a student has in place with the Office for Students with Disabilities. Please
provide your Teaching Assistant with documentation of these arrangements as soon as
possible. Please do not wait until immediately before an exam to speak with your professor or
TA about this matter.
Academic integrity
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the
University, policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information,
please visit the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct.
Students will be expected to collaborate within their groups in the production of group
presentations, but in all other forms of assessment any work submitted by a student must be
the student’s own work.
