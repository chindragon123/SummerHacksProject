VI. Studying Japanese
       • In learning a foreign language, it is important to study every day.
       • Actively participate in class. Use Japanese whenever possible, and do not be afraid of making
         mistakes.
       • Spend as much time as possible, studying with online audio files.
                        http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072408154/student_view0/index.html
       • Develop a systematic way of organizing an increasingly large amount of material for which you
         will be responsible. Language learning requires constant review of previously-learned material.
       • You may want to make vocabulary cards or lists according to word groups.
       • Find your own leaning and organizational style, and continue reviewing on a daily basis.
       • Read the “Study Hints” in the textbook pages 3, 13, 51, 83, 115-6, 122-3, and 134-5 for suggestions.
