Prof. Shirley Thompson
Course Description:
This seminar examines the intersection of racial ideology and legal culture in the United
States. We will take a broad historical approach that spans the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, but we will also survey a range of contemporary sites where racial discourses
permeate American law and conceptions of the rights and responsibilities of citizens. The
legal construction of race in America is inextricably bound up with the development and
dissolution of the institution of race-based slavery. Therefore, a consideration of laws
concerning slavery, segregation, and desegregation will form the backbone of the course.
We will pay special attention to Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857); Plessy v. Ferguson
(1896); and Brown v. Board of Education (1954), cases that span a crucial century. By
considering the long trajectories of race, law, and social transformation, we will begin to
see how racial reasoning has informed many aspects of U.S. legal culture for a wide
range of ethnic and social groups and how race has influenced the development of
property law, family law, immigration law, and civil rights law.
This course will embrace interdisciplinary methods: we will put court cases in
conversation with literature, film, social scientific writings, music, and other pertinent
material. The goals of this course include 1. exploring the social and legal construction of
race at various moments in American history; 2. understanding the intersection of race,
gender, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and other markers of identity; 3. examining the
interpenetration of law and popular cultural forms; and 4. determining how race has
informed American conceptions of a wide variety of issues, such as privacy, property,
citizenship, national security, and sovereignty.
Paper Format: The Take-Home Essay must be typed, double-spaced, in 12-point Times
New Roman font with one-inch margins.
Make-Up Policy: Extensions on the graded assignments will be granted only in the case
of a medical or family emergency, or if you have official, documented University of
Texas business (including intercollegiate athletics) outside of campus. You must notify
me before the scheduled exam or due date; failure to do so will result in the automatic
subtraction of a letter grade. Assignments turned in late without an excuse will lose one
letter grade for each day past the exam or due date.
Preparation and participation: This class is reading-intensive. I will help you prioritize
by indicating from class to class which readings are most essential, and I will try to
prepare you for some of the most challenging readings. This is primarily a lecture class;


however, everyone should come to class prepared with questions! These questions should
not be of the “yes or no” or hypothetical variety. Their aim should be to open up
conversation about the reading. The success of this course depends on your prepared-ness
and your active participation.
Students with Children: I understand that minor illnesses and unforeseen disruptions in
childcare often put parents in the position of having to choose between missing class to
stay home with a child and leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not
feel comfortable with. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution,
occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly
acceptable. In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit close to
the door so that if your little one needs special attention and is disrupting learning for
other students, you may step outside until their need has been met. Non-parents in the
class, please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates. I ask that all
students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms
of diversity, including diversity in parenting status.
Civility: Some of our class time will be spent in discussion. Therefore it is important that
we show respect for each other by being attentive and polite. I encourage spirited debate
but expect that we will be civil in all our discussions. Class will begin promptly at 3:30.
Please be on time—late arrivals distract others.
Academic Dishonesty includes but is not limited to cheating; plagiarism (the
appropriation of another’s work and unauthorized incorporation of that work in one’s
own written work offered for credit); and collusion (the unauthorized collaboration with
another person in preparing college work offered for credit). These acts will be subject to
academic penalties.
Special Needs Accommodations Policy: Any student with a documented disability
(physical or cognitive) who requires academic accommodations should contact the
Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-
6259 (voice) or 471-4641 (TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing) as soon as
possible to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations.
Weapons Safety:
Please note that I do not allow concealed guns in my office and may remind you orally
when you visit. You may make arrangements to speak with me by phone during my
office hours. While I am not permitted to ban concealed weapons in our classroom,
please note that you must be 21 and older and hold a license for a firearm. Licensed
carriers must have the gun in a holster on or about them. Openly carried weapons are not
allowed on the UT campus. If a gun is visible in class, faculty and students are advised to
immediately call 911 and leave the room. For more information on campus safety and
campus-approved holsters, visit: http://campuscarry.utexas.edu
