Course Description:
Geographic location plays a key role in our understanding and interpretation of anthropological
phenomena from the location of primates under study, to finding hidden and remote archaeolog-
ical ruins, to mapping the distribution of bones and artifacts in an excavation or field area. Com-
puterized systems for the storage and analysis of spatial data, i.e. Geographical Information
Systems, as well as the analysis of imagery captured from the air, or space, i.e. Remote Sens-
ing, have become integral components in the data collection and analytical workflows of anthro-
pologists, geologists and paleontologists. This course surveys common GIS and remote sens-
ing techniques and provides a comprehensive overview of the standard workflows used in spa-
tial analysis. Students will learn the foundations of geospatial science, cartography and image
interpretation along with a basic understanding of quantitative geospatial analyses.
Main Learning Objective
     •   Understand the fundamentals of recording, managing and analyzing spatial data.
     •   Learning the basic workflows applied to geospatial data, and how these data are used in
          archeology, primatology and paleoanthropology.
     •   Hone problem-solving skills using spatial data.
     •   Develop proficiency with specialized software for spatial analysis.
Expected Learning Outcomes
     1.   Be able to create, load, view, modify and analyze spatial data in raster and vector for-
          mats.
     2.   Demonstrate understanding of the basic principles of cartography, computer systems
          and electromagnetism needed to properly utilize and interpret spatial data and remote
          sensing data.
     3.   Be knowledgeable about where and how to acquire data.
     4.   Use spatial data to answer questions.
Course Structure: This course is organized into weekly lab activities. The Tuesday session is
generally dedicated to presentation of new concepts and the Thursday session to application of
those concepts to solve and complete lab activities. This course emphasizes the development
of applied skills.

Prerequisites and Expectations: This is NOT an introductory course in GIS and remote
sensing. This is an accelerated course is GIS and RS fundamentals. There are no enforced
prerequisites, but students should have a comfortable working knowledge of computers and an
introductory GIS or remote sensing course is recommended but not required.
Required textbooks: The following book is required reading for this course. It is available
through the University Coop as well as other campus bookstores. It is also available for direct
purchase from the author in print or digital form. GIS and RS technology are developing rapidly
so the latest edition of the textbook is essential.
Bolstad, P (2019) GIS Fundamentals: A first text on geographic Information systems 6ed.,
XanEdu: Acton, MA.
Recommended Textbooks:
The following book is recommended for those who are brand new to GIS using ESRI software:
Michael Law and Amy Collings (2015) Getting to Know ArcGIS. ESRI Press: Redlands, CA.
Lectures and Lab: We will be using ESRI ArcGIS software and Leica ERDAS Imagine software
for remote sensing. Each student will have access to their own GIS/RS workstation during class
and in addition students have access to the GIS lab in RLP 3.104 in order to complete assign-
ments out-side of class. The RLP 3.104 lab is open during RLP building hours and requires a
UT proximity ID card for entry.
Grading: Grades for this course are based on 10 lab assignments (60%) and a midterm (20%)
exam, and a cumulative final exam (20%). Grading uses the +/- system. Final grades of A =
100-95, A- = 94-90, B+ = 89-87, B = 86-84, B- = 83-80 etc. Lab exercises are due by 2 PM on
Wednesday the week after they are assigned. Each lab is worth 6 points toward the final
grade. Late labs will be penalized 1 point.
Canvas. In this class we use Canvas—a Web-based course management system with
password-protected access at http://canvas.utexas.edu—to distribute course materials, to
communicate and collaborate online, to post grades, to submit assignments, and to give you
online quizzes and surveys. You can find support in using Canvas at the ITS Help Desk at 475-
9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., so plan accordingly.
Classroom Protocol. Civil and courteous behavior is expected during lectures and labs (It’s a
good idea outside of class too). Cell phone ringers must be turned off prior to the beginning of
lecture.
Honesty. Please pursue rigorous honesty in everything you do, including your work for this
class. It will serve you well in life, and in this class as well since we report all cases of suspected
academic dishonest to the dean of students. Dishonesty will result at least in a failed grade for
the assignment and perhaps also for the course. For a description of academic dishonesty, see
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_avoid.php. For more info, see
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/plagiarism
Religious Holidays. If you will not be able to attend class due to religious services, let me
know at least a week ahead of time. We will make every effort to help you keep up with course
assignments in such situations.

Disability Services. Students with documented disabilities may request appropriate academic
accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for
Students with Disabilities, 471-6259. Please let me know about any arrangements we can make
that will assist you in your learning.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL). If you are worried about someone who is acting
differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns
about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a partnership among the
Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the
Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD).

Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students. E-mail is recognized as an official
mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are responsible for reading your e-mail for
university and course-related information and announcements. You are responsible to keep the
university informed about changes to your e-mail address. You should check your e-mail
regularly and frequently—we recommend daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current
with university-related communications, some of which may be time-critical. You can find UT
Austin’s policies and instructions for updating your e-mail address at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564
Emergency Evacuation Policy. Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required
to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made.
Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation: Familiarize yourself with all exit
doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the
one you used when you entered the building. If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me
in writing during the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or
those of class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the
Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
Q drop Policy. Texas law limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six.
Senate Bill 1231 says: “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher
education may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses,
including any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher education,
unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
