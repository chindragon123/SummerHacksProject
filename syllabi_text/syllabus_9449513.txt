ARC 368R/ARC 388R
Instructor: Dr. Christopher Long
Office: Sutton Hall 4.104
Phone: 232.4084
E-mail: chrlong@utexas.edu
Office Hours: T TH 10-11; and by appointment
Time and Place: T TH 12:30-2:00; BTL 101
Prerequisites: Architecture students must have previously taken surveys 1 and 2 unless they
have permission from the instructor. Upper-division undergraduate and graduate students
from other departments are welcome to enroll with the consent of the instructor.
Description: This course will explore the history of architecture and design in what was
historically German territory from ancient times to the present. The emphasis of the course,
however, is on the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, especially the advent and
development of modernism. The course will also include a discussion of the development of
the major cities of the region, including Berlin and Munich, examining how industrialization,
rapid urbanization, and war shaped the distinctive face of each metropolis. The course will be
taught in a combined lecture and seminar format.
Educational Objectives: The aim of this course is to familiarize students with the historical
development of architecture in Germany; to introduce them to the basic trends and leading
architects and designers; and to acquaint them with the way in which historical change has
shaped the region's built environment.
Course Requirements: Class attendance is required. Grades will be based on one mid-term
examination (worth 30% of the final grade), one paper (undergraduates, 12-15 pages,
graduate students 15-20 pages; 40%; due on the final class day), and a comprehensive final
examination (30%). Plus/minus grading will be used for this course.
