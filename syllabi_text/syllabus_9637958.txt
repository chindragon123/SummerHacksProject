Special Testing Arrangements

academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the
Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY. If a student has a documented need for

Course Requirements
There are a number of different kinds of assignments for this class.
Attendance: The class involves a heavy component of discussion. While not everyone will feel
comfortable participating in the discussion, everyone should be there to hear it. I will take attendance on
random days. Your attendance grade will be based upon the percentage of days that you attended class
on which I took attendance.
Activities: A major goal of this class is to enable students to apply the material that we are discussing to
their own lives. The activities are designed to facilitate that kind of application. Each one involves trying
some initiative for a period of time, recording your reactions to the experience, and then writing a short
evaluation.
Exams: There will be a midterm and a non-cumulative final exam, focused primarily on the reading.
The exams will be of the short answer/short essay format.
Plagiarism
All assignments in this course may be processed by TurnItIn, a tool that compares submitted material to
an archived database of published work to check for potential plagiarism. Other methods may also be
used to determine if a paper is the student's original work. Regardless of the results of any TurnItIn
submission, the faculty member will make the final determination as to whether or not a paper has been
plagiarized.
Grading
Activities:      45%
Exams:           55%
All grades will be assigned using the plus/minus system, with letter grades assigned to points
earned according to the following distribution: A = 93-100, A- = 90-92; B+ = 87-89, B = 83-86, B- =
