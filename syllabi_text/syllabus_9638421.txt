Course overview:
Global Media Literacy is a faculty-led study-abroad course offered through the
University of Texas, in coordination with the Salzburg Global Seminar (an
international center based in Austria that seeks to challenge current and future
leaders to solve issues of global concern). As one of its programs the seminar
convenes the Salzburg Academy for Media and Global Change for some 80 students
and a dozen faculty in partnership with UT-Austin, along with several other
universities in the U.S., Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. See websites above
for details about the program context for the course, and sample of previous weekly
schedules of lectures, group-work, and other activities.
Each year a special theme is established as a vehicle for addressing the course goals.
This year the emphasis will be on the timely issue of global extremism (media
responses to global populism) and will be explained further through readings and
resources provided separately.
Students will explore how digital media technologies are shaping civic engagement,
activism, and innovation in a global media age. Students will work in a truly dynamic
global cohort, of fellow university students from 15 partner institutions, to build
digital stories, business plans, and content that helps provide innovative insights
into the role of media, technology, and activism in changing societies across borders,
across cultures, and across divides. Specifically, the course will examine how
distinctive global media shape views of politics, culture and society within nations,
across regions and internationally. The course will help students develop an
informed and critical understanding of how media shape and influence society and
communication in the global public sphere. The course will develop a critical
                                                                                      1

understanding of ideas around participatory technologies, collaborative media,
social networks, mobile platforms and digital culture.
Course Flag Note:
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments
covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group,
past or present.
COURSE GOALS:
   •   Students will learn how global media shape identities, stereotypes, and cross-
       cultural relationships
   •   Students will understand the digital media models that promoted communication
       and information flow across borders
   •   Students will learn to critically interpret powerful texts and images in the global
       public sphere
   •   Students will understand how collaborative technologies can give voice to
       marginalized communities
   •   Students will learn to engage in collaborative analysis of media messages and
       their influence on global audiences
   •   Students will gain the ability to build and develop innovative business plans for
       entrepreneurship in digital culture
   •   Students will learn hands-on digital storytelling skills
   •   Students will learn to work in international groups, alongside fellow students
       from all around the world.
   •   Students will become media literate—more active in their consumption,
       production, campaign, and community identities in local, national, and global
       communities.
OUTCOMES
The outcome of the course will be a student-created, open-sourced multimedia
educational framework for global media literacy. The students will work in cross-
national groups to create case studies, multimedia stories and media literacy action
plans that will take into account national and regional media business models as well as
national and regional media values and standards.
There has been little work as yet in the field of global media literacy, and no group
working in this field has had the advantages that the Summer Academy will have: a
global faculty and a global student body. The intent of this course is to identify new
entryways to global media literacy. Based on the student group projects, various
curricular approaches to teaching global media literacy are explored. For the last ten
years, the content created in Salzburg has been taken back by participating faculties to
                                                                                        2

their home institutions where the course and its parts are integrated, and the lessons
from those national experiments can be brought back to the Academy for revision and
expansion. To date, universities in over 100 countries have downloaded the Academy
content.
Required readings and assignments:
This is a somewhat unusual course structure, in that the instructor is participating
with a group of other faculty in developing course readings and assignments. We
have met throughout the first half of this year to prepare, and the instructions
coming from the director of the Academy are to be treated as approved by and
coming from your UT-Austin instructor. If you have any questions, of course, please
let me know. The other instructors and I will be conferring throughout the Academy
and I’ll be available as needed to consult with the “Longhorn delegation,” even if you
are assigned to a group other than my own specific one (Indeed, splitting you up is
considered a pedagogical strategy to ensure you can take best advantage of our
globally diverse group of participants).
Pre-academy readings and assignments will be sent to you electronically, with
clearly labeled instructions. Please read and follow the instructions carefully. These
are relatively straightforward and easily carried out in the time allotted, but are
designed to help prepare you and lay the groundwork for a successful Academy.
Pay close attention to the instructions and deadlines, as your performance will
be based on your timely participation.
**Pre-academy assignments are due July 16th.
A note about UT-Austin’s official summer calendar and the Academy:
Please note that the first official class day for second-term summer courses is July
16th, but because of coordination issues with the larger program, we are asking for
some work to be carried out before classes officially begin. Between these deadlines
and your arrival in Salzburg, however, there will be no additional work required of
you (other than your own self-directed readings).
You will see from the pre-assignment readings, that the major (and timely) theme is
that of global extremism, an issue that has already figured prominently in the
political season (both in the U.S. and with the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U.) The
assignments are intended to get you thinking about the issue with the context of
media literacy. The goal is to have you consider these issues at both the global and
local level.
The personal reflections and information you provide will be helpful in
personalizing the academy participants, with each other and with the faculty. Don’t
be daunted by what is expected ahead of time. It can be easily carried out with a
little thought and creativity.
                                                                                     3

Readings and assignments will be presented during the Academy once you’ve
arrived in Salzburg and will be fully explained at that time. Bring your laptop!
Should you wish to read even more broadly, here are some examples of readings
(not required) suggested in previous years for your information (these will give you
a sense of the types of questions writers have been raising on these topics). The

COURSE REQUIREMENTS & GRADING:
Pre-Academy Reading and Responses: 20% OF GRADE
    Carry out the work as assigned.
Global Media Literacy Readings and Academy work – 60% OF GRADE
    Students will read and participate as directed during the Academy with activities
    directed toward group work and developing case-study related projects. You will be
    graded on the quality of your work, collaborative effort, timely attendance, and
    participation.
Final paper: 20% OF GRADE
    All UT-Austin students will write a 5-page (double-spaced, not counting references)
    final paper, bringing together what you’ve learned from the Academy. The topic and
    focus will be discussed with the instructor and approved by him before you leave
    Salzburg. (You may of course begin your work before leaving, and I hope you will,
    but the final version is due after you return to Austin.) You will incorporate three
    sections, in roughly equal lengths: information from your case study and/or group
    work, your analysis of the global media literacy issues involved (making references
    to at least 10 written resources from class readings or your own), and your own
    self-reflection on what you have learned from the Academy and how.
    Again, much of this will be inclusive of your previous academy work, but it is helpful
    for me to see it all incorporated into one document that is yours alone.
    **Final paper due August 17th, PDF document by email attachment to the
    instructor.
Course schedule
General dates are provide on the Academy website and email communications, but
the actual 2018 daily schedule will be provided to you shortly before you arrive (but
for an example of previous formats you may consult the website above). Because
speakers and other opportunities may require some flexibility, the schedule is
subject to change, although this will be kept to a minimum.

Special note on plagiarism:
The student Senate has asked that all syllabi emphasize the importance of academic
integrity. In a writing course, a key threat to this integrity is plagiarism. As
freshmen you’re just starting your college career, having digested countless amount
of media mashups, borrowings, photoshoppings, and YouTube memes. Be reminded
that use of material not your own without proper attribution is plagiarism. Here is a
library module with more information:
