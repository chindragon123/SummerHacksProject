                                       Course Objectives
• Explain how the definition and history of ASD impacts prevalence numbers
• Compare and contrast quantitative and qualitative research in educational settings
• Explain how the questions researchers ask determine the methods they use to study
    ASD
• Describe various research methods used by researchers to study ASD
• Identify strengths and limitations of various educational research methods
                                        Course Format
You will take this class online. The class will not meet in person or online synchronously,
and there will be no scheduled exams or lectures.
You are encouraged to access the course content regularly and treat this class as if we met
regularly. By doing so, you will be able to actively participate in class activities, complete
your assignments, and access announcements in a timely manner.
You can complete this course in a condensed period. That doesn’t mean that you should,
though.
You must complete each
module in order to move on
to the next module. The
lessons build on each other,
so skipping around between
modules doesn’t make
sense.
Strong time management
skills will be your best asset
in this course. Poor time
management is a major
reason why grades suffer in
online courses.

Detailed guidelines and evaluation criteria for assignments will be provided. The following descriptions
serve as an overview of the expectations for each assignment.
We’ve set up due dates in Canvas for when we think you should complete modules in order to spread out
the workload AND best meet our course objectives. There will be no penalty for late work, though. All
assignments are due at 11:59 pm on Thursday, July 9th. All work must be turned in by then.
1. Module Prompts. (150 points; 10 prompts x 15 points each) At the end of each module, you will write a
   brief (less than 200 words) response or record a short video reaction (less than 90 seconds) to a prompt
   provided on Canvas. Prompts will be graded on a 15-point scale.
2. Module Quizzes. (100 points; 10 quizzes x 10 points each). As you complete each module, you will take a
   ten-question quiz to assess your understanding of the content covered in each module. Before you start
   the quiz make sure you have completed the readings and watched the videos found in the module. Each
   quiz consists of a bank of questions, and you will be given 10 questions to answer from the bank.You
   have two chances to take each quiz; the highest grade will count. Once you choose to start each quiz,
   you will have 90 minutes to complete all 10 questions. You may refer back to the content in the module to
   answer your questions, but you must submit an answer for each question within the 90 minutes. NOTE:
   Time begins from the moment you start the Module Quiz and runs continuously: once time begins there
   is no way to pause it, including loss of connectivity or logging out, so please plan accordingly.
3. Research Analysis: 50 points. For this assignment, students will be assigned an article to annotate,
   summarize, and critique. The article review should identify the following: rationale, research question(s),
   participants and relevant characteristics, settings and materials used, variables, results, and strengths and
   limitations of the study. You will be filling out a template for this assignment; it is not a paper. The review
   will also contain a section where you will “translate” the research findings into practice-friendly language.
   A rubric is posted on Canvas.

    “I view ‘autistic’ as a word for a part of how my brain works, not for a narrow set of
  behaviors and certainly not for a set of boundaries of a stereotype that I have to stay

                                               Important Notes
• Life happens. Please let the instructional team know if things beyond this course may be affecting your
   ability to complete work for this class in a timely manner.
• Your success is important to us. We will all need accommodations because we all learn differently. If
   there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or cause you to feel excluded, please let
   the instructional team know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to both meet your
   needs and the requirements of the course.
• You need to be fully present when logged into class. It is impossible to participate in this class while
   texting, Snapchatting, tweeting, working on other things, online shopping, etc. When taking an online
   class, it is tempting to think that you can keep Google Messenger (for example) open while navigating
   through the module. If you need to take a break while accessing a module, do it. The modules do not
   need to be completed in one sitting.

• All communication will be through Piazza. We will use the Piazza Discussion board to ask/ answer
   questions about content, course logistics, etc. This should be your fi rst stop when you have a question; it
   may be that it is already asked and answered. If you have a personal question, you may message
   instructors privately through the Piazza Discussion Board.
• We will use the class Facebook Page to post articles, video clips, etc. You do not have to engage by
   posting or commenting on the class Facebook page. However, if (and only if) you have made at least 3
   contributions on the class FB page, we will bump your grade up by 1 percentage point, should you find
