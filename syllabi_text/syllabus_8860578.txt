COURSE OBJECTIVES
    •   Provide an overview of key theories in the advertising discipline.
    •   Help students propose an extension of existing theory relevant to their research
        interests.
    •   Help students design an empirical study using the extended theory, and develop an
        understanding of the social scientific method of conducting research.
COURSE MATERIALS
    •   Textbook: Advertising Theory (Routledge Communication Series) 1st Edition by Shelly
        Rodgers & Esther Thorson (available online through the UT library)
    •   Journal articles are available online through the UT library and/or will be posted to the
        CANVAS website.
COURSE ASSIGNMENTS AND EVALUATION
Class Participation (7%)
You are expected to arrive in class having completed the readings assigned for that day.
Readings are critical to fully understanding and engaging with the topics covered in this class.
Active participation, from all members of the class, is crucial to the success of any doctoral
seminar. Although your personal experiences may be relevant, the most valuable contributions
will be your scholarly rather than personal opinions and will reflect your efforts to synthesize
and apply course readings.
Discussion Questions (30%)
Every student should upload their discussion questions for the following week to CANVAS
(deadline: 11:59 pm Saturday for Tuesday readings, 11:59 pm Monday for Thursday
readings). Each reading requires one question. Along with the question, provide a brief
background of your idea and clearly identify the chapter or article on which your question is


                                                                                                   Oh 2
based. Put your questions in a word file with your name at the top. Your submission has to
be less than one page (single-spaced).
Good questions are meant to promote discussion. Questions might reflect the elements of the
reading you felt were confusing or flawed and that warrant further scrutiny, or elements of the
reading you found fascinating and worth further exploration, including possible applications
and comparisons between the reading and other scholarship. You are also free to propose
topics you feel well-equipped to discuss. Class discussions will center around these questions,
so try to be open-ended in your queries.
You will be allowed to skip two discussion questions (representing two readings) without
penalty. Additional missed questions will adversely affect your score.
Note: For Thursdays when a student-led discussion is scheduled, email your discussion
question to the week’s discussion leader, cc-ing me.
Student-led Class Discussion (6 %)
Each student will be assigned to lead at least a day of discussion in the class. As part of leading
the discussion, you will select one additional journal article that you feel are related to the pre-
assigned readings for the week. You can choose one of the references in the pre-assigned book
chapters, or search Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/). Your chosen study must be an
empirical work (i.e., survey or experiment). Working with me, you will decide on one reading
that best exemplifies and complements the pre-assigned readings, and it will be uploaded to
CANVAS by the Friday before the class discussion you will be leading.
Note: Leading the class discussion will involve providing hardcopies of a one- or two-page
summary of your chosen reading, and handling discussion questions from your colleagues.
No PPT is necessary. Submit your handout to CANVAS by 11:59 PM the day before your
presentation.
Theory Extension Project (57 %)
The main assignment in this class will be a theory extension project that will involve several
steps outlined below. The overall objective of this assignment is to describe an extension of the
theory that you are interested in, and design an empirical study based on your idea. Examples of
theory extension include: identifying a variable currently missing in the theory, applying the
theory to a different context, or combining different theoretical approaches to explain a
phenomenon.
    1. Research Statement (3%): Update your research statement, focusing on the topics, areas
        of advertising research, and/or aspects of human psychology that you are genuinely
        interested in. Conclude it with a potential theory or theories that you may be interested in
        investigating more during your PhD years. Refer to the list of theories in this syllabus,
        your textbook, or any other sources that you may think relevant.


                                                                                             Oh 3
   Note: You are not obligated to choose the same theory for your later assignments. In
   fact, any change or development from your initial research statement to your final
   project may be an indicator of your learning outcome.
2. Research Question (5%): The first step in the theory extension project is picking a
   research question for the project, based on one or two theories. You will submit a 2-page
   overview of the research question (double-spaced), including:
•  a description of the basic theory or theories that you intend to extend, and
•  a brief explanation of why this question is theoretically meaningful and why you believe
   it to be practically important.
   You will share your idea with your classmates and me through a brief oral presentation
   in class and receive our feedback.
3. Annotated Bibliography and Hypotheses (12%): An annotated bibliography,
   summarizing literature relevant to your project, will provide the foundation for your
   project. Based on this literature review, you will propose a set of hypotheses you want to
   empirically test. Your assignment should include:
•  a list of several potential readings that you will use in developing your literature review,
   along with a brief (4-5 sentences) summary of how each is relevant to your topic (the
   summaries should explain the basic predictions you are making and any theories or
   previous findings critical to those predictions), and
•  a set of hypotheses that are empirically testable based on your predictions.
4. Method and Measurement (5%): You will describe your current thoughts regarding the
   method and measurement you will employ to test your overarching research question
   and hypotheses. More detail is better than less, with the hopes that I can help suggest
   ways to develop your study. Your assignment should include:
•  how you will recruit participants,
•  what method you will use (e.g., survey, experiment, a single-factor experiment, a
   factorial-design experiment, etc.),
•  study procedure and/or stimulus, and
•  the definition and measurement of your variables and citations.
5. Qualtrics (2%): You will develop a complete questionnaire that is ready for actual data
   collection built upon your work on method and measurement.
6. IRB Paperwork (not required): You can complete the IRB paperwork only if you are
   interested in actual data collection within this semester. You should finish IRB training
   and submit a Financial Interest Disclosure (FID) through our website
   (https://research.utexas.edu/ors/human-subjects/). The IRB application will require you
   to submit a research proposal that includes your research topic, method, and
   questionnaire.


                                                                                                 Oh 4
    7. Final Presentation (5%): As an academic, you will be expected to share your ideas at
        conferences. The presentation in this class will be an opportunity to explain your
        research proposal to your classmates, discuss your extension of theory, and make a case
        for its theoretical and practical impact as if you were in a conference. Regardless of
        your presentation schedule, your submission is due 11:59 pm Monday Dec 3. No
        revision is allowed after submission.
    8. Research Proposal (25%): The final deliverable for the class will be a research proposal
        that (a) explains the theoretical extension that you are proposing, and (b) proposes a study
        that can test your hypotheses with a complete method section. Your final paper will
        include “article-ready” introduction, literature review, method, and references. The goal
        for this final paper is that you leave the class with a paper that could be submitted to a
        conference in the next semester after data collection and analysis.
