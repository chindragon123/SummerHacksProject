Course Description:
“The Ancient Mediterranean World” (AMW) is an introductory survey of the peoples of the ancient
Mediterranean (the Near East, North Africa, Greece, and Italy) from ca. 3000 BCE to 381 CE. It focuses
on the history, cultural identity, ideas, religions, and institutions of the diverse civilizations of these regions.
The ancient Mediterranean is an especially fascinating region to study because of the diversity of the
civilizations that emerged and developed in a relatively small geographical area. Each had its distinctive
character, but vigorous cultural exchange in the region and beyond led to the assimilation, adaptation, or
rejection (or a combination) by one culture of the ideas and practices of others. Thus, as we study a particular
civilization, a major theme will be cultural interaction and its consequences and implications for
understanding the historical development of the various cultures living in this region.
The evidence of the ancient historian is wide-ranging and includes literary texts, documents written on
papyri and inscribed on stone, artifacts (e.g. coins, vase paintings, sculpture), and more. The lectures and
discussion sections will introduce you to many of these sources and to the analytical methods of the ancient
historian, and they will give you experience interpreting these primary sources and constructing historical
arguments based upon reason and evidence.
This course carries a Global Cultures Flag.

You must attend your assigned section. You are not permitted to attend another section.
Grading and Assessment:
Your grade for the course will be determined by the following:
         3 in-class exams = 70% (exam 1 = 20%, exams 2 and 3 = 25% each)
         Discussion = 30% (quizzes = 20%, participation = 10%)
         Attendance (see below)
Exams. There are three in-class exams (see schedule below for dates). These consist of multiple choice, fill
in the blank, short response, and essay questions. The first exam is worth 20% of your final grade; the last
two exams are worth 25% each. Exams test material covered both in lecture and in discussion. While exams
focus on material covered in that regional unit, expect questions from previous course material.
Discussion. Discussion is integral to the course and your success in it. Your discussion grade is determined
by regular quizzes (20%) and participation (10%). Quizzes are short and strictly timed (ca. 2 minutes). They
begin promptly at the beginning of discussion. No exceptions. Quizzes cannot be made up, and you are not
allowed to take a quizlet once it has begun, so be on time. They test factual information pertinent to that
week’s material and in particular the readings for that day’s discussion. Your lowest quiz grade will be
dropped. Your participation grade is meant to reflect your effort and engagement with the material and the
class. If you contribute a single earth-shattering publishable response but otherwise stay silent throughout
the semester, you will receive 0 for your participation grade. If you talk constantly but in an uninformed
way about the course material, you will likewise receive 0 for your participation grade. If, however, you
demonstrate careful attention to each day’s assignment, and you contribute regularly to relevant class
discussions, you will receive 10 for your participation grade. Participation cannot be made up.
Attendance. You are allowed two unexcused absences for lecture and one unexcused absence for discussion.
Any additional unexcused absence from either lecture or discussion will result in a deduction of 1 point
from your final grade. If you come to class late, you will be counted as absent. If you leave class early, you
will be counted as absent. If you disrupt the class while present, you will be counted as absent. The
unauthorized use of a computer, tablet, or phone during class counts as a disruption. See below on
technology in the classroom.
Make-up Policy:
Excused absences must meet the University’s definition of an excused absence and be accompanied by
University-approved written documentation addressed to me for that particular hour’s absence. Prescription
                                                      2


slips, appointment reminders, an image of your severed finger, etc. do not qualify as official documentation.
Only exams may be made up; quizzes, participation, and attendance cannot be made up even in the case of
a legitimate absence. You must provide me with documentation before the date of the exam. Even if you
were legitimately sick, I will not let you make up an exam if you tell me about your absence after the exam
has been given.
Grade Scale:
A 93-100; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76;
C- 70-72; D+ 67- 69; D 63-66; D- 60-62; F 59 and below.
Grades will not be curved, scaled, or rounded up. For instance, 89.9 is a B+.
Disabilities:
UT Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with
disabilities.   For      more     information,    contact      SSD     at     512.471-6259,     or   go     to
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/. You must present me with a UT "accommodation letter"
authorizing specific accommodations as soon as possible. If your accommodation involves extra time on
graded assignments, let me know right away so we can make arrangements.
Religious Holidays:
If you need to miss a class or other required class activity for the observance of a religious holiday, you
must notify me at least 14 days in advance so we can make alternative arrangements for your absence. The
University's Religious Days Policy is online: http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/.
Behavioral Concerns:
If you are worried about the way someone is acting, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line
(BCAL) to discuss your concerns by phone. This service is provided through a partnership among the Office
of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance
Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit
http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal
Scholastic Dishonesty:
Scholastic dishonesty on any graded assignment will result in a 0 on that assignment and an F for the course.
Scholastic dishonesty includes any kind of cheating or collaboration on graded assignments (unless I specify
that an assignment is collaborative), or submitting work that is not either your own or accurately attributed
to its source. For more information, contact Student Judicial Services at 471-2841, or go to
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ acint_student.php/. Note that I will report to the SJS if I am aware of
any cheating.
iThings:
The use of computers, tablets, abacuses, phones, etc. is strictly prohibited in the classroom. However, if you
are unable to print that day’s reading, we are happy to make an exception. That said, if we merely sense the
misuse of an iThing or the existence of an active cellphone, you will be marked absent for that day and
prohibited from subsequent use of any technology.
