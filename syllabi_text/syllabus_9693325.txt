         Description: This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are
designed to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect to stretch your mental horizons to comprehend the coherence of practices,
beliefs, and histories of non-US groups.
         In the case of the Indian subcontinent, practices such as related to ‘caste’, or the pluralism
of multiple religious groups, offer complex intersectional histories that force us to develop skills
of critical reflection in the present. This course will begin with ‘caste’ and ‘religion’ in the
subcontinent, move on to the gradual consolidation of British colonialism, the redrawing of
social, economic, religious, political boundaries and identities, the growth of modern political
forms such as political parties, and end with the making of states and nations in 1947.
         The course aims: 1) to acquaint students with basic concepts and a simplified chronology
of events, people, and processes.
         2) teach students the importance of ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ sources in the
understanding of any past
         3) encourage students to think critically by exposing them to a variety of perspectives on
the past, including some key controversies around each of the themes of the course.
Requirements. On days marked ‘Read’ in the syllabus, students are required to read a
compulsory number of pages in a given text in each topic before they come to class. They will
be required to purchase/borrow/ rent the following
    1) Barbara and Thomas Metcalf, A Concise History of India, (3rd edition) Cambridge
         University Press, (2012 paperback), ISBN-13 978-1-107-67218-5
All other readings are on Canvas OR on recommended websites for particular days.
PLEASE NOTE: NO LAPTOPS/IPADS/IPHONES WILL BE ALLOWED TO STUDENTS IN
THIS CLASS.
Grading is based on attendance and class-participation (40 points), in-class mid-terms and finals
(30+30 respectively 60 points). Every student can absent themselves from one class without
needing to provide documentations. For every subsequent absence from class, professional
documentation (from police, judge, hospital, work supervisor, business-manager, job-fair
organiser) is mandatory. Emails to the instructor on the day of the class lieu of presence in
class does not count towards ‘class participation’ grades. A student who does not complete
all parts of the course work is liable to get a failing grade.


Additional credit will be given to any student who attends any of the talks organized by the
South Asian Studies Program on Thursdays, 3.30 pm to 5 pm, Meyerson Hall, Hogg
Building, and hands in a two-page report on the following class day. The schedule of talks is
available on www.austin.utexas.edu/cola/insts/southasia/events. Every two-page report carries 2
points. However, please remember that this credit is ‘additional’ and not ‘substitution’ for other
class/course work for any student.
Grading Policies: LETTER GRADES OF A, B, C, D and F will be given in this course in the
following fashion: total of 90-100= A; 89-80= B; 79-70=C; 60-69=D; 59 and below is F.
Scoring Guide :1) Attendance: 25 (punctuality + regularity). If a student appears to me to be
reading his/her phone, texting friends, reading facebook, watching a film while seated in a
classroom where I am teaching, I will deduct points from the overall grade for such
unprofessional conduct.
                  2) Class Contributions: 15. At all times, these points will be given based on your
        close reading of materials before asking questions in class or in writing. When you are
        asked to answer your peers’ questions, in oral or written form, you will be assessed on
        your ability to synthesize your reading of a document with lectures and by the end, your
        ability to cite evidence either of materials of study by page number or slide date
        accurately
                 3) Half-Term IDS, 30 (date, comprehensiveness of Information, significance of
        the term for the broader history)
                 4) Finals, 30 (10 IDs given to you in class)
        1) Do not cut and paste from the Internet, or submit any work that is not fully your own.
On suspicion of any form of cheating, plagiarism or violations of the UT Honor Code, I will
submit the written work and the errant student to disciplinary procedures of the University.
    2) Late assignments will be penalized. Medical certificates are acceptable only if you
        notify me of a prior condition before the due date of the assignment. For exams, I expect
        you to be here except in cases of dire emergency (usually medical). If you have to miss
        an exam for any reason (religious holiday, academic trip out of town, scheduled surgery,
        jury duty, etc.), you must notify me in advance.
    However, students also have the opportunity to earn extra credit (by 1 point for each session
they attend for a maximum of 5 points) by attending talks organized by the South Asia Institute
on Thursdays 3.30 pm to 5 pm in the Meyerson Conference Room, Hogg Building (next door to
Garrison Hall). After attending a talk, hand in a one-page report on what you heard, and what
you thought of what you heard. The schedule of talks is available at
http://www.utexas.edu/cola/insts/southasia/ Your instructor will be presenting ongoing
research work there on 3rd October between 3.30 and 5pm. You are welcome to attend.

         from the Division of Diversity Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259. Bring
         me a letter to that effect as early in the semester as possible, before major assignments
         are due. For everybody else, please be aware that you always have help available to you
         to deal with stresses at https://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/thrive/index.html.
