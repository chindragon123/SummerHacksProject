COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this course is to explore the scientific study of reproduction, mate choice, and sexual behavior
within evolutionary, comparative biology, and feminist biology frameworks. We will examine a wide range of
genetic, ecological, social, physiological, and behavioral aspects of human and nonhuman primate sexuality.
Starting from basic principles of evolutionary theory, we’ll consider a range of questions about sex and sexuality:
How did sexual reproduction evolve? How is biological sex determined, and is it truly binary? How do males and
females differ biologically? How does parent-offspring and sexual conflict impact human pregnancy and lactation?
We’ll also look at the role of ecology and social life in shaping human mating patterns using a variety of
ethnographic, cross-cultural, and comparative primatology materials. Do men and women differ in their sexual
strategies, and if so, how and why? What factors influence traits considered attractive? Why do humans marry
and form long-term pair-bonds--or do they? Why do we experience sexual jealousy? Throughout, examples will
be drawn primarily from both “traditional” and post-industrial human societies, archaeology, and studies of our
nonhuman primate relatives.
Objectives: After taking this course you should be able to:
  1) Understand the comparative method and how it can be applied to answer evolutionary questions.
  2) Summarize different evolutionary approaches to thinking about human behavioral ecology (evolutionary
       psychology, human behavioral ecology, feminist biology) and distinguish among such approaches.
  3) Describe the fundamentals of human and mammalian sex determination systems, including the physiological
       and genetic underpinnings of sexual differentiation.
  4) Discuss how human sexual anatomy, behavior, and mating practices are similar to and differ from those of
       other primates and other mammals
  5) Articulate evolutionary hypothesis for a given pattern of human sexual behavior (e.g., mate choice, sexual
       jealousy) and design and critique tests of that hypotheses using logic and evidence.
  6) Read and critique research from the primary literature on human sexuality, including evaluating the
       strengths and weaknesses in researchers’ methodologies and interpretations.
COURSE FORMAT AND REQUIREMENTS
This course meets 3x a week and will be structured around interactive lectures and dedicated discussion days
where you will be expected to come prepared to discuss the assigned readings. You will also be expected to work
with a group to lead a discussion day once during the semester. Thus, participation is an important part of your
grade. It is difficult to participate if you are not present in class and so attendance will be included in the grade.
Readings: The assigned textbook is Evolution and Human Sexual Behavior by PG Gray and JR Garcia (available
in the bookstore and through Amazon, ~$21.95). We won’t use the textbook every week, however, so additional
readings will be posted in Canvas or through library e-journals.
Canvas: I will have separate Canvas pages for each lecture day where I will post links to the assigned reading,
any videos discussed in lecture, and a pdf summary of lecture slides.

                                  ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING POLICIES
Grades for the semester will be based on the following components:
     Exam 1 …………… …………… 10%                                    Discussion & participation ……………..             10%
     Exam 2 …………… …………… 20%                                    Informal reading responses …………….              10%
     Exam 3 …………………………. 20%                                    Response/critique paper ...................... 15%
     Discussion leadership ....…….. 10%                        Attendance ………………………………….                       5%
Final grades will be calculated using the following scale:
A = 93.5 - 100                  B = 83.5 - 86.49                 C = 73.5 - 76.49                D = 63.5 - 66.49
A- = 89.5 - 93.49               B- = 79.5 - 83.49                C- = 69.5 - 73.49               D- = 59.5 - 63.49
B+ = 86.5 - 89.49               C+ = 76.5 - 79.49                D+ = 66.5 - 69.49               F = 0 - 59.49
 Exams (50%). There will be 3 non-cumulative exams during class time which will cover all lecture material and
   assigned readings. Exams will be objective format (e.g. true/false, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short-
   answer). Study guides will be posted on Canvas 3-5 days before the exam, but you will need to complete an
   online practice quiz to gain access.
   Make-up exams will be given ONLY with documented proof of dire emergency or illness. You must contact me
   within three days of a missed exam to qualify for a make-up.
 Discussion leadership (10%). Discussions are fun and useful ways to help students formulate and articulate
   opinions, ensure a grasp of the material, provide an opportunity to ask questions, and deal with issues arising
   from the class material. Discussions also help ensure a collegial class atmosphere!
   You will each be expected to lead discussion for one of the designated discussion sections with 2-3 other
   classmates. A discussion leader should try to facilitate discussion with classmates by reading the material
   carefully and bringing questions, scenarios, ideas, etc. to the table. This is your chance to try your hand at
   teaching! You can try breaking the class into smaller group discussions, play a game, make slides, organize a
   debate – be creative! You are encouraged to come see me in office hours to chat about your ideas.
   You and your fellow leaders will be graded on how well you facilitate discussion of the readings, and you will
   also grade each other’s participation in organizing the discussion session. Some students may feel more
   comfortable participating in discussion if they can prepare prior to class. Therefore, leaders are expected to
   post some discussion prompts on the Canvas message board at least one day before the class period.
 Discussion & participation (10%): Participation is an important component of this class, and you are expected
   to come prepared having done the readings. All lectures will be interactive and often will involve in-class
   activities, where you will be asked to think about material we have been working through and to prepare
   questions or responses to prompts. Your written responses (for example, “one-minute-essays” on concepts
   that we have covered) will be collected and used to assess attendance and participation.
   On days where articles have been assigned for class discussion, the job of the class is to discuss! Thus, you
   are expected to come to class prepared and ready to participate. Discussion is not always easy, but it is an
   important skill to master. It’s okay to be wrong!! It’s okay to be shy!! But at some point you have to get over
   it, and start talking. For some of you this will be a challenge. Rise to it! You are expected to make at least one
   contribution to the discussion per session. You can also earn participation points by responding to the tweet-
   style posts of other students on the discussion board for designated discussion days.
 Informal reading responses (10%): There will be 12 reading responses over the semester corresponding with
   guest lectures and discussion days. Responses are due by 11:59 PM on the day prior to the class discussion
   and are submitted through Canvas. Late assignments will be accepted until the start of class but the grade will
   be docked 10%. After class starts, no late assignments will be accepted.
 Prompts will be provided on Canvas, but will typically involve:
Veilleux – Sex and Human Nature                                                                                  2


               •    very briefly answering four questions (1. What is one thing you found interesting? 2. What is one
                    thing that seems clearly true/correct? 3. What is one thing you found problematic? 4. What is one
                    question you have?)
               •    Submitting one tweet-style post to the Canvas discussion board summarizing what you thought
                    the major point of the readings were.
 Response/critique paper (15%). About 2/3rds of the way through the semester, I will assign each student a
    recent article published in the primary literature in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior (see the journal
    website http://www.ehbonline.org for an early overview of the kinds of research published there). In a minimum
    TWO-PAGE, maximum THREE-PAGE single-spaced paper (10-pt font, 1” margins), you will need to summarize
    the main evolutionary argument or hypothesis being examined in the article and the data the researcher(s) use
    to do so. Then, using at least two additional reference sources from the primary literature, you will need to
    discuss/critique the methodology, data analysis, and conclusions of the study. In your critique, you will need
    to identify what kind of evolutionary approach the researchers followed. Your response should also address
    the following questions:
       • Are the data collected appropriate to address the hypothesis? Why or why not?
       • Are the conclusions or implications the researchers highlight in their discussion appropriate and justified?
       • How could the study be improved or expanded upon?
       •    What would make it a more convincing study?
       The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate your [1] comprehension of the study being critiqued, [2]
       your ability to evaluate the researcher(s)’ experimental design and interpretation, [3] your creativity and
       understanding of evolutionary thinking in designing ways to improve upon or extend the study, and [4] your
       ability to express yourself clearly and succinctly in writing using appropriate logic, organization, grammar,
       and syntax. To give yourselves an idea of what I will be looking for in grading this assignment, I will post the
       Paper Critique Rubric on Canvas.
       You will also be expected to compose two “tweets” to post on a Canvas discussion board, one summarizing
       the study and the second giving your overall opinion of it. A final component of your grade for this assignment
       will be to respond in tweet-form to the tweets of at least two other students in the class.
 Attendance (5%). Attendance will be taken randomly throughout the semester, often via in-class activities.
    Missed quizzes/in-class activities cannot be made up.
Late work. Except where discussed previously in the Assignments and Grading Policies or specific assignment
    handouts, late work will be accepted but will incur a penalty of 10% for every day late.
 Exam Regrading Policy: Grade disputes must be turned in to me in writing within 1 week of when the exam is
    returned. The student must include a 1 page explanation per question of why (s)he thinks that his/her answer
    is correct. Simple errors in addition can be corrected immediately. Students wishing to appeal a grade for one
    of the writing assignments, have 1 week to appeal their grade by turning in a 1 page explanation of why (s)he
    thinks that his/her paper should be regraded.
                                                     EXPECTATIONS
Classroom expectations:
• I expect you to come to class prepared by having done the readings.
• I expect you to treat others with respect. This includes putting phones on silent and no texting during class.
• We will sometimes discuss sensitive topics, and the classroom is a space for free and open inquiry and for the
      critical evaluation of ideas. I expect you to be thoughtful and considerate when interacting with other students.
      Students and instructors have an obligation to create an educational atmosphere of mutual trust and respect
      in which differences of opinion can be subjected to deliberate and reasonable examination without animus.

• I expect you to be on time for class and remain in the classroom for the duration of the lecture. If you need to
      leave early for a particular class, please let me know beforehand.
• If you have trouble hearing or concentrating on the lecture because of distractions around you, quietly ask those
      responsible for the distraction to stop. If the distraction continues, please let me know. Disruptive classroom
      behavior may be subject to disciplinary sanction.
In turn, I will:
• Post assigned readings and assignments to Canvas in a timely manner (at least 2 weeks ahead of time)
• Return assignments/exams in a timely manner (~within 1-2 weeks).
• Treat students and student opinions with respect.
                                             INSTRUCTOR PERSPECTIVE
We are going to cover a LOT of material in this course, much of which may be very new to many of you, especially
those without some theoretical background experience in evolutionary biology, biological anthropology or
psychology. That said, the study of human sexual behavior and reproduction is inherently fascinating, and is a
subject area where everyone has some experience and opinion. I strongly encourage you to articulate your
thoughts and ideas about the material freely and fully. NONE of the material we will cover is beyond the grasp of
any motivated and enthusiastic student willing to put in the effort, and I urge you all to throw yourselves
wholeheartedly into this fascinating field.
I want you all to feel comfortable enough to pose questions, ask me for clarification, interrupt with ideas and
comments, and offer your own opinions or challenges to the material I am presenting. In fact, part of your grade
in this class will DEPEND on your willingness to do this both in with one another and with the class, through both
in-class and online discussions and posts – so do not be shy!
Also, this is my first time teaching this course, so I look forward to hearing your thoughts throughout the semester
on the subjects we cover, materials we use, and format of the class.
Before we begin, you should be aware that in this class we will take a decidedly EVOLUTIONARY perspective on
human and nonhuman animal behavior and sexuality, and you will be assessed in part on your ability to grasp,
articulate, employ, and evaluate evolutionary/adaptationist thinking using scientific evidence and logic. If you find
yourself resistant to evolutionary thinking arguments for philosophical, religious, or other reasons, then this may
not be a class for you.
Finally, I would love to see ALL students learn the material well and receive good grades in this class. So, please
come see me in office hours or make an individual appointment with me immediately if you are having any undue
difficulty with the material or any problems or concerns you want to discuss.

                                               COURSE POLICIES
Statement on Learning Success and Accessibility. Your success in this class is important to me. We will all
   need accommodations because we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you
   from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to
   meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student
   resources available through UT (see below).
   In compliance with the UT Austin policy and equal access laws, I am available to discuss appropriate academic
   accommodations that may be required for students with disabilities. Requests for academic accommodations
   are to be made during the 1st 3 weeks of the semester, except for unusual circumstances, so arrangements
   can be made. Students are encouraged to register with Student Disability Services to verify their eligibility for
   appropriate accommodations (see below).
Exam taking policies. On exam days, students will only be allowed to take a pen/pencil to their seat. All
   backpacks, book bags, purses, phones, etc. must be left at the front of the classroom. Hats with rims are not
   permitted to be worn.
Social media/discussion groups. Students are welcome to participate in online forums for study and discussion
   (e.g., a course Facebook page). However, Dr. Veilleux must be invited and permitted to join any such forum in
   order to monitor content. Please note that sharing information about an exam with a student who has not yet
   taken an exam will be considered cheating, regardless of the means by which the information is shared (e.g.,
   verbally, on a web page, via email, via text, etc.). Students who observe cheating via electronic media are
   encouraged to inform Dr. Veilleux.
Absences. Attendance will be taken randomly through the semester, and attendance is necessary for in class
   activities. The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious holidays or extenuating
   circumstances due to an emergency.
Personal Pronoun Preference. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to
   individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender,
   gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I
   will gladly honor your request to address you by a name different than what appears on the roster, and by the
   gender pronouns you use. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make
   appropriate changes to my records.
Religious Holy Days. Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If you miss
   an examination, work assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day, you will be
   given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. It is the policy
   of The University of Texas at Austin that you must notify each of your instructors at least fourteen (14)
   days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a religious holy days.
Academic Integrity. Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As
   a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold
   academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not
   your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of
Veilleux – Sex and Human Nature                                                                              7


    plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
    understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following
    web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
In this class, cheating and plagiarism includes (but is not limited to):
• Copying from another student's exams, in class assignment, or from any electronic device.
• Collaborating, without authorization, with another person during an exam or in preparing academic work (e.g.,
    summaries for In Class Activity assignments or Ecological Profiles).
• Copy/pasting information from sources into your assignments (you MUST use your own words to paraphrase
    the information and cite the source)
Any student found cheating (including plagiarizing) will receive a zero for the assignment, be dropped 1
letter grade for the final course grade, and be referred to the Dean of Students.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND RESOURCES
Q Drop Policy. If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-
    drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed
    six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
    http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
University Resources for Students
Services for Students with Disabilities. This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities,
    and abilities. If there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have
    medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building
    needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment for
    all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain
    the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-
    471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
Counseling and Mental Health Center. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well,
    exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
    achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not
    alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience
    is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
    depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html
The Sanger Learning Center. Did you know that more than one-third of UT undergraduate students use the
    Sanger Learning Center each year to improve their academic performance? All students are welcome to take
    advantage of Sanger Center’s classes and workshops, private learning specialist appointments, peer academic
    coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses in 15 different subject areas. For more information, please

Title IX Reporting. Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded
educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
    1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
    2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become
       involved in a Title IX investigation.
    3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters,”
which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible
Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-
one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask
whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without
making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting
options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
