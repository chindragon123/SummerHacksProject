This upper division course explores the distinctive structures and behavior of East Asian
political economies, with special emphasis on Japan, China, and South and North Korea.
After examining contending explanations of the East Asian Miracle, we trace the postwar
political-economic histories of each of these countries, with an eye to the following
themes: How do the relationships between states and markets in East Asia differ from
comparable relationships in the West?; How have East Asian countries influenced one
another’s growth trajectories?; Why is corruption such a prominent feature of the
political-economic landscapes of East Asia, and what are its costs and benefits?; What
have been some of the social repercussions of growth in the region?; Finally, how have
globalization and recent economic crises affected East Asian growth models?
This course carries two flags. In keeping with the Global Cultures Flag, we explore
course themes with an eye to the cultural and institutional differences between East Asia
and the West.
Prerequisites:
Students with 6 or more hours of Government coursework have priority access to this
course. Some knowledge of East Asia and/or comparative politics/political economy is
recommended but not required.
Course Requirements:
1. Quizzes on required readings (approx. 6):                         10%
        Lowest quiz score will be dropped from semester total
2. Participation in class discussions:                               10%
3. Two short writing assignments on required readings:               20%
        3-4 double-spaced pages each:
        #1 due Sept. 17
        #2 due Oct. 8
4. Research paper proposal:                                          10%
                                                                                          1


         2 double-spaced pages + annotated bibliography
         Due Oct. 17

Readings:
No books have been assigned for this course. With the exception of Internet sources that
students can access directly, required readings are posted under Modules on the Canvas
site for this course.
Note on Research Papers:
Since this course carries the Writing Flag, we will spend lots of time developing
advanced research and writing skills. You will write three essays this semester, the most
of important of which will be a 12- to 15-page research paper on a topic of your choice—
including East/Southeast Asian countries and/or political-economic themes that are not
addressed in the lectures and required readings. After submitting a 2-page proposal +
preliminary annotated bibliography, you will complete two drafts of your paper. The first
draft is due 72 hours before your scheduled in-class paper presentation, and the final draft
at noon on Thursday, December 12. Only the second draft will receive a formal grade—
but that grade will reflect the quality of your first draft, how effectively you incorporated
critical feedback into your revisions, whether you submitted both drafts on time, etc.
Class Guidelines:
         1. This class has a discussion component, which means you are expected to ask
questions during lectures, participate proactively in class discussions, and comment at the
end of the semester on other students’ research presentations. We will devote a
significant amount of time in class to analyzing the required readings, so it is in your
interest to come to class prepared.
         2. PowerPoint presentations will be posted on Canvas in advance of each
session. The presentations are designed to provide you with rough outlines of basic
concepts and themes. Since class discussions will build on lectures and past
readings/discussions, it is a good idea to take detailed notes during class.
         3. Quizzes will be announced in advance of the targeted class and administered at
12:30 sharp. Makeup quizzes are not allowed, but you will receive a handicap: at the
end of the semester, your lowest score will be dropped from your semester quiz grade.
         4. Students with disabilities are welcome to request appropriate
accommodations. Please contact Services for Students with Disabilities (512-471-6259/
ssd@austin.utexas.edu) and the instructor for further information.
                                                                                             2


         5. Students guilty of academic misconduct (e.g., cheating on a quiz or
plagiarizing a writing assignment) will receive a “0” for that assignment. No exceptions.
Please review the following tutorial of what plagiarism is and how to avoid it:
http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/avoidplagiarism.html
         6. Laptops and cell phones are not permitted for use during class.
         7. All assignments must be completed on schedule. Late written submissions
will be penalized 5% per day. You are eligible for special accommodation if you fall ill
or encounter a personal emergency, but please alert me to your situation before—rather
than after—an assignment is due.
         8. Please arrive for class on time and inform me in advance of unavoidable
absences, late arrivals, and early departures.
         9. Take advantage of my office hours! Most importantly, you should see me
periodically for individualized instruction on your research projects.

Sept. 3, 5 & 10: Demystifying the East Asian “Economic Miracle”
       ** Questions for first essay assignment distributed Sept. 10; due in class on
       Sept. 17.
       After briefly summarizing key events in the postwar political economies of East
       Asia, we review critical assessments of the region’s so-called economic miracle.
       Why “miracle”? And why do scholars seem to disagree so strongly about its
       causes?

       **Questions for second essay assignment distributed Oct. 3; due in class on
       Oct. 8.
       As far as the “East Asian Miracle” is concerned, Japan was there first. From
       the late 1950s to the 1970s, the country experienced spectacular growth rates;
       by the early 1980s, it was the world’s second largest economy. This unit
                                                                                      4


        explores the debates surrounding some of the potential causes (e.g.,
        “Developmentalism”) and consequences (e.g., structural corruption) of Japan’s
        rapid growth model. We then examine some of the reasons for Japan’s sluggish
        growth rates since the early 1990s and its ongoing struggle to introduce
        structural reforms, and debate whether the current Japanese experience should
        be interpreted as the norm for all post-industrial economies.

        ** Paper proposals due in class on Thurs., Oct. 17.
        The story of South Korea’s economic successes since the mid-1960s raises some
        intriguing questions about the sources and patterns of rapid economic growth
        in East Asia. How, and to what extent, did the Japanese model of
        Developmentalism influence South Korea’s growth trajectory? What does
        corruption look like in the South Korean political economy, and how does it
        compare to that of Japan? Finally, does the fact that South Korea’s most
        spectacular economic accomplishments occurred under the dictatorship of Park
                                                                                       5
