Course Description:
You've been jumping through hoops since you got to UT. Getting into the university itself, getting into the Advertising and Public Relations programs, getting into
various sequences, getting internships, and so on. Every step felt like you were jumping through ever-smaller hoops.
Welcome, then, to the final flaming circle: Integrated Campaigns. This course integrates everything you've learned so far -- no more silos.
In this class, we're all creative, and we're all businesspeople. The only thing that differs is our area of expertise. I ask you to please respect each other, and what
each of us brings to the table.
Because you're putting things you already know to practical use, there are no traditional tests or lectures or papers in this class--just campaign plans. Truly
stunning, professional-level plans.

This class is where it gets real: you create work for a real client, and give them a real presentation of your real campaign ideas. This is going to take a lot of real
sweat. You have a semester to do all of this, which believe it or not is quite generous in the real world.
All great campaigns come from an insight--your job will be work together to find it, then bring it to life. You are expected to take a 360-degree integrated view of all
the tools at your disposal for reaching customers.
This also takes integrating yourselves: using teamwork like never before to solve real problems. Teamwork is part of your grade, in fact.
We'll also have readings and discussions, all to help you create the best campaign plan. Realize that your plans will change and evolve--constant revision and
flexibility are both very necessary in this business.
I will work as your director, guiding and pushing you to do better, smarter work. You will be graduating soon, and I want you to have all the skills you need to jump
into a real cubicle somewhere and start earning real money.
Course Components.
Classroom. We’ll use this time in several ways; such as discussing campaigns in general, and discussing topics relevant your own work as it evolves. On certain
days, your team or subgroup may instead meet with me at a specified portion of our regular class time.
Campaigns. The core part of this course—and your grade—are the campaigns you create with your teammates. These projects will be presented to the class as
well as clients and guests. You all work together on this, and you all receive the same grade. This will be graded on insight as well as execution and ruthless
attention to details.
Presentation. You’ll present your final project, as a team. This means you’ll have to communicate your ideas orally and visually.
Teamwork. Your ability to work as part of a team is perhaps the most important factor in succeeding in this industry, besides raw talent and tenacity. Therefore,
your ability to work with others is factored into your final grade—in fact, your teammates will assign you this grade, anonymously.
Independent Inquiry. This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are designed to engage you in the process of inquiry over the
course of a semester, providing you with the opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related to your major. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from the independent investigation into your client and marketing situation, and presentation of your own work.
Grades:
Here’s how your final course grade will be calculated:
30% = Finished Campaign 1 (group grade)
60% = Finished Campaign 2 (group grade)
10% = Teamwork (individual grade)
100%= Total
Final letter grades are calculated according to these cutoffs—no exceptions:
A = 94 to 100 A- = 90 to <94 B+ = 87 to <90 B = 87 to <84 B- = 84 to <80 C+ = 80 to <77 C = 77 to <74 C- = 74 to <70 D+ = 70 to <67 D = 67 to <64 D- = 64
to <61 F = 61 to 0
Rules:
Attendance + Late Work
As a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry, you are expected to complete every section and project on time--no exceptions. All projects are due at the
date and time indicated on the Class Calendar.
