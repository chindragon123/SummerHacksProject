COURSE DESCRIPTION
       From the time of slavery when their marriages and families were not recognized to the present
       where many are considered pathological, African American families have been under almost
       constant attack in the United States. Yet, a close examination of the changing African
       American family in the United States does not demonstrate its pathology but rather its
       resilience and adaptability to societal constraints. In this class, we will examine how African
       Americans managed to maintain a sense of family from the time of slavery to the present trend
       of mass incarceration. We will analyze how different perspectives on gender, race/ethnicity,
       sexual orientation, social class and the family have been applied to African American families.
       In addition, we will discuss the importance of single parent and multigenerational households,
       extended family, fictive kin and the entire community in raising African American children.
       Finally, we will critique and evaluate the impact of the portrayal of African American families
       in academic research, politics, and the media.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
       It is my hope that students will set their own goals for the course. Nevertheless, by the end of
       the course, all students should be able to:
       1) Analyze existing theories on families and how they relate to our understanding of a family
            in general and African American families in particular.
       2) Appreciate how African American families have adapted and maintained a sense of family
            despite the inequities and structural constraints they have experienced throughout U.S.
            history.
       3) Recognize how historical experiences shape the lives of contemporary African American
            families.
       4) Critique orally and in writing representations of African American families in different
            genre and articulate how such depictions have influenced African American families’ lived
            experiences.
       5) Articulate the current social issues and inequities faced by African American families.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS
       Class Participation (20%). I believe that learning is an interactive sport. Therefore class
       participation is critical to the success of the course for the class will consist mainly of guided
       discussion with brief lectures as needed. Students are expected to attend every class on time
                                                       1


prepared to discuss the materials assigned for that date. Students are allowed two unexcused
absences without penalty. However, students’ class participation grade will decrease with each
additional absence. If a student has more than 10 unexcused absences, they will automatically
fail the course. Finally, peer review (50% of participation grade) is an important part of the
class. Students are expected to provide the following peer reviews: 1) written feedback on 2-3
classmates’ first position papers; 2) written feedback on fellow group members’ abstracts; and
3) evaluations of fellow group members’ contribution to the group’s edited volume introduction
and presentation.
Position Papers (20%). Writing is an essential way to assist students in engaging in the
reading materials on a deeper level. Students are required to write four 700-800 word essays in
Canvas summarizing and responding to the major argument(s) of the readings. Students are
required to revise their first position paper based on the feedback provided by their peer review
team and the instructor. The total number of position papers submitted will be four original and
one revised paper.
Edited Volume and Presentation (Total: 60%). It is important to understand how past
depictions of African American families influence current representations and the lived
experiences of African American families. Students will work with a group to develop an
edited volume (a collection of work with each chapter written by a different author) on African
American families in a specific historical time period. The volume will use theory and research
to understand the portrayals of African American families within the time period and how they
may have impacted African American families during that era and the present. The volume
should also explore how the representation of African American families relates to traditional
views of family.
         Abstract and Annotated Bibliography (10%). Students are required to submit a 500
         word abstract of their individual chapter for their edited volume. The abstract should
         briefly explain the genre under study, the theories that will be explored, and the
         potential impact of the chosen portrayal of African American families. The abstract will
         include an annotated bibliography (50 word summary each) of at least 5 outside
         sources.
         Revised Abstract and Annotated Bibliography (5%). Students will submit a revised
         abstract based on the instructor and group member’s feedback.
         Group Presentation (10%). Each group will be responsible for giving a 40-50 minute
         PowerPoint presentation on their edited volume. Presentation slides should be posted to
         Canvas by 10pm the day before the class presentation. Presentation grades will be based
         on the instructor’s overall group grade and each member’s individual contribution as
         determined by fellow group members.
         Edited Volume Introduction (10%). Students will work with their group to write a 4-5
         page double-spaced introduction to their edited volume. The introduction should outline
         the central unifying argument(s) of the volume. Each student should also provide a
         paragraph summary of their chapter that will be included in the introduction. Final
         grades will be based on the overall group grade and each member’s individual
         contribution as determined by fellow group members.
                                               2


                Chapter of Edited Volume (25%). Each student is expected to complete an 8-10 page
                double spaced chapter for the edited volume created by their group. The chapter will
                use theory and research to analyze the portrayal of African American families in a
                particular genre (literature, film, television, social science research, etc.) during the
                specific time period that is the focus of the edited volume. Each chapter should
                represent a different genre so students must work with their group members to
                determine individual genre selections. Each chapter should consider the following: 1)
                how the genre portrays African American families; 2) how said depiction reflects the
                lived experiences of African American families during the chosen period; 3) how the
                portrayal relates to traditional views of the family; and 4) the potential short and long-
                term impact of such representations on African Americans during that time and the
                present.
