Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be:
         1. conversant with the application of sociological theory and data to issues and problems in
               sport and physical activity;
         2. competent to research topics in sport sociology using the sport sociology literature;
         3. capable of examining and interpreting their own sport experiences using sociological
               concepts and methods;
         4. able to apply sport sociology to the analysis of sport policy.
Rationale
As a result of its escalating significance in contemporary society, sport has increasingly become a
topic of public debate and policy concern. Sport sociology provides tools through which to develop
informed insight into the matters that are at the foundation of contemporary policies and debates
about sport. This course introduces students to the uses of sociological ideas and methods in the
analysis of contemporary sport issues. A number of contemporary issues in sport are introduced in
order to explore the application of sociological thinking, including: socialization, deviance,
violence, gender, ethnicity, social class, business, media, politics, education, and religion. Students
are provided opportunities to develop perspectives on these issues that are informed by sociological
research and theory. In order to explore the application of sociology to sport, students explore their
own sport experiences using sociological concepts and methods. Students also learn to use the sport
sociology literature to deepen insight into sport problems. In addition, students have an opportunity
to apply sociological reasoning to the development of sport policy.
Prerequisite
Students must have attained upper division or graduate standing in order to enroll for this course.

Design of Assignments
Assignments are designed to provide students with an opportunity to apply concepts and methods
from the readings, lectures, and class activities. Students are expected to integrate material from the
lectures, readings, and class discussions when preparing their assignments. Requirements for each
assignment will be posted on canvas and discussed in class. Assignments are to be turned in on
canvas by the due date, unless otherwise specified. Assignments received after that time will be
considered late and will have 10% deducted during each 24 hour period.
Grading of Assignments
Assignments will be assessed using the following criteria:
              • quality of writing and presentation
              • application of methods and concepts from readings, lectures, and class activities
              • synthesis and integration of ideas and insights
              • clarity and logical order of ideas
              • creativity and critical thought
Examination Content
The exams will cover material from lectures, readings, and class activities, with an emphasis on the
readings.
COURSE ADMINISTRATION AND EXPECTATIONS
    1. To be eligible to pass this course, students are required to complete all assignments and
         exams at the time they are due or scheduled. Students are also expected to contribute
         fully to any group or partner assignments. Failure to complete any assignment or exam
         is grounds for failure of the course.
    2. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
         penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
         University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of
         the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further
         information,       visit     the      Student Judicial    Services      web       site        at

    3. At the beginning of the semester, students with disabilities who need academic
         accommodations should notify the instructor by presenting a letter prepared by the
         Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with
         Disabilities, 471-6259, http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/
    4. By UT Austin policy, students must notify the instructor of impending absence at least
         fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a
         class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy
         day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable
         time after the absence.
    5. Honor Code -- The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning,
         discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member
         of the University is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust,
         fairness,        and         respect     toward         peers         and          community.
         (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/events/sjs_honorcode.php)
    6. The student should retain a copy of work that is submitted, and should retain graded
         assignments when they are returned. Students must be able to produce a copy of all work
         upon request.
    7. Submission deadlines will be strictly enforced. Extensions will only be granted on
         medical or compassionate grounds and will not be otherwise granted except in the most
         extreme circumstances. A request for extension must be made in writing (this can be
         done via email) to the instructor and must be approved by the instructor prior to the due
         date of the assignment or exam. An extension, if granted, will be provided to the student
         in writing only.
    8. From time-to-time, the instructor may award an “extra credit” point for satisfactory work
         done during a class exercise or for successful completion of out-of-class volunteer
         opportunities. No other “extra credit” will be available at any time or for any reason.
   ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION
   Attendance is a critical component of your success in this course. It is important for your
   exposure to, and retention of, materials covered in the readings. In addition, it provides you with
   the opportunity to contribute to our class discussions and to help formulate ideas for assignments.
   Material covered in class will be incorporated into assignments and included on the midterms and
   final exam. It is expected that you will attend and participate in all classes.
  POLICY FOR LATE OR MISSED WORK/EXAMS
   Students are expected to have all assignments completed on the announced dates and times.
   No late work may be turned in unless the professor has given prior approval in writing. All
   assigned work must be submitted via canvas unless otherwise specified. For every day an
   assignment is late it drops a letter grade. Students excused for athletic events, travel, religious
   purposes, etc. should make every effort to turn in their assigned work before leaving. It is not
   acceptable to email your work so it is on time unless prior permission has been given. If you
   are struggling with uploading your assignment, you are urged to contact ITS at 475-9400 for
                                                                                                     page 3 of 5

   assistance. Give yourself adequate time to submit your work in case you have technical
   difficulties.
   A missed exam is not acceptable. If you are ill, or might be absent for any reason, you
   must notify the professor before the exam is given. There will be no make-up exams for
   those absent during an exam. A missed exam results in a zero for that exam. No
   exceptions.
   ACADEMIC DISHONESTY
   Students are reminded that matters of academic dishonesty are treated seriously by the
   university and may result in failure in the class and possible expulsion from the university. In
   particular, students should use care in the writing of their papers. For instance, do not copy
   sentences and passages verbatim from others without placing them in quotes and providing
   proper citations. Ideas and theories must also be properly cited if you paraphrase from another
   person’s text. It goes without saying that it is a breach of the academic code to purchase
   papers on the Internet or to turn in work written by someone else. You will be submitting your
   papers using SafeAssign which will automatically search and report the percentage of
   plagiarism found in your paper. SafeAssign searches a database of papers found on the
   internet and papers submitted by previous students - if you submit a paper containing
   plagiarized passages from a previous student’s paper or even your own paper for another
   course, SafeAssign will be able to detect it. Bottom line: do your own work and properly cite
   any ideas or words that are not your own.
GRADING
Grades for the course will be based on the weighted aggregation of scores for the assignments and
exams. Final grades will be assigned as follows:
     A {92.5-100%}                             A- {89.5-92.49%}
     B+ {86.5-89.49}                           B {82.5-86.49%}
      B- {79.5-82.49%}                         C+ {76.5-79.49%}
     C      {72.5-76.49%}                      C- {69.5-72.49%}
