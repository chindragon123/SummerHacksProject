Description: This inquiry-driven course proceeds via two trajectories: 1) an analysis of social
groups using digital methods and 2) a process of self-reflection focused on technological
mediations of experience. The goal is for students to develop and deploy techniques of
observation and analysis for making sense of communities online, while also taking stock of how
our self-identities are shaped by algorithms and various tracking technologies. We begin by
thinking about attention—what do we focus on, for how long, and with what affects? Attention is
more than a personal matter; it has many collective forms and dimensions. We’ll consider how
we value some forms of attention and deride others, depending on social contexts and cultural
sensibilities. Then we’ll sift through the layers of technological mediation that alternately
facilitate, channel, or diffract our abilities to attend to relationships, objects, and the world
around us. With these patterns and tendencies established, we’ll analyze how media systems and
technological infrastructures intentionally organize and mine collective forms of attention—
online, certainly, but increasingly in real-world settings. We will sample various ethnographic
techniques and methods—digital and traditional—then try these out in developing analytical
accounts of the cultures of technologies (publics) that permeate social worlds today. We will
conclude with some reflections on how the human and the social are being actively redefined
today. The aim of this course is to encourage new forms of intellectual engagement;
technological expertise is not required.
Procedure: Our core process will be to think by writing, so some form of writing through guided
exercises will be due for each class session. Initially, these will take the form of lists and
unstructured notes, but as the semester progresses the writing assignments will have greater
focus and structure. There are two basic modes of writing in this course: journaling and field
reporting. In the first, you will mainly engage in reflecting on your experiences online or in
dealing with digital materials. In the second, you will progress through stages of social analysis
by developing field notes, then working these into more coherent field reports, and finally into
developed accounts of online publics or social worlds. Most of our in-class time will be spent on
people reading aloud what they have written. I expect people to listen attentively and politely.
Final projects will be presented to the class over our last three sessions.
Grading: These writings and in-class readings and presentations will all be recorded as
completion grades that can only be submitted on the due date in class. Attendance is mandatory,
though reasonable absences will be excused if you notify me as soon as possible. Journal
exercises and entries = 20%; Field notes = 10%; Field reports = 30%; Final projects = 40% (10%
for workshopping and 30% for finished presentation). There are no make-up work options in this
course.

Syllabus as a Living Document:
This syllabus is subject to change as the semester unfolds, as our discussions develop and your
thinking and writing advance. Adjustments are likely and will hopefully reflect your feedback on
our progress. I will announce changes in class and post syllabus updates to Canvas, so pay
attention and stay current with class discussions and writing. Most readings are available online
by following these links; for academic articles I will post a PDF when necessary. If you have
trouble accessing an article, let me know immediately—others will likely encounter the same
problem. But also please use your initiative to locate readings as necessary; it’s good practice in
honing digital skills.
Tech-etiquette: Despite much research that shows laptops and phones are a distraction in the
classroom, this is a technology course. You are welcome to use such devices but you must
demonstrate your cognizance that they are designed exactly to distract and absorb your attention.
When people are reading, refrain from using these devices; also, I will call on people who seem
adrift online. If tech-usage becomes rude and obnoxious, I will resort to drastic measures such as
discounting the assignment turned in that day.
Expertise: I invite your expertise in improving this course. My digital literacy is fairly limited.
Please offer suggestions on materials that may enhance our discussions and exercise, and provide
feedback on my approach to this course, with suggestions for additional topics or considerations.
Thanks in advance!
