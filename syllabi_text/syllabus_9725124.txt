This course will offer a broad survey of Japanese cinema focusing on fictional feature films and also
including early silent, documentary, and anime (animated films). The goals of this course are: to gain a
familiarity with and appreciation for Japanese films and culture, to learn the basic history of Japanese
cinema, to acquire the necessary vocabulary and tools for analyzing films as cinematic texts, and to
develop critical thinking skills when viewing, discussing, and writing about film. This class requires no
background in Japanese language, film, or history; all films are subtitled in English. Classes will include a
lecture component, but will be heavily focused on whole class and small group discussions. Your consistent
attendance and active participation are essential to the success of this class and your grade in it.
Format for class and screenings:
The basic format will be as follows: each Tuesday, we will watch a new film beginning at 5 p.m. in RLP
1.104. In Wednesday’s class, we will discuss the film, our reactions to it, the key issues it raises, etc. as an
entire class and in small groups. For the following Monday’s class, most weeks you will be assigned to read
an article or two that relates to this film and/or the issues it raises, and we will discuss the film in the context
of these readings. Pop quizzes will often be held at the beginnings of class on either day to make sure that
you’ve completed the viewings/readings and are in attendance. These quizzes and frequent in-class
assignments individually or in groups will also help you develop the necessary skills of film analysis. No
makeups allowed, but your two lowest scores for this category will be automatically dropped.
A note about screenings: Watching the films together with an audience in a theater setting as they were
designed to be watched is highly recommended and guaranteed to be more fun than watching alone on
your iPhone. If you have a compelling reason for why you cannot attend, please let the TA know and you
will need to watch these films on your own. As much as possible, we will put them on reserve for re-
watching at the Fine Arts Library (in-house viewing only). Some of the films may not otherwise be available.
Required Viewings, Readings, & Materials:
     ● All films listed with a call number on schedule below are available for re-viewing at Fine Arts Library
       (DFA, 3rd floor). Others only shown during screening times and/or in class so it’s important not to
       miss those sessions. Some also avail. on Kanopy through UT library: https://utexas.kanopy.com/
     ● Required readings will be posted on Canvas under Files as PDFs or as web links.
     ● You will need to purchase the following materials and bring them with you to class:
          o A notebook that is dedicated to your film viewing notes and lecture/discussion notes. You will
               need your notes for in-class assignments, discussions, and the occasional open-book quiz.
          o Feel free to use a laptop if you find it helps with note taking for either lecture/discussion and/or
               film screenings, but surfing the web, chatting on Facebook, etc., are not allowed in class.
          o A packet of 3″X5″ index cards. You’ll need to use your index cards for all pop quizzes or the
               quiz will not be graded. Quizzes will not be returned, but the answers will be given orally
               immediately following the quiz and grades will be posted on Canvas.

                                                                                                     Updated 8-22-19
Grading Policy
Grades are assigned as follows: 93-100 = A; 90-92.9 = A-; 87-89.9 = B+; 83-86.9 = B; 80-82.9 = B-; 77-79.9
= C+; 73-76.9 = C; 70-72.9 = C-; 67-69.9 = D+; 63-66.9 = D; 60-62.9 = D-; below 60 = F. As a rule, I do not
grade on a curve or round up grades. If you receive an 89.8, you will receive a B+. One exception to this
rule is that a grade that is very close to the next grade level, such as an 89.9 or 79.9, may be rounded up to
the higher grade if the student has consistently attended class and participated fully in class discussions.
Note the following UT grade standards: an “A” is earned for “excellent” work; “B” for “above average”; C
for “average”; D for “pass”; and F for “failing.”
Grading Breakdown:
● In-class pop quizzes, in-class and take-home individual and group work = 20% total (2 lowest grades
     automatically dropped; absolutely no makeups)
● Exams (2 total) = 60% total (30% each; no makeups)
● Participation & Contribution = 5% total (Based on your active participation and contribution in large
     class and small group-based discussions. Feel free to submit index cards with your interesting,
     provocative, and/or relevant questions/ideas to me at the start or end of class as well.)
● Final Take Home Essay = 15% total (a 5-page cumulative essay that asks you to consider: What, in
     the end, is Japanese film to you? What kinds of claims can you make based on the films we have seen
     and discussed this term?)
Standards and Expectations:
Careful, thorough viewing/reading of the assigned texts by the date indicated on the schedule. Viewing and
     reading require your active engagement with the text. Detailed note taking is essential as is bringing
     your notes and copies of readings to class since you will need to refer to them frequently for group
     and class discussion/activities.
Attendance at all classes and considerate and attentive listening to the lecture. Sleepers and disruptive
     students will be asked to leave.
Active and considerate participation in class and group discussions. Common courtesy is expected. No one
     should monopolize the class discussion or shrink into the background.
Timely completion of assignments. No make-up tests, quizzes, or assignments. Your two lowest grades for
     in-class work and quizzes will be automatically dropped.
Announcements of quizzes and/or homework assignments may be made in the previous class. If you miss
     class, it is your responsibility to find out what has been assigned.
