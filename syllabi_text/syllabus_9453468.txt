Syllabus and Course Policies:
Course Description
As a conclusion to the construction class series, this course’s general goal is to crystallize the accumulated knowledge
and explore further the analysis of how buildings are conceived and detailed, with special emphasis on material selection,
control layers, and improved overall understanding of building enclosures and assemblies.
Learning Outcomes:
•        Learn the importance of architectural detailing as a critical component of the building design process.
•        Understand the fundamentals of heat, air, moisture, and vapor transport through building assemblies.
•        Learn to anticipate constructability challenges with detailing.
•        Understand how codes, standards, and specifications guide the architectural design process.
Prerequisite
Architecture 435L with a grade of at least C and registration for ARC 561C. This course is restricted to students in the
School of Architecture. This course is required of all students pursuing the B Arch, but is not required of all School of
Architecture students.
Required Text
While a traditional text will not be used for the class, articles and other readings will be assigned throughout the course at
the discretion of the instructor.
Required Software
During the second half of the course (starting on March 26th) students will be required to use WUFI Pro 1d hygrothermal
simulation software by Fraunhofer IBP. The software is available on a limited number of computer lab machines or a free
version of the software may be downloaded at this site:
https://wufi.de/en/webshop/
Students are encouraged to apply for a student version of WUFI Pro early in the course.
Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity and
Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259:
Based in the philosophy that all students should be assured equal access and opportunity, Services for Students with
Disabilities works to eliminate physical, instructional and attitudinal barriers by providing reasonable accommodations and
fostering awareness within the University community.
Please notify the instructor of any special needs.
Attendance Policy
Attendance is expected at all lectures. Absences are excused only for medical conditions or personal or family
emergencies. Three absences or more will result in a zero for participation (drop of one letter grade for the term).
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity,
and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust,
fairness, and respect toward peers and community. For more information about academic integrity read:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php.
Religious Holy Days
Notify the instructor of any pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If
you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be
given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.

Course Assignments
Homework assignments and readings are assigned weekly and are typically due the following Tuesday by the beginning
of class. Homework consists of a variety of problem-based questions requiring calculations, sketch exercises, observation
and measurements and may include, but are not limited to using hand-held equipment and sensors, model construction
and mini-case studies. Homework and readings are due at the beginning of lecture, unless otherwise announced.
Homework submitted late will earn reduced credit (-10%). Homework more than one week late will not be accepted and
scored a zero.
