Introduction
From the 1500s to the 1800s, two distinct slave trades flourished in the Americas: one for blacks and
another for Native Americans; both enslaved millions. This course focuses on two chronologically
different types of black slavery. “First Slavery” was a system that connected the Americas to Africa
through the Atlantic slave trade. It thrived in the “colonial” period, when Europeans created many
different empires in New World (but not Africa). First Slavery forcefully removed millions of West
Africans to Europe and to the Americas, from Labrador to Tierra de Fuego. These slaves brought with
them vast array of cultures, religions, plants, animals, and technologies. Under First Slavery, slaves
worked in plantations but they could also become merchants, artisans, sailors, and even slave owners.
Slaves also participated as soldiers in imperial and revolutionary wars, self-purchased, and ran away into
maroon communities. Slaves mixed with Indians, Asians, and whites in rural and urban areas. “Second
Slavery” flourished in the 19th century in the wake of the Age of Revolutions. As millions acquired new
political rights, abolitionism came of age, and empires began to crack down on the Atlantic slave trade,
slavery paradoxically flourished, particularly in the American South, Cuba, and Brazil. Second Slavery
created a new slave trade that reshuffled millions within the American continent, not across the
Atlantic. The new revival of slavery was central to the Industrial Revolution and the growing demand for
raw materials in factories. Second Slavery created new integrated plantations, including the Cotton
Kingdoms in the American South and Texas. Second Slavery reduced slaves to cogs in plantations. It also
generated new, perverse ideologies of scientific racism and white supremacy. First and Second Slaveries
can only be studied within trans-imperial and transatlantic perspective. The readings for this class
emphasize individual biographies and transnational perspectives.
This is a reading and writing intensive seminar. You will receive training on how to identify the
argument of books and chapters within books. You will improve basic writing skills and develop new
ones, particularly on how to organize and justify a research proposal. Every week, we’ll work on
different aspects of the logic and economy of the written word and on the logic of research: overall structure
of essays; the function of paragraphs; the logical structure of sentences; conciseness; how to pose research
questions, offer hypotheses, and marshal evidence to test a hypothesis. You will also learn how to use
citations appropriately to back up your arguments.
Readings
All assigned readings are either available as e-books via the library (see links in syllabus) or as pdfs on
Canvas. There are, however, a couple of titles that you have to buy and they are marked with a (*) in the
syllabus (October 2 and 23))
                                                          1


Assignments (all writing assignment should be carefully edited and proof read)
    a. Ten (10) weekly one page, single space book review (6 points each x 10= 60 points)
        Each review should cover the following points:
              1. Book’s main argument
              2. The crucial empirical evidence deployed by the author to sustain this argument
              3. The structure of the book and how chapters help build the overall argument
    b. One final ten-page research proposal (1500-2000 words) (40 points)
        The proposal should include:
              1.   A question motivating your research and why it is original
              2.   A hypothesis (a plausible answer and how to go about answering)
              3.   A set of primary sources to answer the question
              4.   The strengths and limitations of the sources
              5.   The reasons why to study these source. How they relate to your question and
                   hypothesis
              6. The relationship of your proposal to the work of others
              7. Clear and well written narrative (structure, spelling, syntax, grammar, vocabulary)
Timetable and Grading Criteria for Research Proposal
          First outline (10 points) (due October 9)
          Formal Presentation of Proposal. (5 points) (November 27)
          Final Proposal(1500-2000 words) 25 points. (Nov 27 and December 4)
     First outline (10 points)
               Clear and doable research question (3 points) The question needs to be specific, concrete
               enough to be doable. Overly broad questions will not work. Limit your dates to a few years.
               Limit your question to one problem. You are not working on a problem that would take you
               a lifetime to answer.
               Clarify why it is significant (2 points). You need to articulate clearly why answers to this
               question will yield important, significant insights on the nature of one aspect of the Age of
               Atlantic slavery.
               How the question relates to what other authors have said about this or similar topics (2
               points). You need to provide a bibliography of 2-3 authors who have asked similar or
               related questions but whose research, albeit important, is not complete.and what makes
               your question different than theirs.
               Describe what documents or PRIMARY sources you might be using (why and where they
               are located) (3 points) You need to let me know what documents (in archives or printed) can
               be used to answer your question. Where do you plan to turn to do the research that would
               allow you to provide an answer to the question you asked. What is the nature of the
               documentation needed to answer the question? Where might the document be located?
                                                          2


             These are all preliminary questions at this point, obviously, because you are just beginning
             to dig into these materials.
 The final research proposal (25 points)
     It will be graded around two areas of competence: research skills and ability to
     document facts and assertions through proper footnoting and citation
     1. Research: Students should be able to identify and develop key steps of a research
          project (question, primary sources, management of data collection, analysis, and
          presentation of interpretation).

Plagiarism
         Paraphrasing or copying verbatim a source without attribution is considered plagiarism.
         Students who commit plagiarism (intellectual theft) will be referred to the corresponding
         university authorities and will fail (F) the assignment.
Guns
         A new law, SB 11, allows licensed concealed carriers in most university buildings and classrooms.
         According to the law, concealed guns should remain in holsters “on” or “about” the individual at
         all times. Licensed carriers, therefore, cannot separate themselves from their belongings. Since
         students will be required to give presentations in front of the class and separate themselves of
         their belongings, licensed carriers might be breaking the law if they bring guns in backpacks and
         purses (guns in backpacks also increase the risk of losses and negligent misfire). The law
         prohibits any open display of guns. Anyone in the class should feel free to leave the room and
         call immediately 911 as soon as a gun is spotted. Students who openly display a gun or verbally
         threaten to carry them into classroom will be referred to the competent authorities. The law
         gives me the right not to allow concealed guns into my office. Concealed handguns in my office
         is illegal. The law also gives students the choice of arranging alternative ways of contacting
         instructors (via Skype, for example).
