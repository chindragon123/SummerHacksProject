  Classroom Evacuation for
  Students
  All occupants of university
  buildings are required to evacuate
  a building when a fire alarm and/
  or an official announcement is
  made indicating a potentially
  dangerous situation within the
  building.
  Familiarize yourself with all exit
  doors of each classroom and
  building you may occupy.
  Remember that the nearest exit
  door may not be the one you used
  when entering the building.
  If you require assistance in
  evacuation, inform your
  instructor in writing during the
  first week of class.
  For evacuation in your classroom
  or building:
  1. Follow the instructions of
  faculty and teaching staff.
  2. Exit in an orderly fashion and
  assemble outside.
  3. Do not re-enter a building
  unless given instructions by
  emergency personnel.
