sports, including professional sports, the Olympic Games and college sports.
In professional sports, students will learn about the structure and operation of teams,
leagues and ownership, as well as stadiums and arenas and methods by which they are
financed. We will also discuss revenue sharing and how leagues maintain competitive
balance. Athlete compensation and labor issues will be examined, including unions,

  (“IOC”), national Olympic committees and local organizing committees, including the
  bidding process by which the IOC awards Olympic Games to local organizing commit-
  tees. Revenue generation for the Olympic Games will be covered, including media
  rights exploitation, ticket sales, sponsorship and licensing.
  In college sports, we will discuss the NCAA and its history, conferences and their mem-
  ber institutions, student-athlete compensation, Title IX, litigation and other financial
  challenges facing intercollegiate athletics. Students will learn about business aspects
  of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, football bowl games and the College Foot-
  ball Playoff.
  Lastly, the course will examine various gender equity, racial and ethical issues related
  to sports.
   The course will be primarily lecture and discussion of important issues in sports business with
   guest speakers who are key executives in sports and/or sports media.
   Objectives:          The student who successfully completes this course will ideally be able
                        to:
       1.    Appreciate the history of the sports industry and the impact of this history on the
             current shape of the industry.
       2.    Understand the various revenue sources of sports organizations.
       3.    Analyze the structure and economics of important current and past sports industry
             business transactions.

                                      COURSE OUTLINE
Approach:


This course will be comprised of thirty (30) sessions (two sessions per week), including a mid-
term examination and an examination on the last day of class, with each individual session be-
ing approximately seventy-five (75) minutes in length. There will mixture of lecture by the
principal instructor and guests, group discussion, quizzes and examinations.
Class Preparation:
    1. It is expected that each student will be prepared to participate in informed and con-
         structive discussions.
    2. Reading assignments and homework must be done prior to attending class so that all
         students will benefit from an informed discussion of issues.
    3. Any written assignments are to be typed. Spelling, grammar, and punctuation must
         conform to professional standards. If your presentation or assignments incorporate
         concepts that originated with others, you must acknowledge your utilization of these
         concepts pursuant to MLA citation standards.
    4. All cell phones must be turned off prior to class. Except for the administration of
         weekly quizzes, laptop use is NOT permitted and all laptops must also be turned off
         prior to class.
Attendance:
    Students are expected to attend every class, which is critical to their success in the course
    and the success of the course itself. As noted below, a substantial proportion of each stu-
    dent’s grade will be attributable to in-class activities. Students should be prepared to start
    the class session on time. If for some reason, a student is unable to attend class, that
    student is expected to inform the GA via email prior to class. Being absent or late for
    class may result in a reduction of a student’s grade for the course. If a student misses a
    class for any reason, it is also the responsibility of the student to be informed of the ma-
    terials covered during the class. Each student is encouraged to find a “class buddy” who
    can share information and assignments.
Academic Integrity and Standards:
    Students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity in
    all course activities and assignments. It is expected that there shall be no deception regarding
    the representation made by the student of his/her preparation, participation or performance.
    Plagiarism is presenting another person’s work as though it is one’s own and is a form of
    fraud. Plagiarism includes (but is not limited to) the presentation of a sequence of words
    from another writer, utilized without proper attribution. It is critical that students properly
    acknowledge the work of others and that the acknowledgement be accurate and complete.
    The remainder of the course requirements and policies relating to cheating and plagiarism
    are subject to the standard policies and procedures for all UT-Austin students as established
    by UT-Austin
    .

Use of Canvas in Class
In this class I will periodically use Canvas—a Web-based course management system with
password-protected access at http://courses.utexas.edu —to distribute course materials, to
communicate and collaborate online, to post grades, to distribute assignments, and to give
students online quizzes and/or surveys. You can find support in using Canvas at the ITS

daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related communica-
tions, some of which may be time-critical. You can find UT Austin’s policies and instruc-
tions for updating your e-mail address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/poli-

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at all
educational institutions, including UT Austin, that receive federal funds. UT Austin is
committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all
its forms. Wen sexual misconduct occurs our community, the University can take any or
all of the following actions:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating;
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experience harm or
   have become involved in a Title IX investigation.; and
3. Investigate and discipline violators of the University’s relevant policies.Emergency
   Evacuation Policy
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees”
and/or "Mandatory Reporters”, which means that they are required to report alleged viola-
tions of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and Manda-
tory Reporter and must report any Title IX-related incidents that are disclosed to me. Be-
fore taping with me or with any other faculty or staff member about a Title IX-related inci-
dent, be sure to ask whether he, she or they is a Responsible Employee. If you want to
speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the Uni-
versity, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options
and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@aus-
tin.utexas.edu.
I also take any kind of discrimination or harassment very seriously, and I urge you to re-
port any sexual misbehavior, discrimination, harassment and/or retaliation on the basis of
race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, citizenship, veteran
status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression to the
Office for Inclusion and Equity. Alternatively, you can tell me and I’ll report it.
Emergency Procedures
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and as-
semble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be
aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
     Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember
         that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the build-
         ing.
     If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of
         class.
     In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department,
the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office


Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic
reasons to six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:
        “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education
may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, includ-
ing any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher education, un-
less the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
