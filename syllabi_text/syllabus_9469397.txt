Course Description
This course is designed to introduce students to the various historic and contemporary cultures that
constitute South Asia. Students will learn about South Asia through a variety of disciplinary lenses. A wide-
ranging exploration of the histories, religions, literatures, arts, etc. will acquaint students with the
diversity found in South Asia. This course will expose students to various perspectives that complicate the
question “What is South Asia?”

University Policies
Honor Code: The core values of UT Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through
integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Scholastic Dishonesty and Academic Integrity: Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic
credit will be the student's own work. Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are
subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. “Scholastic dishonesty” includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying
academic records, and any act designed to give unfair academic advantage to the student (such as, but
not limited to, submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor, providing false or misleading information in an effort to receive a
postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment), or the attempt to commit such an
act. For further information please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.
Documented Disability Statement: UT Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for
Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 232-2937 (video phone) or

Religious Observances: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen
days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a
work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Mental Health Resources: Mental health concerns such as anxiety, stress, and depression are very
common among college students. If you are struggling with any of these or other mental health concerns,
you are not alone! I encourage you to seek help and to encourage others who need help to do so. There
is a 24/7 Crisis Line for UT students: 512-471-CALL (2255). Additionally, the UT Counseling and Mental
                                                                                                               2
