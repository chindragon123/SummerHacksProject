Course Objective:
         The objective of this course is to explore how economists describe and measure the economy in
         the aggregate and in specific markets, such as the labor market, the housing market, financial
         markets, and international trade. We will study concepts for measurement and data, as well as
         methods, approaches, and technologies used in social and behavioral science. Students should
         leave the course with an appreciation for the importance of economics in understanding individual
         behavior and social problems.
Resources:
        Two resources are required for the course, both accessible from the same online site. The required
        text for the course is Essentials of Economics, 6th edition by Hubbard and O’Brien. This text is
        contained in digital format on MyEconLab, an online interactive study guide and quiz center, which
        is also required for the course. In addition to a great study resource, MyEconLab will serve as the
        portal for graded online quizzes throughout the semester. The course code for MyEconLab is:
        showalter25388
Instructional Methodology:
         The instructional method will involve mainly lecture and discussion. I may use articles from the
         Wall Street Journal or other business publications to discuss current events, which may be the
         focus for exam or quiz questions.
 Evaluation and Grading Policy:
         Grading is based on three exams and several assignments (homework, in-class work, and
         MyEconLab quizzes) in the following proportion:
                             Assignments                          25%
                             Three exams (equally weighted)       75%
         A letter grade will be assigned to you based on your weighted average course score and your
         performance relative to the rest of the class, with the following scale used as a baseline:
                             A         93.33%
                             A-        90%
                             B+        86.67%
                             B         83.33%
                             B-        80%
                             C+        76.67%
                             C         73.33%
                             C-        70%
                             D+        66.67%
                             D         63.33%
                             D-        60%
                             F         below 60%
         I will drop the lowest assignment score. You cannot make up any homework unless you have a
         university-recognized absence with documentation. The exams will be either multiple-choice or a


        combination of multiple choice and problems/essays. I will post a list of study topics as the exam
        dates draw near.
Attendance and Course Expectations:
        Students are expected to read the material prior to class. Consistent attendance is essential for
        acceptable performance in the course; the economic concepts presented are cumulative in nature,
        and some material presented in class will be an extension of the material in the text, thus one
        cannot simply read the text and expect to do well in the class.
Classroom Civility:
        Students are expected to be attentive and not a disruption to the instructor or fellow classmates.
        Please turn off all cell phone ringers before class begins.
Makeup Exams:
        Makeup exams will only be arranged under my approval. If for some reason you cannot attend an
        exam, please notify me in advance and I’ll determine whether your situation warrants an excused
        absence. If approved, you must arrange to take a makeup exam before the following scheduled
        exam.
Academic Honesty:
        Students are expected to do their own work on quizzes, homework, and exams. Plagiarism and
        other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please refer to official UT policy for more
        information:

Students With Disabilities:
        Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from
        Services for Students with Disabilities: http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/
