COURSE DESCRIPTION:
In this course, we will examine the development of African Queer Studies as the
interdisciplinary study of sexuality on the African continent and its impact on the academic and
activist realm. We will focus on intersectional feminist and queer theory and how it gives us the
tools to rethink issues of oppression and domination in relationship to race, nation, sex, gender,
and sexuality on the African continent. Of particular interest will be LGBT Activism and the
ways in which queer Africans engage and shape their sexuality and create forms of belonging to
their countries and their communities.
Learning Objectives
At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:
1) Identify major themes of African Queer Studies
2) Understand queer theory and its relationship to African lives and LGBT Activism
3) Understand how queer theory informs and is informed by the everyday lives and
experiences of queer Africans

   Course Requirements:
Attendance and Participation: Students are expected to attend class every session.
Participation in all aspects of the class is MANDATORY. All readings and assignments should
be completed before class meetings and students are responsible for adding to class discussions
of material. Please note that attendance and participation is worth 20% of your total grade. Late
arrivals are disruptive to class and I will not repeat concepts and assignments given during class.
If you miss a class or are late, you are still responsible for any announcements, assignments,
lecture material and/or deadlines that are made. Your grade will be affected if you have more
than three absences during the semester.
Active Learning Environment: This is a discussion - based course. While I will do some
lecturing, it is my expectation that students will come to class having completed the readings
and ready to discuss the readings assigned. It is my teaching philosophy that students will learn
as much from each other as they will from me. Discussion based courses allow
students to be active participants in their learning, giving the student the opportunity to place the
reading in the context of his or her lived experience. This does not mean that the student should
ignore the scholarly evidence presented or make arguments solely based on their opinion.
Rather, it allows students to enrich the scholarly environment in relation to their life
experiences. My job as the instructor is to facilitate and guide the discussion, create a safe
participatory environment and make sure that we stay on topic. Merely being


present does not count as active engagement.
Bringing Materials to Class: As part of an active learning environment, students are
required to bring all necessary materials to actively engage in the discussion to class each day.
These necessary materials include but are not limited to the articles/book(s) assigned for the
day. While students are not required to print out hard copies of the pdf. materials for in-class
discussions/assignements, they will be expected to have these materials accessible in
electronic form.
Quizzes: Each week on Friday, beginning in the 4th week of class, unless noted, there will be a
short (15 minute) quiz on the reading assignments for the week. These quizzes are designed to
test whether you have understood the main concepts introduced by the authors. 10 of these
quizzes will count toward the final grade.
Group Presentation: Students will form groups and be responsible for a short (15 minute)
presentation to the class on a current issue related to Queer Studies on the African Continent (i.e
Decriminalization in Mozambique, Queer Literature, LGBT Activism) that deals with the issues
relevant to the class, but has not necessarily been covered in the readings. If students choose an
issue covered in the readings they should be careful to make sure that their presentation adds
new insight or covers new ground not discussed in the readings. Students should consult African
Queer websites, the readings, twitter, tumblr, and instagram for ideas. On Fridays, beginning in
     th
the 6 week of class, the group will present their findings to the class and we will have a short
discussion about the presentation.
Paper Proposal and Final Paper/Project: The final paper will be a research paper (10
pages) that will be designed to assess students accumulated application of knowledge.
Papers must be TYPED, double-spaced, with Times New Roman (or equivalent) 12 point font
and 1 inch margins. NO LATE PAPERS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Please also note that
students must submit a hard copy of the final paper on the final day of class. Students will
develop their final paper/project proposal in consultation with the professor. Prior to the due date
of the final paper students will submit a paper/project proposal to the professor for approval.
Handouts will be given during the semester providing further detail on the assignment. The due
dates of both assignments are noted on the syllabus.
Canvas: I will be in contact with you about updates in assignments through Canvas. It is the
students’ responsibility to make sure that Canvas has your updated email address.
Code of Mutual Respect: In general, this is not a lecture class, but one grounded in dialogue.
Feel free to be candid and direct in this class. Your insights are important, and your voice needs
to be heard, so look forward to the opportunity to chime in. I will respect you
as adults and assume that you will treat others in the class with respect as well. Because we will
be sharing many personal ideas that may conflict with your own personal ideas and beliefs, it is
important that you strive to be considerate, sensitive, and respectful. Be prepared


to offer constructive criticism as well as receive it. We will discuss work that includes lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender themes in this course. Students are expected to approach all class
material with maturity and academic rigor.
Code of Academic Conduct: University policy requires that students cite sources they use in
their work. THIS INCLUDES PARAPHRASING of materials. Any inclusion of ideas that are
not your own will be considered plagiarism. Students who do not properly cite ideas, quotes or
paraphrasing of other published or unpublished material will automatically face disciplinary
action which will also be reflected in their grade. As a reminder, the honor code of the
University is as follows, “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by
the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” For more information on the
Honor Code please see the following link
http://www.utexas.edu/about-ut/mission-core-purpose-honor-code
Students with Disabilities: Any student with a documented disability (physical cognitive)
who requires academic accommodations should contact the Services for Students with
Disabilities area of the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259 (voice) or 471-4641 (TTY
for users who are deaf or hard of hearing) as soon as possible to request an official letter
outlining authorized accommodations.
Religious Holidays: If you observe a recognized religious holiday that is in conflict with
the university schedule, please come talk to me.
Writing Center: I strongly encourage you to use the Undergraduate Writing Center, PCL
2.330, 471-6222: http://www.uwc.utexas.edu/). The UWC offers free, individualized, expert
help with writing for any UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis. These
services are not just for writing that has "problems": Getting feedback from an informed
audience is a normal part of a successful writing project. The UWC’s trained consultants
work with students from every department on both academic and non-academic writing.
Using methods that preserve the integrity of your work, they help you develop strategies to
improve your writing and become a more independent writer. Whether you are writing a lab
report, a resume, a term paper, a statement for an application, or your own poetry, UWC
consultants will be happy to work with you.
