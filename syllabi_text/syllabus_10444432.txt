Course Objectives
Develop professional skills in the development, design, and operation of chemical
processes involving a variety of unit operations (absorption/stripping, distillation,
extraction, adsorption, crystallization, chemical conversions, etc) and a variety of
industrial sectors (petroleum, chemical, power production, microelectronics, biomedical,
environmental, etc).
Provide exposure to process equipment design and operations through class lectures
and individual study during team project execution.
Provide training and experiences in developing their communication skills (reading,
writing, oral presentations, listening) through formal course training, team project
execution, team project presentations, team project reports, and class exercises.
Provide training and experiences in sound problem solving approaches [define the
problem and what is known, what additional information is needed, how do we
obtain/measure the needed information, what techniques can be used to solve the
problem, what is the best approach to obtain a good (timely, adequate accuracy, and
cost effective) solution, and does this solution make sense/what is the best way to verify
it.]
Provide adequate training and experiences in the use of engineering tools such as
computer process simulation and economic models.
Provide learning environment that stimulates students' curiosity and interest in solving
challenging engineering problems.
Provide learning environment that encourages students to "learn on their own" and feel
responsible for their own career development.
Provide learning environment that encourages students to conduct their professional
activities in a fashion consistent with the engineering code of ethics.
