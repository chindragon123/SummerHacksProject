Course Description:
In this course, we examine how various groups of people understood, experienced, and
imagined concepts such as “the East” and “Asia” (including West Asia/the Middle East), with a
primary focus on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. When and where did these concepts
emerge? How did their meanings change over time? What kind of political, economic and
cultural activities did the concepts of “the East” and “Asia” generate among diverse peoples of
“the East” and “Asia”? How did the concept impact these peoples’ collective identities?
Answering these questions requires us to study diverse groups of people, from nineteenth-
century European colonial officials to Malaysian and Singaporean statesmen in the 1980s, from
nineteenth-century Japanese reformers to early twentieth-century Chinese, Indian, Middle
Eastern revolutionaries. Our aim is not to study a comprehensive overview of modern Asian
history. Rather, our aim is to examine the diverse experiences of “Easterners” and “Asians” with
the concepts of the East and Asia. By studying this subject, we aim to think critically about the
geographical and cultural boundaries that we tend to take for granted in twenty-first century
America. More generally, our aim is to learn to think of ourselves as citizens of a larger world by
gaining the ability to comprehend how people remote from ourselves understand, experience,
and imagine their lives.
Goals:
At the end of the course, students will be able to:
    1) discuss key concepts such as civilization, nation, and pan-Asianism
    2) understand the modern history of “Asia” as a connected global experience
    3) discuss the historical contexts in which Asians constructed the idea of “Asia”
    4) view the contemporary world in multiple spatial frameworks
                                                                                                  1


Striving to achieve these goals will require students to seriously engage in such activities as
writing reaction papers and sharing ideas with their peers orally in class discussions. Through
these activities that are based on their readings of both primary sources (various forms of
records from the past produced during the period under study) and secondary sources
(historians’ interpretations of primary sources), students will also improve essential skills to
construct an argument.
Textbooks:
All readings for the course are posted on the course website or available as e-books through UT
library. No need to purchase a particular textbook.

Participation
Participation is different from attendance. You are expected to contribute to class discussions.
Occasionally, I will also ask you to write brief in-class response papers. Although I do not grade
them, I use them to 1) record your attendance; 2) get a sense of your engagement with the
course material.
Reaction Paper
On Week 3, you will submit a short paper about how you think about the concept of
“civilization.” Why it is useful? Why it is problematic? What are alternative methods of thinking
about the connected history of the world? Instead of civilizations, what categories and concepts
do you think we can use? What kind of historical inquiries can elucidate the connected past of
the Afro-Eurasian world?
In-class Midterm Exam
On Week 8, you will have a midterm exam in class. You will be asked to write an essay based on
the readings. In particular, you will be expected to have a solid understanding of the primary
sources we have read in the course.
                                                                                                   2


Short Research Paper
Because of the geographical scope of the course, we will not be able to discuss every important
individual/organization/movement in every country in Asia (including West Asia/the Middle
East). Choose/find a particular individual, organization, movement in Asia or Asian diasporic
communities and write a short research paper about how they express(ed) their ideas of Asia.
I expect that choosing a topic will be a fairly time-consuming part of the process. Start thinking
about your topic early in the semester.
Intellectual Autobiography
Before taking this class, you probably had your own idea of what “Asia” is. You might have
learned it from your parents. You might have internalized what you see/hear in popular culture.
You might have developed particular views through education. In this assignment, think of
yourself as part of the discourse of Asia and explain how your idea of “Asia” had been
constructed prior to taking this class and why it had been constructed that way.
More detailed descriptions of writing assignments are found in a separate document posted on
Canvas.
To Ensure Fairness to All Students:
Classroom behavior:
Cell phones must be on silent mode in class, and texting is strictly prohibited. Also, please limit
the use of your laptop to taking notes unless I ask you to find information on the Internet. If you
fail to follow these basic rules, your participation grade for the course will be adversely
affected.
Attendance:
Attendance is mandatory. More than three unexcused absences will impact your final grade
negatively. If you have an emergency situation (documented illness, serious accidents, funerals)
and cannot make it to class, please let me know before class. Undocumented illness will be
counted as unexcused absences. Doctor’s notes that are more than two-week old are not valid.
If your health impacts your attendance, please inform me of your situation before disappearing.
I cannot retroactively make an exception if you talk to me at the end of the semester.
Late work policy:
Please submit assignments as an MS Word document via email. The deadline is 1:00 p.m. on
the due date (before class starts). Late submissions will be penalized because it is unfair to give
some students extra time to complete the assignment while others submit on time. Each day
after the due date – including weekends – you will lose ten percent of the grade (a letter
grade). For instance, if you make 17 for a 20-point assignment but submit it an hour late, 2 late
                                                                                                    3


points will be deducted. If you submit it 27 hours late, 4 late points will be deducted, so your
grade will be 13. In a nutshell, please be punctual.
Make-up Assignments/Exams:
Make-up assignments for in-class writing activities are permitted in case of emergency
(documented illness and serious accidents) or observance of a religious holy day.
Extensions for longer papers require my advanced approval, which is granted under special
circumstances. If you simply need one more day to complete the assignment, weigh the pros
and cons of losing ten percent of your grade versus submitting a half-baked essay.
Students with Disabilities:
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the
Services for Students with Disabilities. Please bring me a letter at the beginning of the semester
that shows your accommodation. https://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/
Email Policy:
I will be communicating with students via email on a regular basis and will use the email
address you’ve provided to UT Austin in order to do so. It is your responsibility to check that
email account on a regular basis.
                                                                                                 4


                                        Course Schedule
*The schedule below is subject to change. I will make an announcement in class and via email if
I make any changes to the course schedule.
In each meeting, I will give a brief lecture, followed by class discussions. Most assigned readings
are historical studies published in either academic journals or monographs. Many of the
primary sources are in a two-volume collection of pan-Asianists’ writings, Pan-Asianism: A
Documentary History (2011). Each primary source is accompanied by a brief contextualization
of the text written by a historian. Other primary sources are writings by Asian intellectuals that
the secondary sources of the week discuss.
