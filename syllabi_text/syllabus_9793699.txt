                                                Course Description
    This course will provide an overview of theoretical and practical perspectives on the nature of
    language in education, its use and usage. Students will explore principles of discourse, phonology,
    morphology, syntax and semantics as they relate to second language acquisition. We will also cover
    language varieties, social conventions and linguistic structures. The focus of the course is to prepare
    pre-service teachers to best meet the ​linguistic and academic needs of bilingual English learner
    (EL) students in the K-12 classroom.
    Topics include English structures and analysis, identification of bilingual EL students’ academic and
    linguistic learning needs, and pedagogical strategies to promote language acquisition. Our beliefs
    about the English language and its acquisition shape the kinds of opportunities we provide our
    bilingual EL students and are therefore highly consequential to their academic trajectories. This
    course is structured to support the student in designing, implementing and reflecting on the academic
    language development of bilingual EL students in a variety of contexts.
                                                   Course Goals
    By the end of the semester, the successful student will be able to:
    1. Discuss the complexities of the English language.
    2. Explain English language structures and patterns.
    3. Critically analyze the linguistic features of a bilingual EL student’s oral language sample.
    4. Understand language as a sociopolitical and historical construct.
    5. Appreciate varieties of the English language and its ongoing transformation.
    6. Identify the linguistic challenges facing bilingual EL students in the academic context
    7. Design activities appropriate to bilingual EL students’ linguistic needs in the academic context
    8. Identify attitudes towards, and modes of inquiry regarding language
    9. Articulate theories of language (e.g. variation, phonology, social conventions, use/usage)
    10. Identify instructional strategies to address bilinguals’ academic & linguistic development.

Use of e-mail and ​Canvas​ are essential elements of this class. Successful completion of this
course requires that you record a language sample from your bilingual EL student for
transcription and analysis. Projects and assignments must be submitted electronically, posted to
the class ​Canvas​ website. E-mail will be used to communicate with Randy and other class
members. A ​Canvas​ Site has been established for this course; the site contains a copy of this
syllabus, project guidelines, readings which are not in your textbooks, and general course
information. Announcements, updates, and new documents will be posted throughout the course;
students are expected to check ​Canvas​ regularly. Students are encouraged to post their own
presentations to the group presentation folder on ​Canvas​ so others in the class may have access
to them. All students must post to ​Canvas​ their ​critical commentaries​ ​by​ ​9:00am the day
BEFORE the class session readings are due so that Randy can review them before class.
(See below for more details.)
                                             Attendance
Regular attendance and participation is required. One class absence is acceptable; each
subsequent class absence will result in a ​3-point reduction of the final grade​.
    If you absolutely have to miss a class session, talk to me before about your plans for keeping
    up with the coursework and compensating—not eliminating—the absence. You are
    responsible for contacting a class member so that you are prepared for the next class session.
    When you come to class, please sign in on the attendance sheet. Tardies will also lower your
    final grade for this class.
    Religious Holy Days​: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at
    least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a
    class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy
    day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time
    after the absence.
    If you must be absent on a day when you are ​scheduled to present,​ it is imperative that you
    let Randy know prior to class so that adjustments may be made. ​A letter-grade reduction
    will be given if notification is not received prior to 8:00am on the appointed date.
Class sessions will include short lectures, small and whole group discussions, virtual responses,
and student presentations. In order to accomplish the goals of the course, classes are designed for
active participation online and in-class​. Students are expected to come to class prepared to
discuss the assigned material. Your perspectives are appreciated, needed, and respected, and
should be shared. Students will respect the viewpoint of all class members. Students’ grade will
depend in part on ideas and understandings developed in class.

ALD 329 carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience
writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you will write regularly throughout the semester,
complete a substantial writing project, receive feedback from your instructor and your peers to
help you improve your writing, and provide like feedback to your peers. You will also have the
opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your
peers’ work. A substantial portion of your grade will come from your written work. Writing Flag
classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication,
Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education

                                      Linguistic Analysis (30%)
Students will display their understanding of both (1) the distinct structure and features of oral
English, and (2) the linguistic development of bilingual EL students by analyzing a language
sample from a tutoring session with their student. Language samples will include approximately
10 minutes of discussion around an academic or social topic. Claims made in the linguistic
analyses must be supported by ​references​ drawn from course readings as well as external texts.
Final projects will consist of 4 discrete sections:
Introduction
How do you connect with your student? What have you learned about yourself and your student
beyond our course teachings? What kind of EL/bilingual instruction does your student
experience? How has this experience influenced your perspective on language and culture in the
community? Connect to course readings as possible. (1.5-2 p.) ​(cont.)

                     i. Describe 2-3 recommended instructional strategies for working with your
                        bilingual EL student.

SOLOM Results and Discussion.
Throughout your classroom observations and tutoring sessions, take the time to chat in English.
Analyze the how and why of your participant’s SOLOM results. How (well) does the SOLOM
measure a learner’s use of: syntax, semantics, morphology, phonology, language use/usage?
Which features of the EL student’s oral language prompted the rater to place him/her at each
level in each domain? How well do ratings in the individual language ability areas reflect the
overall assessment? What questions did the SOLOM answer for you as a teacher? Were any
areas of concern left unaddressed? (1-2 pages; min. 2 references)

        In the 2​nd​ or 3​rd​ week of your tutoring experience, you will record a ​language sample
        with your bilingual student.
        You will not be interviewing your student, rather you will be recording a regular tutoring
        session. You will then transcribe this language sample, both your language and your
        student’s, and use this as the base of your linguistic analysis. (cont.)
Print out a copy of your ​transcript​ and bring this to class with you. You will use the language
elicited from the L2 learner to identify various linguistic features we examine in class. In class,
we will workshop our transcripts, looking for examples of:
                Pragmatic competence
                Semantic development
                Phonological development
                Morphological development
                Syntactic development (cont.)
        As you work with your EL student throughout the semester, reflect on his/her language
        growth and development. At the end of the semester, you will evaluate your student’s
        English proficiency based on the SOLOM rubric. The ​SOLOM​ allows a teacher to
        observe an EL student’s oral English skills in a natural context and identify the
        appropriate English language development stage through observation.
