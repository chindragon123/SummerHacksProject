Course Description
This course examines theatre, dance and performance art by and about Asian Americans. We analyze
these media in social, political, and historical contexts. We also use these sources as models for creating
our own original work. As such, this class is focused on praxis—the marriage of theory and practice. In
other words, this course combines analysis of writing and media with learning basic methods for
collaboration and devising performance. We define Asian America broadly, including both immigrants
and people of Asian descent who have lived in the Americas for multiple generations. We engage with
both documented (via text, video, or description) and live performance to examine how performance as
a medium and mode of making meaning affects our perception of the world. We employ strategies from
gender studies, queer studies, performance studies, and critical race studies to discuss how Asian
Americans make meaning through performance, and how performance represents Asian America.
Finally, we use our critical analysis to discover and apply creative strategies toward building meaning
around Asian America that reflects our own political and social beliefs and hopes.
Course Objectives
After successfully completing this course, students will be able to:
    1. Describe, analyze and interpret works of Asian American performance, including but not limited
        to theatre, dance, and performance art
    2. Discuss cultural artifacts and meaning around Asian American issues, using terms relating to
        theatre/dance/performance art, engaging critical and aesthetic issues that cross both fields
    3. Create cultural artifacts relating to lived experience of Asian Americans
    4. Articulate the vital importance of creative rigor and voice toward forging new meanings and
        engaging politically and socially in our world

    Critical Analysis Paper and Revision (5 pgs): The prompt for this assignment is in Canvas under
    “Assignments.” This paper will require you to find at least two sources outside course materials to
    support your argument. The quality of your writing—including clarity of ideas, strength of
    argument, syntax and grammar—is integral to your grade. After you submit this paper, I will provide
    you feedback for a grade and you will workshop your paper with a peer. Taking this feedback into
    consideration, you will revise and re-submit the paper along with the original submission. Your
    grade for the project will be based on the overall quality of the written project as well as your ability
    to receive feedback and integrate it into your final version. The feedback you provide to your peer
    will also be taken into consideration. The goal of this exercise is not only to develop your writing
    skills, but also your revising and editing skills. I strongly recommend using the Undergraduate
    Writing Center.
    Performance Response (2 pgs each for 5 Performances): You are required to attend Department
    of Theatre and Dance productions as well as other performances related to the content of this course,
    including Locus of Control. You are responsible for being able to discuss them in class. In addition,
    you must write a scholarly, formal response to one performance. Response papers should include a
    synopsis of the event as well as use of at least one cited course reading. Follow the general arch of
    describe, analyze, interpret to guide your writing structure. These papers are due at the beginning of
    the class in which we discuss the productions.
    Creative Practical Project (5-8 pages): In order to better understand Asian American theatre and
    dance, you must understand some aspect of producing work. Relating the content or structure to the
    Asian American experience, you must either create an original performance-based piece, or a
    structural plan to foster Asian American theatre, dance, or performance art. You may use this
    assignment to expand on training you already have, you may also use it as an incentive to begin
    acquiring skills, or you may submit a plan for a creative performance project. This includes, but is
    not limited to: a short original script or script excerpt; a choreographed dance; a piece of
    performance/installation art; a mock grant proposal for a commissioned play or dance; a mission and
    business plan for a troupe or company. For performances, you must document your performance
    with video and submit the video in tandem with your written work.
          All written materials should include the following: brief description of how the piece relates to
          course content, any models or influences (previous artists) you might have looked at to help you,
          a description of your process. Because you are relating to critical race studies, your written work
          should include citations.
          If you are writing a script: Your script needs to be at least 5 pages, but can be more. You will
          need to include 3-5 page description separate from the script outlining the above elements.
Updated: January 23, 2019                                                                              2


          If you are creating a movement piece or physical theatre: Your written portion will need to
          cover the above elements and should be between 3-5 pages. It will be separate from the
          movement piece and you should upload a video of the full piece either to Canvas or include a
          link (to youtube or vimeo, etc.) in your paper.
    Final Project Proposal (1-2 pg): You have two options for your final project. Option 1.) Conduct a
    standard research paper using primary and secondary sources that relate performance and Asian
    America. If you choose to write a research paper, your proposal should include an outline of your
    research question, a hypothesis, and possible primary and secondary literature you plan to use.
    Option 2.) Devise, create and execute a creative project that relates to Asian American history,
    experience, or cultural production. This can be in the form of a performance (dance, devised theatre,
    etc.) or an original short play. Option 2 may be done solo, in duos or a group. Outline what you plan
    to make and your planned process for doing so. You must also include your aesthetic and theoretical
    influences, your creative process, as well as a rationale for choosing your medium and subject
    matter.
    Final Project presentation: You will each have seven minutes, including question and answer
    sessions to present your work and solicit feedback. If you choose to collaborate on a creative project,
    you may combine your allotted presentation time.
    Final Project/Paper and Revision: The final project is a culmination of all your work in this class.
    As such, I expect it to be clear, eloquent, and well argued. If you choose to write a research paper,
    you will be graded on the use and knowledge of theory and literature, the quality of your writing, the
    tightness of your argument, and the overall structure of the paper. Research papers should be 12-15
    pages. If you choose to make a creative project, you must also submit a 10-12-page report outlining
    your process, influences, and theoretical analysis. You will be graded on the rigor of your creative
    process, your craft, and relevance to course material as well as the quality of your written report. As
    with the Critical Analysis Paper, you will peer-review each other’s writing.
    How to Read Breakdowns (1 pg, each): The very first reading I assign you is a short manual on
    “How to Read” scholarly articles quickly. This article outlines how to distill a scholarly writing.
    Later in the semester, we will read guidelines on how to read plays and watch dance. Using these as
    guides, you will create “breakdowns” of each required reading in class.
    Class Participation: In a small class such as this, you will only learn what you contribute. To do
    well in this class, you must both speak and listen. Students who rarely speak will receive low
    participation credit. Students who talk a lot but clearly have not thought about the materials will also
    receive low credit. You are expected to attend all classes on-time and prepared in order to participate
    in discussion and in-class exercises. This means you read and watch all required text and arrive to
    class with questions and thoughtful comments on them. Unexcused absence, late arrival and early
    departure from class will be penalized. Four unexcused absences will result in an “F” for the entire
    class. Tardy arrival and early departure will be counted as half an unexcused absence.
    Grading Criteria: Rubrics will be posted for each assignment in Canvas. You will receive high
    grades in this class if you are diligent in your reading and writing, you show a clear understanding of
    the materials, and you work to foster a rigorous and stimulating intellectual environment. For
    critical/analytical exercises, this means that you integrate course readings into your writings, you
    devise and support a strong and thoughtful argument, and you submit work that is free from
    grammatical and syntactical errors. For creative exercises, this means that you show knowledge of

    concepts, integration of creative and theoretical ideas, extensive process work, attention to craft, and
    an overall rigorous and diligent attitude. Documentation as well as presentation of your creative
    project is integral to your grade. Based on these criteria: A=excellent, B=good, C=average, D=below
    average, F=failing. If you feel that your grades do not match the effort you are exerting, please see
    me during my office hours.
Class Expectations/Ground Rules
    Discussions: Because of the nature of critical race, performance, and queer studies, this class will at
    times make you feel uncomfortable. You may find other classmates or even myself saying things
    that may offend or shock you. Listen well. Discuss topics rigorously using the course materials to
    support your arguments. Personal narratives can be helpful but be mindful of when you are using
    personal experience as evidence for an argument or for personal reasons. Respect each other as
    fellow scholars and me as your facilitator and designated expert. Become experts in your own right
    and challenge one another to think deeply. Please avoid dominating conversation, name-calling, and
    silencing others.
    For Creators: If you plan to use this class as a place to explore your creativity, I suggest that you
    keep a sketchbook or journal of ideas you have relating to race/Asian Americans and artistic
    production. If you would like to submit an electronic copy of your sketchbook at the end of class,
    you can receive extra credit.
    Physical Demands
    You are responsible for your body. Because we will be examining performance, some class sessions
    may be physically demanding and rigorous. Please alert me to any injuries or physical limitations
    you might have that could require modifications. Although I expect you to push yourself, I do not
    expect you to endure pain or experience injury. If you are sick and contagious, DO NOT come to
    class. I may ask you for documentation of your illness.
    Use of Electronics: Please turn off your cell phones while in class. I strongly recommend using pen
    and notebook to take notes. Studies have shown that typing notes does little for committing
    information to memory while hand-written notes help you to remember. I encourage you to incline
    yourself toward remembering. Use your laptop judiciously. Please be courteous. Surfing the web or
    social networking during discussions will result in me asking you to leave class.
    Late Policy: If you turn an assignment in late, I will dock one-third of a letter grade for every day it
    is late (B turns into B-, etc.). I will not accept papers more than five days late. Please note that I will
    not accept late final projects.
Incompletes
Students are not permitted to take an Incomplete for this course, except in the case of a documented
health or family emergency discussed in advance with me. If you feel you are falling behind in your
work, it is your responsibility to meet with me and formulate a plan of action well in advance of the end
of the semester so that you can complete the course successfully.
Services for Students with Disabilities
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. Students with physical or learning disabilities should provide the
professor with a letter requesting reasonable academic accommodation, and work directly with the
professor to determine what accommodations are needed. This letter can be obtained from Services for

Students with Disabilities, located in the Student Services Building. For more information, contact the
Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY, or visit their website at:

The University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold these
values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Scholastic Dishonesty
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process.
Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading information to
receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of
essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor.
By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic
dishonesty damages both the student’s learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a
work-career. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. For
more information on scholastic dishonesty, please visit the Student Judicial services website at
deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs.
Religious Holidays
Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If you miss a work
assignment or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day you will be given an
opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. It is the policy of
the University of Texas at Austin that you must notify your instructor at least fourteen days prior to the
classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a religious holy day.
Course Content
At times this semester we will be discussing and/or viewing material that may be upsetting to some
students. Important, but sometimes difficult and contentious, topics related to race, ethnicity, gender,
sexuality, etc., are to be expected in an Asian American Studies course. If you ever feel the need to step
outside during a discussion or screening, you may do so without academic penalty. You will, however,
be responsible for any material you miss. Please note that the class will be committed to respectful
dialogue at all times.
Resources and Assistance
Assistance with writing is available at the Undergraduate Writing Center on a drop-in basis or by
appointment (FAC 211; 471-6222). Help with studying and writing skills can be found at the UT
Learning Center (Jester Center A332; 471-3614).
A Note About Firearms
Some exercises in this class will be physical in nature and not safe for participants with concealed
firearms or for their peers. I therefore ask that you leave firearms at home for our class. Also, while my
office is shared, I respectfully ask you do not bring firearms into office hours.
This syllabus is subject to change.
