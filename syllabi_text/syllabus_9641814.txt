Content:
This course is an introduction to the study of drugs and behavior. We will first cover the basic foundations of
the nervous system, such as anatomy and physiology. Then, we will study the mechanisms of drug addiction
and major substances of abuse. Finally, we will discuss various drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric and
neurodegenerative disorders.
Textbook:
Psychopharmacology: Drugs, the Brain, and Behavior by JS Meyer and LF Quenzer, 2nd edition (optional)
Grading Policy: The course grade will be based on four examinations, each covering about one-fourth of the
course material. Each exam will be worth 100 points. The exams will be a mixed format of multiple-choice
questions and short-answer questions. There are no make-up tests unless you have a written doctor’s note.
After grading, the exams will be handed back to you in the class for a review but will be collected after the
review. If you would like to examine your exams further, you can do so during the instructor’s (not the TA’s)
office hours. Any grading disputes or corrections must be brought to the instructor’s (not the TA’s) attention
within three days after the exam has been reviewed in the class regardless whether you were present during the
review or not. Afterwards, no grade adjustments to the exam will be made.
Letter grade cutoffs are as follows (in percentage):
       93-100 = A             87-89.9 = B+            77-79.9 = C+          67-69.9 = D+            < 60 = F
       90-92.9 = A-           83-86.9 = B             73-76.9 = C           63-66.9 = D
                              80-82.9 = B-            70-72.9 = C-          60-62.9 = D-

Academic Integrity
Cheating or plagiarizing on assignments does not allow for an accurate assessment of your progress and
undermines the assessment of other students’ progress. Therefore, cheating or plagiarism will not be tolerated.
Cases of academic dishonesty will be handled on a case by case basis. For more information about policies
regarding academic integrity, please refer to the Office of the Dean of Students at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php.
Additional information:
    A. Canvas will be used to distribute course materials, to communicate, and to post grades. In particular, the
        lecture material will be posted ~24 hours prior to each lecture. It is expected that you bring it to the
        class to take notes.
    B. Use of E-mail is the University’s official correspondence. Thus, you are encouraged to check your e-
        mail on a regular basis.
    C. Attendance will not be taken and factored into grading, but you are responsible for the
        materials/information discussed in the class.
    D. Use of a laptop/tablet is permitted as long as it is not disruptive to the class. However, the instructor
        holds the right to regulate the use of laptops and other electronic devices at anytime during the lecture.
    E. Course participants with a license to carry a handgun must keep it concealed and on them at all times. If
        a gun becomes visible, the person who sees the gun should leave the classroom and call 911 so that law
        enforcement personnel can take appropriate action and restore an atmosphere conducive to learning.
