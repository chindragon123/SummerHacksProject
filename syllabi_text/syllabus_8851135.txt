Course Objectives
 Gain an understanding of the theory and “language” of taxation.
 Establish a broad understanding of the tax policy framework from which we can make informed decisions as
     voters. Identify tax policy issues suggested by or underlying particular provisions of the tax law.
 Show how taxation affects the economic decisions of multiple parties to a transaction. Build an appreciation
     for the importance of tax considerations in financial transactions.
 Teach sufficient detail about tax laws to provide a basic knowledge for all the students who are future
     taxpayers and the subset of students who become tax advisors. Apply basic tax rules and regulations to
     compute the taxable income and federal income tax liability for individual and corporate taxpayers.
Required Materials
Principles of Taxation for Business and Investment Planning by Jones, Rhoades-Catanach, and Callaghan. I will
be using the 2019 version. While I typically don’t mind students using older version of the textbook, the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act was a major change to many aspects of the tax law so prior materials will be inaccurate. The
recommended practice problems correspond with the 2019 version of the book. You do not have to buy access to
McGraw Hill’s Connect software, but I will make some problems available on Connect. It was less expensive to
get the textbook if it came along with access to Connect.
Chapter 17 (Accounting for Income Taxes) of Taxation of Individuals and Business Entities by Spilker et al. This
individual chapter can be purchased from McGraw Hill as an ebook for $7.31. To purchase this ebook, go to
http://create.mheducation.com/shop/ then enter ISBN: 9781307293647.
Course Requirements and Grading
Your grade in the course will be determined as follows:
          Exam 1 in class                                                            100
          Exam 2 in class                                                            100
          Final Exam                                                                 200
          Tax return projects (2 projects/quizzes—15 pts and 25 pts)                  40
          Group project and presentation                                              50
          Electronic assignments/quizzes (best 12 out of 16 x 5 pts each)             60
                   Total                                                             550
          Note: there may also be an opportunity to help Prof. Williams with some of his research and get extra
          credit for doing so.


Williams                                      Introduction to Taxation, Fall 2018                            page 2
Grades will be based on mastery of the material. I have adopted plus/minus grading as the standard for all sections
of the course. I expect to award a few B-‘s and C’s, many B’s, and some B+/A-/A’s with an overall course GPA
around 3.3. I reserve the right to curve grades upward if needed.
Exams:
The exams will be a combination of multiple choice/matching questions (which may be theoretic or numeric),
short essay questions, and workout problems. The comprehensive final exam will be all multiple choice and
matching.
One 4 inch x 6 inch notecard full of notes (two-sided front and back) will be allowed for each midterm exam. Use
of the card is optional and not required. I will ask you to hand in your notecard with your exam. I will provide
any present value, MACRS, or tax rate information needed to solve the problems on the exam. You will not be
allowed to use your book or any other notes during exams. For the final exam, you will be able to use one
standard 8.5”x11” sheet of paper (two-sided front and bank).
Regrade requests for the midterm exams must be submitted to me in writing within 3 business days after exams
are returned in class.
Tax return projects:
The syllabus also lists two tax return projects. For each project, there will be a five point electronic quiz on
Canvas. The remainder of the grade will be based on submission of the correct and completed tax forms. You
may not use tax return software to complete these projects. The purpose of these projects is to give you
opportunities to (1) get comfortable finding your way around the IRS website, (2) read tax form instructions, and
(3) see how various forms work and flow together.
Group project and presentation:
One class session near the end of the semester will be dedicated to group project presentations. I will assign you
into groups of approximately four people. For the project, your group will take on the role of a lobbying firm that
is trying to persuade a lawmaker how to vote on a particular policy issue. Each group will be assigned to an issue
and must prepare to lobby both for and against the policy. We will randomly select groups beforehand to see
which group will lobby for and which group will lobby against the policy. Groups will have five minutes to
present and five minutes to answer questions.
Each group will be required to submit a four page written document that presents and supports the most
compelling arguments for and against the proposed policy. Each group will also submit a short power point
presentation (3 slides or less) that can be used in their presentation.
 More details to follow later in the semester.
Quizzes:
An assignment is due for nearly every class—either an exam, an electronic quiz or a project. Electronic quizzes
will be posted on Canvas. The main objective of the quizzes is to make sure you are reading the material before
class. Of the 16 quizzes on the assigned chapters, I will count the best 12. All quizzes must be completed by 8:00
am on the date they are assigned. You should read chapter material and consider recommended exercises prior to
attempting the quizzes, because the quizzes have time limits.

Homework:
Finally, the attached schedule recommends end-of-chapter questions for class discussion and preparation for
quizzes and exams, but I will not collect these. Solutions will be posted on Canvas, but you should invest effort in
working them independently – I will adapt some exam questions from the assigned homework, so your effort will
be rewarded.
By UT-Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in
order to observe a religious holiday, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time after the absence.
Description of Requirements
Class Participation
Group sharing and problem-solving activity will be an integral component of your in-class experience. You
contribute to the class learning environment in the following ways:
 helping classmates solve recommended out-of-class problems,
 expressing your opinion in class discussions and volunteering answers to problems worked in class,
 posting questions, solutions, or current events links and summaries to the class web site,
 asking questions during class or posting questions to the class web site. I (and the rest of the class) appreciate
      the student who says “slow down, I’m confused.”
Class Web Site and Student Privacy
Password-protected class sites will be available for all accredited courses taught at The University. Syllabi,
handouts, assignments and other resources are types of information that may be available within these sites. Site
activities could include exchanging email, engaging in class discussions and chats, and exchanging files. In
addition, class email rosters will be a component of the sites. Students who do not want their names included in
these electronic class rosters must restrict their directory information in the Office of the Registrar, Main
Building, Room 1. For information on restricting directory information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi02-03/app/appc09/html.
Students with Disabilities
Upon request, the University of Texas at Austin provides appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the
Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259,
http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/. Please notify me of any such needs within two weeks of the first
exam.
McCombs Classroom Professionalism Policy
The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs community. Faculty are
expected to be professional and prepared to deliver value for each and every class session. Students are expected
to be professional in all respects.
The Texas MPA classroom experience is enhanced when:

Academic Dishonesty
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both
students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the BBA Program’s Statement
on Scholastic Dishonesty at http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics.aspx. By teaching this course,
I have agreed to observe all faculty responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this class, you
have agreed to observe all student responsibilities described in that document. If the application of the Statement
on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me
for clarification. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty
harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to the Student Judicial Services website at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ to access the official University policies and procedures on scholastic
dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
I owe it to you to set rules that I can enforce, so that you don’t worry that you are honest but that other classmates
gain an advantage from dishonesty.
Exams: Each student must complete the exams independently during the designated exam period. Do not refer to
other students’ exam solutions or discuss the exam with other students during the exam period. Do not send text
messages or access prohibited materials during the exam. Students who have taken an exam are prohibited from
discussing the exam with students who have not yet taken the exam.
Electronic assignments/quizzes and tax return projects: On outside assignments, including electronic quizzes, you
may obtain outside help and work with others, including classmates, former students, finding copies of solutions,
etc. Because I permit collaboration, I do not make outside work a large component of the grade.
Campus Safety
 Please note the following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety
and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/:
       Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
         when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
       Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that
         the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
       Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform their instructor in writing during the first week
         of class.
       In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
       Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The
         University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
       Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050 (or
