V. Course Requirements

       • Because of the cumulative nature of language learning, it is essential that students keep up with course
           work on a daily basis and attend all classes.
       • Absence will not excuse a student in any way from responsibility for course material.
       • It is the policy of UT Austin that the student must notify the instructor at least 14 days prior to the
           classes scheduled on dates s/he will be absent to observe a religious holy day.
       • Your active participation in class activities will greatly enhance your progress in Japanese. Please do
           not be afraid of making mistakes/errors in the classroom.

                that make you re-enter the classroom.
2) Homework -- No late / incomplete homework will count toward your grade.
       • You will be given written and JOSHU online homework assignments almost every day. Do your
           homework promptly and carefully. In order to earn credit, answer all of the questions even though
           you are not sure of the correct answer.
       • Homework is due at the beginning of the first class of each day, so turn it in before the class starts.
       • Electronic submissions are not accepted except for JOSHU on-line homework.
       • Late, incomplete, or sloppily done homework may be accepted but will not be counted for credit.
       • Write neatly. Use only pencil (and erase carefully).
       • Write your name on each homework sheet. If there are more than 2 pages, staple them in the upper
           left corner. Your instructor is not responsible for missing pages when pages are not having names
           or stapled together.
       • Early homework is accepted for credit. If you need to turn in your homework early (e.g., one day
          early), you must provide the written note (stating which homework of what date you are turning in
          early) attached to your homework, so that the instructor can understand your situation. Without the
          written note, we will not accept and grade the homework turned in early.
       * Workbook homework – Tear out assigned pages indicated in the schedule, complete them, and turn
           them in. You can do your homework, using photocopied pages (Workbook is on reserve at PCL).
           Homework answers written on a piece of paper will not be accepted.
       * Hiragana/katakana homework – Use practice sheets available in Canvas Modules (Homework).

          link for each assignment are provided in Canvas Modules (JOSHU Homework).
       * Composition homework assignments (10 pts. for each composition) - You will write two
          compositions, using genkooyooshi in Canvas. See Canvas Modules (Handouts) for information.

                § Follow the instructions in “How to Use Genkooyooshi.”
                § A late, short, or sloppily done composition will result in grade deduction.
                § In each composition, you should try to use new vocabulary and grammar patterns that have
                    been introduced in class. In addition, you are expected to use kanji introduced in class.
                § You cannot use vocabulary, grammar pattern, or kanji that have not been introduced in class.
                § Write neatly. Use pencil and erase carefully.
                § Using translation programs or having others assist you is considered as cheating.
                    Write and revise your composition on your own.


                 §  Feedback sheet (CanvasàModulesàHandouts) contains the composition topic, guidelines,
                     and so on.
                 §  Staple the feedback sheet to your draft. Failure to attach the sheet will result in points
                     deducted from your grade.
                 §  You will receive feedback on your draft, and then you are expected to turn in a corrected
                     version based on the suggested feedback.
                 §  Staple the draft with the feedback sheet to the corrected version:
                     draft + the feedback sheet attached to the draft + rewrite (3 pages). Failure to attach the
                     draft and/or the feedback sheet will result in points deducted from your grade.
                 §  Without writing a draft, you won't receive any credit even if you turn in a ‘final version’ on
                     the due date.
                 §  The instructor will use the following marks when giving feedback on your compositions:
                         H: hiragana     Kt: katakana Kj: kanji             Sp: spelling           V: vocabulary

                         ?: unclear      ^: insertion    strike: deletion à: Change to            Cj: conjugation
        ＊＊＊You must do your homework on your own. Unauthorized collaboration on homework and/or
        copying someone's homework and turning it in as your own will be considered as cheating and will
        result in a severe penalty. Allowing other students to use your homework is also considered as	 
        scholastic dishonesty. Please read the UT’s policies on students’ scholastic dishonesty.

VI. Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
      The University Honor Code:
          “The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
          leadership, individual opportunity and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected
          to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness and respect toward peers and
          community.”
        • Students who violate university rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
           including the possibility of failing the course and dismissal from the University. For further
           information, please visit the website: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
    The following are some examples of behaviors regarded as scholastic dishonesty.
          *   Copying homework/quiz/tests/exam answers.
          *   Showing your homework/exam answers to other students.
          *   Copying other peoples' work or phrases without citing.
          *   Having someone else write or correct a paper/composition for you.
          *   Seeking and Receiving help from others such as a native speaker of Japanese for doing homework
              or writing a composition/skit.
          * Distributing course materials online or elsewhere. This violates the rights of the copyright
              holder.


VII. Students Accommodations
       Any student with a documented disability (physical or cognitive) who requires academic
       accommodations should contact the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of the
       Dean of Students at 471-6259 as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized
       accommodations.
VIII. Studying Japanese
       • In learning a foreign language, it is important to study every day.
       • Actively participate in class. Use Japanese whenever possible, and do not be afraid of making
         mistakes.
       • Spend as much time as possible, studying with online audio files.
                       http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072408154/student_view0/index.html
       • Develop a systematic way of organizing an increasingly large amount of material for which you
         will be responsible. Language learning requires constant review of previously-learned material.
       • You may want to make vocabulary cards or lists according to word groups.
       • Find your own leaning and organizational style, and continue reviewing on a daily basis.
       • Read the “Study Hints” in the textbook pages 3, 13, 51, 83, 115-6, 122-3, and 134-5 for suggestions.
       • Join Japanese related clubs at UT, such as Japanese Conversation Table (@Union) and Japanese
         Association (UT student organization).
