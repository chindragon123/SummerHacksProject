Instructor:                  Larry Speck
Time:                        TTh 12:30-2:00pm
Place:                       BUR 106

Prerequisites
None. This course may be used to fulfill the visual and performing arts component of the
university core curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by the
Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking skills,
teamwork and social responsibility. This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global
Cultures courses are designed to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United
States. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from
assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of non-U.S. cultural groups, past and
present.
Educational Objectives
       1. To establish a perspective of the role and influence of architecture in society
            and vis-a-vis other disciplines in the arts and science.
       2. To develop an understanding of how architecture is shaped by and reflects
            cultural values and social organization.
       3. To present a broad picture of issues and factors which influence architectural
            design.
       4. To understand how global cultures create environments that both reflect and
            shape their values.
Educational Approach
This is a reading/looking/listening/thinking course. It will follow a lecture format supplemented
by related outside reading and required participation in discussion sections that hone skills in
critical thinking, communication and teamwork. Students will also give oral presentations on
their research in discussion sections.
Evaluation
There will be three tests as well as a final exam in the course. Each test will count 15% of your
final grade. The final will also count 15%. Participation in class (in the form of question
responses due most class periods) and in discussion sections will count 20%. The remaining 20%
of your grade will be based on a series of short analytical exercises that you will do through the
semester. Tests will include multiple choice questions as well as short answer questions
analyzing buildings on campus or nearby to demonstrate understanding of material covered in
lectures and readings over a five- to seven-week period. The final exam will deal with
comprehensive material covered in the course. Analytical exercises will be dealt with primarily
in discussion sections. Students with disabilities may request accommodations. See

                                    Policies and Information
Make-up exams will only be given to students with satisfactory justification for excused absences.
Excused absences can be justified in one of three ways:
  1. Absence due to illness–Student Health Center can document even minor illness quickly
     and easily. A note from them is satisfactory for absence due to illness.
  2. Absence due to family emergency which requires travel out of town–A note from a
     parent or other responsible family member can document such required absence.
  3. Absence due to student observance of a religious holiday. Arrangements must be made
     in advance with instructor or TA.
ALL REQUESTS FOR MAKE-UP EXAMS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING WITHIN ONE
WEEK OF THE MISSED EXAM ALONG WITH PROPER DOCUMENTATION.
