                                             Course Description
This course will provide an overview of theoretical and practical perspectives on the nature of language
and language use in education. Students will explore principles of discourse, phonology, morphology,
syntax, and semantics as they relate to second language acquisition. Topics associated with language
varieties, social conventions, and linguistic structures will also be explored. The focus of the course is to
prepare prospective teachers/professionals to best serve the linguistic and academic needs of
bi(multi)lingual English learners (ELs) in the K-12 classroom.
This course is structured to support the student in designing, implementing and reflecting upon the
academic language development of ELs through linguistic analysis. Identification and articulation of ELs
strengths as well as their instructional needs will assist students in the planning of instructional
approaches and strategies that facilitate the acquisition of language and literacies. Beliefs and
misconceptions related to language acquisition (English), language variety, and language use will be
examined to better understand the impact on ELs learning opportunities and academic trajectories.
                                                 Course Goals
By the end of the semester, the successful student will be able to:
1. Discuss the complexities of the English language.
2. Explain English language structures and patterns.
3. Critically analyze the linguistic features of a bi(multi)lingual EL’s oral language sample.
4. Understand language as a sociopolitical and historical construct.
5. Appreciate varieties of the English language and its ongoing transformation.
6. Identify the linguistic challenges facing bilingual ELs in the academic context
7. Design activities appropriate for bi(multi)lingual ELs’ linguistic needs in the academic context
8. Identify attitudes towards language and the impact on modes of inquiry
9. Articulate theories of language (e.g. variation, phonology, social conventions, use)
10. Identify instructional strategies addressing bi(multi)lingual ELs’ academic & linguistic development.

Attendance:
Regular attendance and participation is required. One class absence is acceptable; each
subsequent class absence will result in a 3-point reduction of the final grade. If you absolutely
have to miss a class session, a meeting with the instructor is necessary prior to the absence to
discuss your plans for keeping up with the coursework and compensating—not eliminating—the
absence. It will be your responsibility to get the class notes and be prepared for the next class
session. Please sign the attendance sheet upon arriving to class, if tardy, your final grade will be
reduced by 1.5 pts for each tardy. If you must be absent on the day scheduled for a group
presentation, it is imperative that you notify me in advance as it affects the group. A letter-grade
reduction will be given if notification is not received prior to 12:00 noon on the day prior to
the group presentation date.
Religious Holy Days: Per UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at
least fourteen days prior to the date of a religious holy day observance. If you must miss a class,
an examination, an assignment, or a project to observe a religious holy day, you will have the
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Laptops and Cell Phones:
Laptops must only be used in appropriate ways and at appropriate times as a common courtesy to
our scholarly community. Please refrain from surfing the internet, checking email, shopping,
doing research, texting, or completing assignments for other classes during class. If you
anticipate an urgent message on cell/smart phone, please inform the instructor prior to class.
Failure to comply with policy will result in receiving a reminder of the expectations through
email and a minimum 2-point reduction in the class participation grade for the day.
Use of e-mail and Canvas are essential elements of this class. Successful completion of this
course requires that you record a language sample from your EL student for transcription and

English, and (2) the linguistic development of bilingual EL per the analysis of a language sample
from a tutoring session with EL. Language samples will include approximately 10 minutes of
discussion around an academic topic. Claims made in the linguistic analyses must be supported
by references drawn from course readings. Final projects will consist of 7 discrete sections:
1. IntroductionA brief overview of your work with your student. Describe your student’s
    academic and linguistic background, any interesting features of your time spent together.
    (Max. 3/4 page)

         Language Sample, Working with Your EL Student, Linguistic Analysis Project
     1.  In the 2nd or 3rd week of your tutoring experience, you will record a language sample
         with your bilingual student.
     2.  You will not be interviewing your student, rather you will be recording a regular
         tutoring session. You will then transcribe this language sample, both your language and
         your student’s, and use this as the base of your linguistic analysis.
     3.  Print out a copy of your transcript and bring this to class with you. You will use the
         language elicited from the L2 learner to identify various linguistic features we examine
         in class. In class, we will workshop our transcripts, looking for examples of:
            a. Pragmatic competence
            b. Semantic development
            c. Phonological development
            d. Morphological development
            e. Syntactic development
     4.  As you work with your EL student throughout the semester, reflect on his/her language
         growth and development. At the end of the semester, you will evaluate your student’s
         English proficiency based on the SOLOM rubric. The SOLOM allows a teacher to
         observe an EL’s oral English skills in a natural context and identify the appropriate
         English language development stage through observation.
