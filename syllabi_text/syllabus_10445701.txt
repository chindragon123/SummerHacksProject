Course Description and Objectives
Course Description. This course examines ways to design learning experiences that highlight the social injustices in our
communities and gives people an opportunity to learn how to use the core ideas and practices of science, mathematics, and
engineering to make sense of them or to develop a solution to help address them. It focuses on three major questions that are
associated with current research on the development of instructional materials: (1) what are the types of interactions that take
place between people, ideas, and materials that foster learning in a way that is equitable and inclusive? (2) How can
instructional materials be designed to promote and support these types of interactions? And, (3) What criteria should be used
to determine if instructional materials are of high-quality? Students in this course will be expected to read and discuss articles
about the design of the instructional materials in STEM education and complete several projects. The projects include creating
a mathematics investigation, an engineering design challenge, and science unit.
Course Objectives. After participating in class activities and completing the assignments, you will be able to:
     1. Describe the nature of the interactions that take place between people, ideas, and materials that foster learning in a
          way that is equitable and inclusive;
     2. Describe design principles and instructional models than can be used to guide the development of new instructional
          materials;
     3. Create an Argument-Driven Mathematics investigation that examine a social injustice;
     4. Create an Argument-Driven Engineering STEM design challenge that will help make the world a better place;
     5. Create a Model-Driven Inquiry unit that examines a social injustice in a community; and,
     6. Evaluate and critique the design of instructional materials used in mathematics, engineering, and science.

Evaluation and Grades
Course Project (140 points possible). You will create three different types of instructional materials for the course project.
You must complete 14 milestones to finish this project by the end of the semester. These milestones are included in the table
below.
  Number      Milestone          What to Submit
  1           Math 1             Topic of the investigation, target standards, concepts and practices students will use
  2           Math 2             The investigation phenomenon, the guiding question, and an ideal argument
  3           Math 3             Draft of investigation handout, teacher notes, and any supplemental materials
  4           Math 4             Final version of investigation handout, teacher notes, and any supplemental materials
  5           Engineering 1      Topic of the challenge, target standards, concepts and practices students will use
  6           Engineering 2      The problem to solve, the criteria and constraints, and an ideal solution and argument
  7           Engineering 3      Draft of design challenge handout, teacher notes, and any supplemental materials
  8           Engineering 4      Final version design challenge handout, teacher notes, and any supplemental materials
  9           Science 1          Topic of the unit, target standards, DCIs, CCs and SEPs will use, and the phenomenon

  11          Science 3          Summary table
  12          Science 4          Draft of 50% of tasks and teacher notes
  13          Science 5          Draft of remaining 50% of tasks and teach notes
  14          Science 6          Final version of the unit (due July 13th)
Each milestone is worth ten points. Five points will be deducted from the points awarded for that milestone if the milestone
is not completed on time. Please note that a degree in education is not only about learning the content involved in the
discipline (such as learning theories or means of assessment). It is also about learning how to think and write in an academic
fashion. Your manuscript will be evaluated, not only in terms of content and the soundness of one’s ideas, but also in terms
of clarity of expression, conformity to academic styles of writing (such as APA format), and in terms of acknowledging the
origin of ideas (through use of appropriate citations). Please take this into account as you complete this project.
Reading Discussion Leader (10 points). You will lead the discussion of a set of readings during the semester. You will be
responsible for helping your team identify the big “takeaways” from the articles or chapters and your biggest “concern” that
will require more discussion. You will then prepare a summary of the big takeaways from the reading after class and then
share them with the rest of your team.
Grading Scale. The grading scale for this class is as follows:
    Letter                                   Letter                                 Letter
                     Percentage                                Percentage                             Percentage
    Grade                                    Grade                                  Grade
      A                 ≥ 91%                  B-           < 83% and ≥ 80%           D+           < 70% and ≥ 67%
      A-          < 91% and ≥ 89%              C+           < 80% and ≥ 77%           D            < 67% and ≥ 63%
     B+           < 89% and ≥ 87%               C           < 77% and ≥ 73%           D-           < 63% and ≥ 60%
      B           < 87% and ≥ 83%              C-           < 73% and ≥ 70%            F                 < 60%
Special Notices and Policies
Accessible and Inclusive Learning Environment. The university is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive
learning environment consistent with university policy and federal and state law. Please let me know if you experience any
barriers to learning so I can work with you to ensure you have equal opportunity to participate fully in this course. If you
are a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, and need accommodations please contact Services for


Students with Disabilities (SSD). Please refer to SSD’s website for contact and more information:
http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/. If you are already registered with SSD, please deliver your Accommodation Letter to
me as early as possible in the semester so we can discuss your approved accommodations and needs in this course.
Religious Holy Days. Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If you miss an
examination, work assignment, or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day you will be given an opportunity
to complete the work missed within a reasonable amount of time after the absence. It is the policy of the University of Texas
at Austin that you must notify the instructor at least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on the days you will be absent
to observe a religious holy day.
University of Texas Honor Code. The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values
through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community. Students are expected to abide by the
University of Texas Honor Code. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from The University. Since such dishonesty harms
the individual, all students, and the integrity of The University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. All
work on papers should be done individually. Any material that you include that is not in your own words must be cited clearly
as to its source. Likewise, you should give credit for ideas that originate from another source. Using another person’s words
or ideas (including words and ideas from the Internet!) without due credit is plagiarism and is a violation of University rules.
Writing Center. The Undergraduate Writing Center (FAC 211, 471-6222) offers free, individualized, expert help with writing
for any UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis. Consultants can help you develop strategies to improve your
writing, or simply provide feedback (this is a normal part of the writing process). See http://www.uwc.utexas.edu for more
information.
Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence to Students. All students should become familiar with the University's official
e-mail student notification policy. It is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or her
e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-
related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be
checked daily. The complete policy is available at: http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL). If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the
Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is
provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC),
the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or

Emergency Evacuation Policy. Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble
outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Take valuables with you if you can gather them quickly.
Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
     • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building.
     • If you require assistance to evacuate, inform the instructor in writing during the first week of class.
     • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instructor’s instructions.
     • Do not re-enter a building unless the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire
           Prevention Services office gives you instructions to do so.
     • Please familiarize yourself with procedures in case of an active shooter: http://www.utexas.edu/police/videos/
Q drop Policy. The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six (6).
As stated in Senate Bill 1231: “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit
an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has dropped at
another institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
Syllabus Change Policy. Except for changes that substantially affect implementation of the evaluation (grading) statement,
this syllabus is a guide for the course and is subject to change with advance notice.
