                ANS 302 K / ANT 310L 5: Introduction to South Asia
                                                   Fall 2019
                                            Instructor: Dr. Claire Maes
Course Description
This course is an introduction to South Asian cultures and histories. Students will be introduced to major
thinkers, ideas, histories, issues, and movements of South Asia. While a clear set of factual information
will be integral to the course, the equally important goal of the course is to learn to understand South
Asian literatures, art, religion, law, or other cultural expressions as sources for our own humanistic and
ethical development. Thus, the primary goal of this course is to train students in how to “read” South Asia
in such a way that it can mean something to them.
Goals
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
- describe the diversity and richness of South Asian history, culture, and ideas
- name and discuss important figures in South Asian history and today
- identify different regions and religions practiced in South Asia
- express major areas of political and cultural concern in South Asia today

Global Cultures
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your
familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least
one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Class Policies
Come to class on time. During class, all electronic devices must be switched off or put on silent mode.
Since using a laptop distracts oneself and other students, laptops may not be used in class either.
University Policies
Honor Code: The core values of UT Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through
integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Scholastic Dishonesty and Academic Integrity: Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic
credit will be the student's own work. Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are
subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. “Scholastic dishonesty” includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying
academic records, and any act designed to give unfair academic advantage to the student (such as, but
not limited to, submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor, providing false or misleading information in an effort to receive a
postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment), or the attempt to commit such an
act. For further information please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site:

Documented Disability Statement: UT Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for
Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 232-2937 (video phone) or

Religious Observances: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen
days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a
                                                                                                               2


work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Mental Health Resources: Mental health concerns such as anxiety, stress, and depression are very
common among college students. If you are struggling with any of these or other mental health concerns,
you are not alone! I encourage you to seek help and to encourage others who need help to do so. There
is a 24/7 Crisis Line for UT students: 512-471-CALL (2255). Additionally, the UT Counseling and Mental
Health Center (CMHC) can be reached at 512-471-3515 during regular hours. There are a variety of self-
care programs (MindBody Labs, etc.) available to students in addition to more traditional counseling
services.
