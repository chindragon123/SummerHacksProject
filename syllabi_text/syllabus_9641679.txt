Course Description: The goals of this course are to improve students’ skills in writing,
speaking and reading in Italian, as well as to increase their level of comprehension (both
reading and listening). We will review grammatical structures and elaborate the more
complex ones. Furthermore, we aim at expanding the students’ knowledge of Italian
culture through the use of videos and through live interaction with Italians whom students
will encounter in Rome. Specific grammatical structures will be reviewed and studied in
each section. This course is conducted in Italian.
We will reach these goals by:
a. Reading short stories and fairy tales
b. Reviewing grammatical structures through Radio Arlecchino and the course packet;
c. Listening to a variety of audio material, watching videos and two movies online;
d. Preparing oral reports and presentations;
e. Writing compositions on themes studied during the summer;
f. Conducting interviews with Italians outside of class.
The success of this course relies heavily on a learning environment that is welcoming to
all people. Each one of us will work hard to establish a strong sense of community based
upon respect, collaboration, and freedom of expression not only in the classroom, but also
in our new city and summer home, Rome.

grande bellezza. How are they similar and different? What do the two modes of
