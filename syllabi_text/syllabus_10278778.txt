Course Description: Climate change has impacted human societies over the course of human
existence on the planet. It has played a role in everything from hominin evolution to the rise and
fall of civilizations through to the present day economic and ethical decision-making. In this
course we will examine why climate changes, the methods for recording climate change, and
discuss case studies of the varied responses of past human societies to climate change in different
geographic regions and time periods with varying socio-political and economic systems. We will
explore aspects of resilience and rigidity of societies and issues of environmental sustainability
in the past as well as the present. Finally, we will compare and contrast modern responses to
climate change on a global scale with those of past societies.
Goals: To familiarize students with the evidence for climate change and methods of climate
change research; to increase their understanding of the social, economic and technological issues
human societies faced in the past when dealing with climate change. To understand what were
adaptive and maladaptive human strategies. To help students evaluate the modern politics and
social responses to climate change. On successful completion of this course a student should
understand how climate change is recorded and the basic climatic record for the period of human
occupation of the earth. To be familiar with current debates about how human societies adapt to
climate change. To be able to think critically about issues and arguments proposed in the
literature, and to write a coherent essay arguing a point of view.
Flags:
Ethics
This course carries the Ethics flag. Ethics courses are designed to equip you with skills that are
necessary for making ethical decisions in your adult and professional life. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments involving ethical issues and
the process of applying ethical reasoning to real-life situations.
                                                                                                   1


Global Cultures
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and
histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Requirements: The class will have regular lectures and class discussions; student participation is
required. Students are expected to attend regularly all classes, complete the assigned readings in
advance of class, and come ready to discuss readings or topics.
In addition to consistent classroom attendance and active participation, each student must
complete all of the following:
        1) Three in-class quizzes (10% each = 30% total) (Dates: Feb 19th, March 25th, and
            April 27th 2020)
        2) A short (3 minute) in-class presentation concerning the impact of climate change on
            past societies, and ethics of adapting to climate change (20%) (April 29th, May 4th,
            and May 6th. – attendance at all three sessions mandatory for all students).
        3) A one or two-page written review of a “peer-reviewed” article or book chapter – not
            an unpublished Internet article from the web – on a topic related to archaeology and
            climate change (10%). DUE DATE: 5:00pm, Thursday, February 20th, 2020.
        4) A five-page Term Paper on a topic concerning ethical issues of combating global
            climate change, past, present or future (30%). DUE DATE: 5:00pm, Thursday,
            April 23rd, 2020.
        5) Class participation (i.e. active involvement in discussions, attendance, etc.) will count
            for 10% of the final grade. Please Note. Attendance is considered part of class
            participation.
Policy on late assignments: A late assignment will only be accepted with prior approval from
the instructor. In this case, only a one-week extension of the deadline will be granted and 50% of
the points possible may be deducted from the final assignment grade, at the discretion of the
instructor.
Grading Scale: Grades will be determined based on the following designation. Please note: to
ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus,
a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not recognize
the grade of A+.
A = 94-100; A- = 90-93; B+ = 87-89; B = 84-86; B- = 80-83; C+ = 77-79; C = 74-76;
C- = 70-73; D+ = 67-69; D = 64-66; D- = 60-63; F = 0-59.
                                                                                                   2

Senate Bill 212 and Title IX Reporting Requirements. Under Senate Bill 212 (SB 212), the
professor and TAs for this course are required to report for further investigation any information
concerning incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking
committed by or against a UT student or employee. Federal law and university policy also
requires reporting incidents of sex- and gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct

about any such incidents that you share with us. If you need to talk with someone who can
maintain confidentiality, please contact University Health Services (512-471-4955 or 512-475-
6877) or the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center (512-471-3515 or 512-471-2255). We
strongly urge you make use of these services for any needed support and that you report any
Title IX incidents to the Title IX Office.
