ARH301: Introduction to the Visual Arts (19355)
Instructor: Deirdre M. Smith​ ​deirdresmith@utexas.edu
Class meetings: MWF 9:00-10:00 am / ART 1.120
Office hours: Mondays 10:00-11:00 / ​DFA 2.108 (​and by appointment)
          This course is a thematic survey that will introduce you to topics in the history of art and
visual culture. We will look at images, objects, buildings and films from around the world, from
ancient times to the present. Together we will examine the nature of art and artists, the ways
that art both reflects and influences its historical moment, and the personal, social, political, and
spiritual functions of art. Through this course, you will develop skills of visual literacy, critical
thinking and writing.
          THERE IS NO TEXTBOOK FOR THIS COURSE. On certain weeks you will have
assigned readings, which will be available in the Files section on Canvas. The rest of the class
material will come exclusively from lectures, so attendance, note-taking, and participation are
essential for success. Slide shows from lectures will be made available on Canvas within 24
hours of lecture.
          Outside of assigned readings, The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History
(​https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/​) and Oxford Art Online
(​http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/​) can serve as helpful resources.
Although not everything we cover in class can be found there, you can search for: artist names,
artistic movements, etc. and often find short, encyclopedia-style articles on them in one or the
other location.

                                 ASSIGNMENTS & GRADES​:
        Three Exams (non-cumulative) (each worth 10% of final grade) = 30%
        Exams will consist of: multiple choice and fill-in-the blank questions and short answer
questions (1-2 paragraphs each). Most of the short answer questions will be provided the Friday
before the exam as a take-home. The multiple choice and a few of the short answers will remain
unknown until exam day and are to be completed in a Blue Book.
        Three Writing Assignments (each worth 10% of final grade) = 30%
Format:
2-3 pages in length, Times New Roman font, 12 pt., 1 inch margins. Prompts and guidelines for
each assignment will be available on Canvas.
Rubric for Writing Assignments:
                10, 9 points - EXCELLENT - Dedication of time and thought are evident.
                Responds fully to prompt. Makes an effort at presenting a specific point of
                view or argument. Clear, concise writing. Virtually no spelling or
                grammatical errors.
                                                                                                4


                 8, 7 points - GOOD - Thoughtful, but insufficiently forceful in presentation
                 of ideas, or does not fully address all aspects of assignment. Writing may
                 be unclear or have some errors.
                 6 - NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - Inadequate level of thought and
                 consideration of assignment. Major problems with formatting or
                 mechanics of writing.
         Three Reading Assignments (each worth 5% of final grade) = 15%
         At the beginning of each unit (the start of the semester or the week following an exam)
you will be assigned a selection of readings. You will need to read these, and then write
responses to short answer questions provided on Canvas. The list of readings and files will all
be provided on Canvas.
         Five “In-Class Activities” (each worth 3% of final grade) = 15%
         These are interactive and active learning assignments that will take place throughout the
semester. With the exception of the first one, these will happen outside of the classroom. An
assignment will unlock on Canvas in the morning and ask you to go somewhere on campus or
in the city (the Blanton Museum, a certain building or area, etc.). You will have to answer
questions about buildings, art objects or experiences on Canvas.
         Attendance and Participation = 10%
         Active presence (daily attendance, taking notes, responding to questions, not talking or
using your phone) in class are expected of all students.
         Excused absences will be provided in cases of illness, family emergency, religious
observation, etc. provided ideally at least one week in advance. Plan to get lecture notes from a
fellow student, and to meet with the instructor to cover what you missed when necessary.
Rubric for Attendance and Participation grade:
For full credit in this portion of the grade, you are expected to:
         -Attend the majority of lectures (i.e. No more than 3 unexcused absences)
         -Be attentive and present during class (i.e. Not on your phone or chatting - I will mark
         you down as absent for the day if I notice you doing either of these things)
         -Participate in discussion (i.e. You are expected to respond to and ask questions,
         participate in group discussions, and otherwise take an active part in learning)
         Extra Credit (up to two points added on to final grade)
         Extra credit points can be earned by attending visual arts-related cultural events. This
could be something in Austin, or another city you happen to visit. To receive credit, you must
email me a brief description of your experience (where you went, what you thought, if it
reminded you of any topics or images from class) along with a photograph taken there. Below is
a list of suggestions, but feel free to explore something beyond this list. You have until the day
after the final (December 10th at midnight) to submit.
                                                                                                   5


                                      Suggestions for Extra Credit:
On campus
--Exhibition, ​Charles White and the Legacy of the Figure: Celebrating the Gordon Gift​ at the
Christian Greene Gallery (located in Jester)
--Exhibition, ​Lingua Franca: Black Spirit in Common Tongue​ at the Idea Lab (210 East 24th
Street, Gordon White Building)
--See the James Turrell Skyspace on the roof of the Student Activity Center
https://turrell.utexas.edu/​ (Make a reservation here for the sunset light sequence, or go during
the day)
In Austin
--Exhibition, ​The Sorcerer’s Burden: Contemporary Art and the Anthropological Turn​ at the
Contemporary (700 Congress Avenue, Austin)
--The Laguna Gloria (3809 West 35th Street, Austin)
--Mexic-Arte Museum (419 Congress Avenue)
--Exhibition, ​Preetika Rajgariah​ at Women & Their Work (1710 Lavaca Street)
Final grades will be determined on the following +/- scale:
A (4.00) = 94-100; A- (3.67) = 90-93; B+ (3.33) = 87-89; B (3.00) = 84-86; B- (2.67) = 80-83;
C+ (2.33) = 77-79; C (2.00) = 74-76; C- (1.67) = 70-73; D+ (1.33) = 67-69; D (1.00) = 64-66;
D- (0.67) = 60-63; F (0.00) = 0-59
NOTE: I​ f you are .50 or less away from a boost that would shift you into a different grade, I will
always round up. For example, a 93.50 (A-) will become 94 (A) in the final grade.
Academic Honesty:
         I expect all students in this class to act with integrity. I have set up the course in a way
that should make cheating impossible (and, moreover, irrelevant). HOWEVER, I will take
evidence of cheating on exams and quizzes (copying another student’s work, sharing answers,
etc.) very seriously and will give 0s on assignments where such activity has taken place.
         Almost none of the assignments in this course will require research. They are based on
your own thoughts and observations. Therefore plagiarism should not be an issue. However, if
you do reference either a class reading or outside material, you MUST cite it using whatever
style you are familiar with (MLA, Chicago, etc.)
         For more on the UT Honor Code (or statement of ethics) and an explanation or example
of what constitutes plagiarism, see: ​http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi09-10/ch01/index.html​)
Visual and Performing Arts Credit (VAPA):
This course can be used to fulfill the Visual and Performing Arts requirement of UT’s core
curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by the Texas Higher
                                                                                                      6


Education Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking skills, teamwork, and social
responsibility.
Global Cultures flag:
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase
your familiarity and knowledge of cultures outside the United States. A substantial portion of the
material will cover practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. culture.
