Course Objectives
  Managerial accounting is concerned with the use of accounting information by managers to plan and control
  (evaluate) personnel and operations of the firm. This course is intended as an introduction for individuals who
  will make business decisions, evaluate business opportunities, and evaluate others (or be evaluated) through the
  use of accounting systems. Throughout the course, we will discuss the two important roles of managerial
  accounting: the decision-facilitating role and the decision-influencing role.
  Managerial accounting information can facilitate decision-making by providing information about the benefits
  and costs of the goods and services sold by the firm. We will discuss and apply principles which will guide our
  evaluation and design of planning information systems. We will observe that financial accounting systems require
  that information be accumulated in particular ways for external reporting which are often not helpful for
  managerial decision making. Thus, we will learn techniques to enhance the usefulness of accounting information
  to facilitate short-term operational and long-term strategic decisions.
  Managerial control systems can influence decisions by assisting in the motivation and coordination of individuals
  and organizational units through performance evaluation and incentive systems. When discussing managerial
  control systems, we will explicitly recognize that individuals respond to methods used for performance
  measurement and reward. We will also discuss systems that have widespread use, examine the motivation and
  theoretical underpinnings for that use, and identify how and when the misuse of these systems leads to
  dysfunctional outcomes for the firm.
  In addition to enhancing understanding of managerial accounting systems, this course will help to develop other
  essential skills critical to achieving success in the business environment. In particular, we will work to enhance
  analytical skills, written and oral communication skills, and the ability to work in teams.

Grading
                  Class Attendance and Participation                           10%
                  Homework assignments (Lowest 2 dropped)                      15%
                  Group Project (Proposal 15%; Presentation 5%)                20%
                  Midterm Exam                                                 25%
                  Final Exam (cumulative)                                      30%
                  Total                                                      100%
  Letter grades will be determined based on your class grade averages using the following cutoffs:
  > 93% = A, 90-93% = A-, 87-90% = B+, 84-87% = B, 80-84% = B-, 77-80% = C+, 74-77% = C, etc.
  I reserve the right to adjust the grading scale in the students’ favor. There will typically be no opportunities to
  raise your course grade by doing "extra credit" work either before or after the end of the semester.
  Grade Appeals
  If you believe a grading error has occurred, you must appeal within one week after the related grade has been
  posted on Canvas. Please submit a written explanation of your concern to me. After one week has passed, no
  appeals will be considered.
Class Attendance and Participation
  Your class participation grade will be determined based on both your attendance and in-class contributions,
  during lecture sessions and especially during case study sessions.
  The purpose of the business cases is to prepare you for important decisions that you could face in your future
  career. To enhance the learning environment, everyone is expected to actively participate in class discussions.
  Being an active participant in class discussions requires a thorough reading and understanding of the case and
  completion of the related homework assignment.
  I will cold call as a standard practice. After each class, I will make class participation notes, with particular
  attention to the quality of comments and not just the quantity.
Homework Assignments
  A homework assignment will be due before the start of most class sessions. The purpose of the homework
  assignments is to prepare you to learn the important lessons of the class session. Accounting is best learned by
  “doing” and keeping up on a regular basis is the best strategy for both learning and preparing for examinations.
  There will be a total of 23 homework assignments. Details of each homework assignment can be found on
  Canvas and the due dates are listed in the course schedule at the end of the syllabus. Your lowest two scores will
  be dropped and the scores on the remaining 21 assignments will count towards your final grade.
  Textbook chapter homework assignments are due at 5pm on Friday following the related lecture. These
  homework assignments are to be completed on Canvas.
  Case study homework assignments are due 9am before class on the day of the related case study. These
  homework assignments are to be submitted on Canvas electronically in PDF format. For all written memos,
  please use the following standard format: one-inch margins, single spaced, 12 point, Times New Roman font.


Professor Eric Chan                           ACC312H — Spring 2020                                            Page 3
  The system is set up such that no homework can be submitted after the deadline. Late assignments will NOT be
  accepted and will automatically receive a score of zero.
  Homework will be graded on a scale of 5. Textbook chapter homework assignments are in a quiz format and
  contain 5 multiple-choice problems that are worth 1 point each. Case study homework assignments contain both
  quantitative and qualitative problems.
  Qualitative homework problems will be graded subjectively. Submissions that are judged to be completed
  with care will receive at least a grade of 3. Submissions that are incomplete or do not present a reasonable,
  well-written approach in the judgment of the TA or me will receive lesser grades.
  Verbal collaboration on homework is allowed. However, the submitted assignment should be entirely your
  own work. Please do NOT borrow, copy, or transfer answers or files from anyone else. Completing your own
  homework assignment is the only way you will learn the material. Students who submit identical homework
  assignments will receive a score of zero.
Exams
  Exams will be individually-completed, closed-book exams. The exams will cover material from assigned
  chapters in the textbook, case studies, lectures, and in-class discussions. They typically consist of multiple
  choice questions and short answer questions.
  The midterm exam will be administered in the evening for all sections of ACC 312H. Students with a regularly
  scheduled class during the exam time will be permitted to take the exam after the scheduled time. Otherwise, no
  make-up exam will be given. Medical and family emergencies are the only valid reasons for missing the exam. In
  such instances, you must provide prompt notification and documentation to Student Emergency Services
  (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/). If you miss the exam and you have a valid and documented reason
  for missing it, your final exam will replace the missing midterm exam grade.
  The final exam is cumulative, but will emphasize material covered after the midterm. There will be a common
  final exam for all sections of ACC 312H, and the university will confirm the time and location of the exam later
  in the semester. Please do not make travel arrangements until you are certain of your exam schedule. No
  early exams will be given for any reason.
  The final exam grade, if better, will be averaged with the midterm exam grade and will replace the
  midterm exam grade. This gives students a final opportunity to improve their overall grade.
Group Project
  You will be randomly assigned to groups of 3 to 4 students at the beginning of the semester. Your group will
  write and present a proposal to start a new business venture on campus.
  There are three key learning objectives associated with this project. First, you will learn to apply the course
  material in a real-world setting. This allows you to better appreciate the different business decisions that
  managers face and how management accounting systems can help managers make more informed business
  decisions. Second, you will learn to collaborate with others and work in a team. In any future career that you
  choose to pursue, you will have to work well with others. (See “Tips for Working in a Group” in the guidelines
  document) Third, you will gain practice in giving formal business presentations. The ability to present well is a
  skill critical to your future success.


Professor Eric Chan                           ACC312H — Spring 2020                                            Page 4
  Group Proposal (15%)
  As a group, you will write a business proposal to showcase the various management accounting methods and
  techniques you have learned throughout this course.
  Your group proposal will be graded based on the quality and accuracy of the analyses performed, the organization
  and clarity of the writing, and the practicality and creativity of the business idea.
  Please see the Group Project Guidelines document on Canvas for details of the required deliverables and due
  dates. Please submit all documents electronically via Canvas.
  Group Presentation (5%)
  Each group will give a 15-minute presentation of its proposal (see course schedule). Your peers will have an
  opportunity to ask you questions about your proposed business after your presentation.
  Your group presentation will be graded based on its content and organization, your level of preparation, the
  effectiveness of communication, and the use of visual aids.
  Peer Evaluations
  Group members are expected to contribute to the overall group project equally. You will have the
  opportunity to conduct peer evaluations of your group members at the end of the project. Based on your
  collective responses, I will use my discretion to adjust the individual grade of any group member, particularly
  those who have not contributed a reasonable share to the group project.
Communication
  The use of Canvas is required for this course. It is your responsibility during the first week of class to ensure that
  you can access the class site on Canvas. Printing out the class notes and bringing them to class will allow you to
  better follow along with our class discussions.
  I will frequently make announcements and communicate with the class via Canvas. If you want to update your
  email address in Canvas, go to your UT Direct page and, under personal info/all my addresses, change your email
  address.
  My TA and I have regularly scheduled office hours for consultation on matters pertaining to the course. Students
  are encouraged to take advantage of these hours to discuss their problems and to secure assistance where needed
  throughout the semester. You can also email me or the TA with any questions you have at anytime.


Professor Eric Chan                            ACC312H — Spring 2020                                           Page 5
McCombs Classroom Professionalism Policy
   The highest professional standards are expected of all members of the McCombs community. The collective class
   reputation and the value of the Business Honors Program experience hinges on this. Faculty are expected to be
   professional and prepared to deliver value for each class session. Students are expected to be professional in all
   respects. The BHP classroom experience is enhanced when you:
     •   Arrive on time. On time arrival ensures that classes are able to start and finish at the scheduled time. On
         time arrival shows respect to others and enhances learning by reducing avoidable distractions.
     •   Minimize unscheduled personal breaks. The learning environment improves when disruptions are
         limited.
     •   Prepare fully for each class. Much of the learning in the BHP program takes place during classroom
         discussions. When participants are not prepared they cannot contribute to the overall learning process. This
         affects not only the individual, but their peers who count on them, as well.
     •   Attend the class section to which you are registered. Learning is enhanced when class sizes are
         optimized. Limits are set to ensure a quality classroom experience. If, on a particular day, you need to
         attend a section other than the one to which you are registered, please inform me prior to class.
     •   Respect the views and opinions of your colleagues. Disagreement and debate are encouraged. Intolerance
         for the views of others is unacceptable.
     •   Put away all electronic devices not used for note-taking purposes (e.g., your cell phones). All class
         participants are expected to devote their full attention to the topic at hand. When participants become a
         distraction to themselves and others, they are doing themselves and their peers a major disservice.
Other Important Notifications

Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity and
Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259,
http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/.
Please provide copies of approved accommodation letters within the first two weeks of class so that I can make
the appropriate arrangements.
Diversity and Inclusion
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that
students’ learning needs be addressed and that the diversity that students bring to this class can be comfortably
expressed and be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit to all students. Please come to me at any time with any
concerns.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in
order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time after the absence.


Professor Eric Chan                            ACC312H — Spring 2020                                           Page 6
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both
students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the BBA Program’s Statement
on Scholastic Dishonesty at http://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics. By teaching this course, I have
agreed to observe all faculty responsibilities described there. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe
all student responsibilities described there. If the application of the Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to this
class or its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all
students, the integrity of the University, and the value of our academic brand, policies on scholastic dishonesty
will be strictly enforced. You should refer to the Student Judicial Services website at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/ to access the official University policies and procedures on scholastic
dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to: copying work on tests or assignments, representing (copying)
the work of another person as one’s own or allowing another person to represent your work as their own,
collaborating without authority with another student during an exam or in preparing academic work, using or
having on your desk unauthorized material or aids to complete a quiz, group exercise, or exam (e.g., cheat sheets,
solutions, graphing or programmable calculators, cell phones, etc.).
IT’S NOT WORTH IT! ALL acts of academic dishonesty receive significant penalties and are reported to
Student Judicial Services and attach to your record. This record is consulted as part of application processes at UT
(e.g., study abroad applications) and after (e.g., law school and MBA applications, which generally require you to
provide access to this record).
Campus Safety
Please note the following key recommendations regarding emergency evacuation, provided by the Office of
Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, More info at: https://preparedness.utexas.edu/.
•    Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
     and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated.
•    Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
•    If you need evacuation assistance, inform the instructor in writing asap.
•    In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
•    Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by Austin or UT police or fire authorities.
•    Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050 or on-line.
•    In case of emergency, further information will be available at: http://www.utexas.edu/emergency.

BBA Recruiting Conflicts
Conflicts occasionally arise between classes and the search for employment. We understand how important the job
search process is to you, and McCombs provides many resources in support of career exploration and search.
However, UT is first and foremost an educational institution and your BBA degree will be the credential that
certifies your education. As such, education will take precedent whenever such a conflict arises.
All companies that recruit at McCombs are informed of this fact. Should a conflict arise, we recommend the
following steps:
    •    Check the syllabus to see if an exception is provided that would allow you to satisfy class obligations while
         still attending the job event (e.g., paper instead of quiz, allowed quiz drops, etc).
    •    Note that a job-related conflict, whether a current job or a potential one, is usually not an acceptable reason
         for missing an exam or taking a make-up, and may not be acceptable in other circumstances either. If any
         doubt exists, check with your professor.
    •    If no exception is provided, inform the company that an academic conflict exists and request an
         accommodation.
    •    If no accommodation is provided, contact BBA Career Services and request their assistance in resolving the
         situation.
Note that while we do have influence with the companies that recruit at McCombs, not all conflicts can be resolved
and we have little or no influence with companies that do not recruit through the Recruit McCombs system.
Finally, be aware that it is not unreasonable for an employer to expect you to go to some lengths to show your
interest in them. In a recent example, several students completed an exam at 9 pm and were expected to attend an
on-site interview in Houston the next morning at 8 am. A 5:30 am flight from Austin was available and the students
were expected to be on it. This is reasonable, and if you think it is unfair, you probably need to reconsider what you
believe are the reasonable expectations of a good job and career in business.
