Instructor: Dr. Mónica A. Jiménez
                                 COURSE DESCRIPTION:
The Caribbean, oft thought of as a tropical playground, a place to vacation, to enjoy and
consume, has also produced some of the greatest artists and thinkers of the 20th century. The
region’s unique political and social history served as the catalyst for some of the foremost
poets, painters, writers and thinkers of anticolonial thought and surrealist art. This course is
concerned with understanding how the region’s history helped to shape artists and thinkers
such as Aimé and Suzanne Césiaire, René Depestre, Sylvia Wynter, Wifredo Lam and Carmen
Herrera and how their work continues to resonate into the 21st century.

The course has several objectives:
        1) To deepen our understanding of the rich intellectual history of the Caribbean.
        2) To understand how the history of the region has led to its construction as a place
        of leisure and extraction rather than of intellectual and cultural production.
        3) To explore alternative frameworks that might enhance our understanding of the
        histories of the people of the Caribbean as integral to our understanding of African
        Diaspora Studies.
        4) To strengthen student critical thinking and writing through focused study.
This course carries the Writing Flag.
