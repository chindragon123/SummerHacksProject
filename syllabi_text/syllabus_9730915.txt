COURSE DESCRIPTION: ARE 320K 'INTRODUCTION TO DESIGN 1'
                  (Part 1 of a required 2-course sequence)
Introduction to current (architectural) engineering design issues, design concepts, principles, and
problem-solving approaches.
Nine laboratory hours a week for one semester.
Prerequisite: Credit or registration for Architectural Engineering 217.
COURSE OBJECTIVE
To teach the integration of architecture + engineering + construction concepts during the early
stages of the building design process.
ACADEMIC / LEARNING GOALS:
A. An understanding of the current profession of architectural engineering (recent history, firms
and projects).
B. Critical-thinking skills - an understanding that design problems have multiple solutions - how to
generate multiple solutions and choose the best answer.
C. Problem solving skills, particularly the engineering aspects of an architectural project, including
artistic concepts, site and cultural issues, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, facade
technology, energy and sustainability issues.
D. Collaboration tools, preparing students to be productive members of a building design and
construction team.
E. Communication skills: develop verbal skills, writing skills, sketching, computer drawing, model-
making (physical and digital), time-management and productivity skills, all necessary for a career
in architectural engineering.
F. Be exposed to many aspects of the profession, which will help each student to better decide
on their own future academic and professional direction.

SEMESTER OUTLINE OF PROJECTS:
(individual student work, unless noted otherwise)
A. First Principles Project (9 weeks)
Weekly seminars focusing on a different fundamental aspect of design each week.
- Sketching
- Preliminary design methods with digital tools.
- Architecture theory, design.
- Climate design.
- Structure: gravity system.
- Structure: lateral system.
- Mechanical system.
- Water and Electric systems.
- Construction technologies.
First half of week: basic principles.
Second half of week: students apply these principles to an example project.
Design tools: see List of Supplies (at end of this document) + SketchUp and Revit.
B. Semester Project (6 weeks)
Topic: Compact mid-rise tower.
Now familiar with First Principles, student will individually design a building and it’s systems and
model the project in Revit. PDF package of drawings is due on Last Class Day.
Design tools: Sketching and Revit.
C. AEWorldMap Project (ongoing during semester)
www.aeworldmap.com

Project Grades and Final Grades will utilize +/- additions (Ex: B+)
GRADE EVALUATIONS:
Grading in a design studio is different from other courses. Project grades are based on each
student's understanding of course material as exhibited in the final products of each assignment.
Asking for help with a project:
Each student is expected to ask for assistance when needed, and engage in problem-solving
discussions with their peers, the TA and the instructor. The TA or instructor may be approached
at any time during class for assistance, or you can schedule additional time to sit down privately
to solve a design problem with either the TA or the instructor.
'A' Grades:
Only students who exhibit exceptional effort and strong design skill level will get an ‘A’ grade.
'B' Grades:
Completing the assignments with above average effort and skill level is rewarded by a ‘B’ grade.
'C' Grades and lower:
Projects that are late, incomplete or show only average effort and skill will lead to a ‘C’ grade or
lower.
To check on your overall grade during the semester:
Intermittent overall grade status will be available upon request but must be understood to be an
estimate. Final grades are available only near the end of the semester as your work will be
compared to all other student efforts over the entire semester.


                                                    8 of 10
CLASS ATTENDANCE:
Class attendance is used to determine the course grade. Students are expected to be on-time, to
attend every class session, and should not leave class early unless approved by the instructor.
Lateness or absence can be excused if the student sends an email to the instructor before the
start of class, stating their reason.
UT policy regarding religious holidays:
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence
as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable
time after the absence.
IN-CLASS PRODUCTIVITY / COMMUNICATION:
Students are expected to contribute to a productive, professional working environment in the
studio/classroom. Students are expected to help each other during studio, participate in class
discussions, and show progress regularly to the TA and instructor. Students are expected to
clean up their workspace at the end of each class day.
GRADE REDUCTION FOR NON-PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR IN STUDIO.
Professional courtesy and behavior is required during class, and grade reductions will occur after
2 recorded infractions. Examples of non-professional behavior include:
- Texting, or other personal use of digital devices (phones, tablets, etc.) during class-time.
- Use of class-time or university equipment for non-studio-related assignments during class-time.
- Disruptive or negative behavior during class-time.
Students will receive a verbal warning the first time this is a problem. If the problem continues a
second time, an email warning will be issued by the instructor with an offer to discuss the
problem. Any additional instances will result in a one-step reduction of the student's final grade.
For example, due to a third instance, a student's final grade is reduced from A- to B+ and so on.
DEADLINES:
Deadlines for projects are included on the Calendar (see last page of this syllabus). Minor
adjustments are often made to deadlines by the instructor in order to maintain a balanced
workload for the studio. If a deadline is changed, students will be notified in class, via email and
on the class blog.
Work that is due in which the rest of the students in the class or student team are dependent on,
will receive all or nothing credit. Otherwise, work due to the instructor will be down-graded one-
half grade each day of the week that it is late. Credit for projects turned in late due to non-
scholastic reasons may be negotiated with the instructor provided that an agreed upon proof of
the reason is provided by the student for accountability.
EMAIL / CLASS BLOG ENTRIES:
Email and/or the class blog (www.aestudio.info) will be used by the instructor to announce project
clarifications, modifications or tips. Students are expected to check email daily and are expected
to subscribe to the class blog.
STUDENT PROJECTS / TEACHING EXAMPLES:
Some projects or assignments may be kept by the instructor for use as future teaching examples,
public exhibits, or accreditation purposes. Students may make arrangements to pick up any such
materials upon graduation, or once the materials are no longer needed by their academic dept.
