Course Overview:
This lower-division, lecture course provides an overview of global development from
roughly 10,000 BCE to 1500 CE. It introduces students to the main political, social, and
cultural trends in a variety of societies while at the same time stressing the global
perspective. Considerable emphasis is therefore paid to comparative history and the
study of cross-cultural encounters. While covering the content of the human past, we will
also investigate methods of historical study to discover how history is constructed from
both material remains and written sources. "The Premodern World" thus aims to teach
historical thinking as well as historical content, impart a basic understanding of the
premodern past, and stimulate the development of large-scale frameworks for historical
analysis.
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
