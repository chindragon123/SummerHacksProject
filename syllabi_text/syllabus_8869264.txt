This course offers a survey of major religious traditions of Asia (Hinduism, Buddhism in South and East Asia,
Confucianism, Daoism, and Shinto). It focuses on the historical development of their beliefs, practices, rituals, and
customs in social context. The course will combine lectures with class discussions on readings. At the end of the
semester, students will have a basic knowledge of the beliefs and practices of those religious traditions, have read
important religious texts and discussed issues pertinent to the religions’ adherents, and have a more refined sense
of how the category “religion” may be applied. All this enables students to develop a greater awareness of global
cultural diversity and will, hopefully, spark the desire to study some of those religions more deeply.

Global Cultures flag
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your familiarity with
cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come
from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or
present.
