    •     “Law & Justice in the Bible” course pack (not needed until 2–3 weeks into the session).
Course Description
This course examines the legal traditions of the Torah (Pentateuch) and what they reveal about the
practice of law and justice in ancient Israel and the wider biblical world. It then explores the law and legal
systems of the broader ancient Near East in order to see how the biblical traditions relate to ideas and
practices attested in other societies in the region. Theories concerning ethics and justice will also be used
to provide context for understanding conceptions of law and justice in the ancient world and especially in
the Hebrew Bible. Legal topics such as marriage, family structures, litigation, debt, slavery, homicide,
theft, false accusation, contracts, and other matters will be examined. The course acquaints students with
how various biblical traditions developed over time to form the foundation for later rabbinic and Christian
ethical thought. (Flag: This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are
designed to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and
histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.)
Learning Outcomes
After completing this course, you will be able:
    1. To list the so-called law codes of the Hebrew Bible and to explain the background and basic nature
          of each
    2. To explain at least two major theories concerning the relationship of biblical law to other
          collections of law in the ancient Near East
    3. To define at least two major theories of ethics and/or justice and to describe how some aspects of
          biblical law may relate to these theories or can be analyzed by them
    4. To give examples of how modern scholars study biblical law and to suggest how such study
          might aid in understanding how biblical law may or may not be relevant for modern society


                                                                           Law & Justice in the Bible / Syllabus / page 2
Requirements, Assignments, and Grading – You will be graded out of 300 points possible for the session.
Class Participation (60 points; 20% of course grade). You are expected to attend class by attending our
Zoom sessions, to do the assigned readings, and to contribute regularly to discussions in class. You
should be prepared to answer questions about assigned readings and to offer questions and comments of
your own. Come to each class with at least two comments and two questions on the assigned readings.
We will meet over Zoom on June 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 29, 30, July 1, 2, 6, 7,
and 8. This means that there are four Fridays when we will not meet (June 12, 19, 26, and July 3).
Instead of meeting on those four days, you will participate in a discussion board on Canvas. Further
instructions will be distributed.
Friday Quizzes (60 points; 20% of course grade). There will be an online quiz in Canvas on four out of
the five Fridays during the session. Each quiz will cover assigned readings and material from in-class
lectures and discussions for that week. You may use your notes and books on the quizzes. But please do
not wait until Friday to start your reading. It will be important to keep up with the reading throughout the
week and to engage with me and your fellow students in discussion.
Essay (60 points; 20% of course grade). Students will submit one essay of 1400–1800 words. The essay
will cover a legal topic (e.g., debt, slavery, marriage, , inheritance, litigation) or text (from the Hebrew
Bible or from one of the law collections in the Roth textbook) that is relevant for the study of biblical and
ancient Near Eastern law. Further instructions will be distributed.
Midterm and Final Examinations (120 points; 40% of course grade). Both examinations will be worth 60
points. Examinations may consist of objective questions (e.g., multiple-choice questions) and/or essay
questions. Students who need to take an exam at a time other than the regularly scheduled time will be
required to take an essay exam.
Grading Scale
A student’s final course grade will be assigned based on the scale below, which shows percentage points
and corresponding letter grades. The professor also reserves the right slightly to raise or lower a student’s
grade, based on the professor’s perception of the student’s effort in the course.
