Description:
This course examines select novels by Nobel laureate and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, Toni Morrison. The novels thematize
womanism as theory in experiences uniquely shared by women across ethnic, class, and regional boundaries. Collectively,
Morrison's characters confront a wide range of challenging crises: infanticide, familial relationships and conflict, cultural survival,
etc. Morrison's novels are a gloss on the African-American literary tradition, deeply rooted in the American literary tradition.

Writing Flag:
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with writing in an academic
discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive
feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or more
assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your
grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking,
Communication, Teamwork, and Personal responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
Cultural Diversity in the U.S. Diversity:
This course carries the Flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity courses are designed to increase your
familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of
your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one U.S. cultural group that has
experienced persistent marginalization.
Required Reading (Texts): The Bluest Eye, 1970; Sula, 1973; Song of Solomon, 1977; Beloved, 1987; A Mercy 2008.
Audio-Visual Aids: Toni Morrison with Bill Moyers, History of Ideas Series; Toni Morrison on Beloved; Jazz and the Harlem
Renaissance; Beloved Film (excerpts from Harpo Productions); The Margaret Garner Opera (documentary).

.20 Critical citations / quizzes

.10 Group presentations
Grading Scale:


Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric. Please note that to ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute,
and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus, a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University
does not recognize the grade of A+.
A (94-100); A- (90-93); B+ (87-89); B (84-86); B- (80-83); C+ (77-79); C (74-76); C- (70-73); D+ (67-69); D (64-66); D- (60-63); F (0-59).
Plus/minus grades will be assigned for the final grade. This is a writing-intensive course. No final exam is given.
Attendance:
Regular attendance is required. More than four absences will be sufficient grounds for failure in the course. Penalties may range
from a reduction in overall course grade to failure of the course itself. I reserve the right to make decisions on a case-by-case basis.
The four allowed absences would include illness, deaths of relatives, and other emergencies. If you are more than five minutes late
or leave before class ends (without permission), you will be counted absent for that class. You are responsible for all work covered
in your absence. Read each novel completely by the first day of discussion for that book. No makeup for quizzes is permitted.
Course pack articles are required reading.
*The course contains select novels from the Toni Morrison literary canon. The subject of each class meeting may be determined
from the assigned reading for the day (see course schedule). The instructor retains the right to vary this syllabus.
Class Policies:
Absolutely no make-up for reading quizzes. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped. Except under extreme emergencies, and then
only with the permission of the professor, late assignments will not be accepted. I reserve the right to make these decisions on a
case-by-case basis. Students are expected to turn in all required assignments on the agreed upon due date at the beginning of class.
Read all material assigned before class time. Participation in class discussion is required. Papers turned in during or after class on
the due day will be considered late. Use the MLA (Modern Language Association) Stylebook for all papers. Type papers on white,
8.5" x 11" paper, using one side only. Bind pages with a paper clip.
