Course Description
How do societies understand illness? How do they restore good health?
In this course, we explore how communities have confronted disease throughout Africa’s history.
During the first half, we read about the changing role of specialist healers since the 1700s, including
shamans, malams, nurses, and drug peddlers. The second half of the course turns to the history of
specific diseases including malaria, AIDS, and Ebola through regional case studies. Particular
emphasis is placed on pre-colonial and traditional healing, medical education, colonial therapeutics,
and the impact of environmental change.
Throughout the course of the semester, participants will be able to hone their historical research skills
through primary source labs. The research labs will incorporate analysis of historical documents and
artifacts related to particular aspects of therapeutics and sickness in Africa.
Overall, this course offers participants a nuanced, historical perspective on the current health crisis in
Africa. Staggering figures place the burden of global disease in Africa; not only AIDS and malaria, but
also pneumonia, diarrhea and mental illness significantly affect the lives of everyday people. Studying
the history of illness and healing in African societies provides a framework with which to interpret the
social, political, and environmental factors shaping international health today.
No previous coursework in African history is expected. Course participants will make two oral and
written reports on weekly assignments. There will also be one longer research paper (8-10 pages) on
the history of a particular health concern.
Course Goals
After completing History 350L “Medicine in Africa” you should be able to:
1) Identify 3 key cultural influences on African healing strategies since the 1800s.
2) Describe generally the changing relationships between society, disease and environment in the
     context of 5 illnesses in African history.
3) Conduct basic research on the history of African health using multiple sources.
4) Describe in detail the history of a specific illness, or category of healing in an African country or
     region.

 Flags:
 This course fufills the requirements for a Global Cultures Flag. At least one third of the course
 content requires an in-depth examination of the broader cultural context and perspectives of one or
 more non-U.S. communities, countries, or coherent regional groupings of countries, past or present.
 It is also designated as fulfilling the requirements for a Writing Flag. At least one third of the course
 grade depends on writing. Course participants will produce regular written projects and receive
 feedback on their writing assignments from the instructor.
 Course Marking:
 Course participants are required to attend all class meetings and to contribute fully to discussions.
 Unexcused absences can result in the drop of half a letter grade (-5 points). Excused absences
 require advance notice to the instructor, or a written statement from a physician. Alert the instructor if
 you anticipate any conflict with course meetings for religious reasons.
 The overall grade for this course depends on active class participation and quality of written work:
     Contributions to class discussions and quizzes………40 points

Safety:
Please note that I do not allow students to carry concealed guns in my office, GAR 3.106 and may
remind you orally when you visit. You may make arrangements to speak with me by phone during my
office hours. While I am not permitted to ban concealed weapons in our classroom, please note that
you must be 21 and older and hold a license for a firearm. Licensed carriers must have the gun in a
holster on or about them. Openly carried weapons are not allowed on the UT campus. If a gun is visible
in class, faculty and students are advised to immediately call 911 and leave the room. For more
information on campus safety and campus-approved holsters, visit: http://campuscarry.utexas.edu/students
Description of Course Assignments:
Class Discussions (40 points)
        To prepare for class, set aside time to read the assigned books and articles at least two days in
        advance of the class meeting. Depending on how fast you read and your familiarity with
        historical texts and African history, it will take between 2 to 8 hours to digest the roughly 200
        pages for each week. You may find it helpful to type or write down questions and points of
        interest as you read or shortly afterwards. Be sure to print out any e-reserves and highlight
        key ideas.
        During class, each participant will have a chance to respond to the readings and raise questions
        and thoughts. Be considerate of others, but be sure your opinions are heard!
Oral Reports/Response Paper (20 points total)
        Each participant will make two brief reports on assigned readings throughout the course of the
        semester. Oral reports should be no more than 3 minutes in length.
        The idea is not to provide an exhaustive summary of readings. Rather aim to highlight the main
        points of each reading and explain any criticisms you have of the author’s approach. At the end
        of the oral report, provide a general question that links together all the week’s readings.
        Response papers are to be submitted the day of the class when oral reports are made on
        Canvas. Each response paper should be 1-2 pages double spaced (12 point font with 1 ½”
        margins). Each should be a well written, closely argued statement that synthesizes and
        connects the week’s readings. It is not necessary, however, to use any outside sources to
        supplement your discussion of the assigned books and/or articles.
Research Paper (40 points)
        Each participant is responsible for one mid-length paper on the history of a particular health
        concern or category of healing from a region or country in Africa (6-8 pages double spaced, 12
        point font with 1 ½” margins). Research Papers are due at 5 pm on Canvas Tuesday
        November 26. Late submissions will result in -10 points/day.
Quality of the research paper (40 points total) will depend on:
     •  Creative use of available sources, both primary and secondary (10 points)
     •  Attention to course themes (10 points)
     •  Historical accuracy (10 points)
