CLASS: TUESDAY AND THURSDAY 2-3:30PM
CLASS LAB HOURS: 5 HOURS PER WEEK
TEXAS PERFORMING ARTS SCENIC ART STUDIO PAC 2.206
HOURS Monday-Friday: 9:00am-12:00 noon, 1:00pm-5:00pm
Course Objectives:
The objective of this course is to introduce and practice the art of scene painting. The course is designed to
gain an understanding of the scenic artist’s roll in the entertainment industry and to develop manual skills
in drawing, painting, research, surface treatments and scenic finishes. This course will be practice based
and its assignments will be directly tied into the production schedule of Texas Performing Arts, Department
of Theatre & Dance, Butler School of Music, and the Texas Applied Arts Escape Room project. Due to
flexible production schedules, this syllabus is to be considered a general framework which may be
modified to fit production needs.
Course Description and Format:
The class will encompass 8 hours per week. We will meet in the PAC shop for 3 hours per week as a class.
I will lecture and demonstrate scenic painting techniques during this time. 5 hours per week will be set
aside as lab time for the course. Of these 5 hours, 3 hours will be dedicated to working on individual
assigned painting projects. 2 hours will be dedicated to Theatre & Dance and Opera productions in the
scenic art studio. Your projects will introduce numerous painting techniques based on traditional methods
of scenic painting and direct observation. You will be required to track your lab and class time on weekly
time sheets. Each project will be introduced with a lecture/demonstration. Subsequent class periods are
intended for work in class on assigned projects. Come to class prepared to work and dressed appropriately.
Wear clothing that can be discarded after the course. The productions we will work on this semester
include Don Giovanni, Marcus and the Secret of Sweet, Hero Twins, Spring Awakening, and the Planet
Texas 2050 Escape Room project.
Scene Painting topics presented over the Fall Semester
Cartooning, scaling images, transferring drawings via grid, pounce, and projector, value studies,
perspective drawing, color mixing, scumbling, wet blending, stippling, spattering, dry brushing, color
gradations, 2-D painting techniques, tropme l’ oeil, aging, backdrop painting, wood glazing, fabric
rendering, and tool building. It will be a full semester.
Documenting your work - Portfolios
You will be required to photograph and document your work in class and on productions throughout the
semester. The production scenic elements that you work on are most accessible while in the paint shop.
You will be expected to present a portfolio of your scenic work (class projects and production work) at the
end of the semester as part of your final review. The images need to be presented thoughtfully and
accompanied by show titles, designers’ names, year, location and size if relevant. This portfolio can be
digital.


A sketchbook will be kept for recording notes, paint recipes, and weekly drawing assignments. The
weekly sketchbook drawing assignments will be reviewed each Tuesday at the top of class. Sketchbooks
will be turned in at the end of the semester for grading with your final project. Your sketchbook must be
brought to each class.
Class time is intended as a time to touch base, discuss/critique weekly sketchbook assignments, share
problems and solutions, present work to the class, and for instructor demonstrations. Students are
responsible for recording demonstration information in their sketchbooks and being accountable for the
project information at the time of demonstration. Questions are always welcome. Lab times will be set by
the student and instructor to fit into the production schedule. Class lab times are intended for individual
exploration of assigned projects, production lab times are intended for work on College of Fine Arts
productions. Timesheets for class/lab times will be kept up to date and recorded daily.
Grading:                                                           % of Final Grade

(Buddha 10, Sight Size 10, Hollywood Backdrop 10, CERP Research 5, CERP Samples 5)

End of semester portfolio………………………………. 10
Students will be evaluated on the basis of class participation, preparedness and focus during in-class
workdays, attendance, weekly drawing assignments, and the final individual projects/portfolios. The
following grading scale will be used:
A = 100-90;          B = 89-80;        C = 79-70;          D = 69-60;      F = 59 or lower
Please clean during and after up all projects. Respect our tools and materials.
Failing to do so will result in the loss of a full project grade.
ATTENDANCE:
Grades will be lowered for absenteeism. All course information is given during the class periods. Plan to
attend all classes. Department regulations allow each student 2 unexcused absences. Unexcused absences
in excess of 2 will result in a lowered grade. If work time is missed, you are expected to make up your time
in the scenic art studio. Any adjustment of schedules must be made one week in advance, in writing and
agreed to by professor.
•Tardiness will also be heavily penalized. 2 “tardies” = one absence.
•Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. Sections 51.911 and
51.925 of the Texas Education Code address absences by students and instructors for observance of
religious holy days.
•Section 51.911 states that a student shall be excused from attending classes or other required activities,
including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A
student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be
allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a
reasonable time after the absence. University policy requires students to notify each of their instructors as
far in advance of the absence as possible so that arrangements can be made.
•Section 51.925 prohibits the university from discriminating against or penalizing an instructor who is
absent from class for the observance of a religious holy day. Proper notice must be given to the department
chair. Prior to the beginning of classes each semester, the instructor must provide the department chair a
list of classes that will be missed due to observance of a religious holy day. The list must be personally
delivered, acknowledged and dated by the chair, or sent certified mail, return receipt requested. Consistent
with regular University policy, the instructor is responsible for finding a qualified substitute UT Austin
instructor for any missed class(es).
