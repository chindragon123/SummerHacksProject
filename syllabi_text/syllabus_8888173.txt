COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This seminar will examine the relaOonship of design relaOve to the narraOves of race, gender, and diversity. The course
will be organized in related yet disOnct topical areas engaging in a criOcal discourse on ethnicity, race, gender and
sexuality within a mulO-disciplinary exploraOon of design and design issues. The seminar will leverage a growing
understanding and comprehension into shared points of examinaOon and discussion as we look to seek out and
discover a contemporary framing of this complex, criOcal, and someOmes personal conversaOon.
COURSE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:

          race, gender, and equity in the built environment
          ….have developed and honed the skills and capaci^es for a thoughaul and cri^cal discussion and discourse of
          these same oben complex and intense points of departure

CULTURAL DIVERSITY FLAG:
This course carries the ﬂag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a
substanOal porOon of your grade to come from assignments covering the pracOces, beliefs, and histories of at least one
U.S. cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalizaOon.
SEMINAR FORMAT AND PROCEDURES:
As a seminar, the interacOon will be circular and not linear. ParOcipants will be required to acOvely engage in the
seminar discussion and to bring to bear a though^ul dialogue in regards to the topics presented (for example, Assn.
type 1). A variety of diverse and compelling essays and mixed media prompts will be posted online weekly for the
seminar to consider in advance of the Monday seminar meeOng.
A`er the Monday seminar discussion, each parOcipant is expected to contribute to an ongoing journal/archive/seminar
blog of their seminar experiences and reﬂecOons. (for example, Assn. type 2)
Individual parOcipants will, on a rotaOonal basis, take turns uploading responses (for example, Assn. type 3) to the
prompt that will provide a point of departure for the seminar discussion to come. (Note: in the laber half of the
semester parOcipants potenOally might upload both prompts and responses) The engagements will be individual, in
small groups within the body of the seminar, and within the seminar as a assemblage of voices.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS:
Required Materials and Devices
Access to web-based/online materials (via CANVAS and other means) for uploading and downloading purpose will be
required for this course. Note taking and transcrip^on as a means of archiving individual seminar engagement is also
expected.
Classroom Expecta^ons (Assn. type 1):
Adendance is expected at all course mee^ng ^mes and will be recorded. Ac^ve par^cipa^on during the seminar is
par^cularly cri^cal as the discussion and interac^on is primary to the nature of the seminar typology.
Please contact the instructor prior to class if you expect to be late or to miss class and to ascertain if the absence will be
viewed as unexcused. A student who misses classes or other required ac^vi^es for the observance of a religious holy day
should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to
complete an assignment within a reasonable ^me aber the absence. A student who fails to complete missed work
within the ^me allowed will be subject to the normal academic penal^es.
The expecta-ons for the seminar par-cipa-on and discussion are that all viewpoints are inherently valuable and to
be respected in this academic se9ng. Respect for the mul-plicity of viewpoints and points of discussion is an
absolute.
