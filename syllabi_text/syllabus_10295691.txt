Topic Title: Bollywood: Shaker, Maker or Breaker of Society?
FLAG: This course carries the Global Cultures Flag.
Course Description: This course explores the dual role of Bollywood in society, viz., that as an
agent of social change on the one hand, and as a mirror of social reality on the other. By
examining the representations of South Asian society in Bollywood over the years, as well as the
influence of Bollywood cinema on society at various points in South Asian history, this course
begs us to critically reevaluate the role of cinema and popular culture as mere entertainment in
society.
Topics explored will include the relationship between Hindi cinema and the concept of “nation”;
notions and representations of “self” and “other”Hindi cinema and representations, roles and
perceptions of gender; Hindi cinema and the diaspora; notions of tradition and modernity;
centers and margins of society; the role of caste, religion and class in shaping HIndi cinema and
vice-versa.
Students who have had no prior experience with South Asian literature and cinema will get an
exposure to a new world-view. Students who have already been exposed to South Asian literature
and cinema will find and articulate new ways of approaching and interpreting the material.


Course Materials:
All assignments, including names of films to be viewed, as well as reading materials will be
available on the course CANVAS site (https://utexas.instructure.com/).
Films are an integral part of the course. All students are expected to see the assigned film
before the class period when it will be discussed.
One copy of each film shall be available on reserve at the PCL and Fine Arts libraries. Please be
considerate of other class-students if you checkout the films from the library, in that please return
them as soon as you have finished viewing it. Students may watch the film on their own or in
groups. If you so desire, you may also use the CANVAS announcement page to post inform
others of when you will be viewing the film, so that they may join you.
Many of the films are also available online for purchase at a nominal fee through various sites
like NETFLIX, YOUTUBE, AMAZON VIDEO, etc.
Please be aware that the contents of some of the films may be disturbing to some students.
Organization of the Course:
Students will take turns in leading classroom discussions on the assigned readings. Each
student shall be responsible to lead at least one classroom discussion on at least two of the
assigned texts and all assigned audio-visual materials being discussed that week. The
schedule for leading the classroom discussion shall be posted on CANVAS.
All students are expected to complete the reading assignments and view all assigned audio-
visual materials before coming to class, and to actively participate in classroom discussions.
Classroom participation will weigh heavily on the final grade. Classes and classroom discussions
will all be conducted in English. All films are subtitled in English.
Assignments:
Written:
(i) Weekly BLOGs: Students will be required to contribute to weekly BLOG posts at the course
CANVAS site at least once a week as follows: a minimum of 7 original BLOG posts over the
course of the semester, and comments on at least one BLOG each week. For an original
BLOG post to be counted towards credit in a particular week it must be posted by 11am
Wednesday of that week. Only one original BLOG per week per student shall be counted.
Additionally, each week only the first 10 original BLOG posts shall be counted towards “the 7
original BLOG credit”. So please be mindful and do not plan to do all original BLOG posts at
the end of semester -- it just won’t work. Besides, your BLOGs can be used to bounce off
ideas for your first essay and help you formulate your thesis for the same. So the early you
start posting original BLOGs, the better off you are as it will then feed into your first essay.


BLOGs should be around 200-300 words long and comments should be around 50-100 words -
however, quality is more important than quantity, so I would not worry too much about exact
word count as long as the BLOG and comment are well thought out and substantial.
Original BLOGs should be reflective commentaries on the film and readings being discussed
the upcoming week. They can and will naturally build on previous BLOGs and class discussions
from previous weeks but you must tie them in with the upcoming week’s film and readings.
BLOG posts and comments on BLOGs can include statements, questions, critique of the film
and/or readings in the case of an original post, and the BLOG itself in the case of a comment,
specifics quotes from the readings that raise interesting points, agreements/disagreements with
points made/raised in the readings and/or BLOGs as supported or disproved by the film, etc.
(ii) One review/critique of materials related to the discussion the student leads [see (i) of “Oral
Presentation” below]. The review should be around 500-1000 words long.
(iii) Two essays over the course of the semester. Each essay should be around 2500-3500 words
long, typed and double spaced.
         (a) 1st essay: The aim of the first paper is for students to develop their own thesis and to
argue for it with evidence from the course readings, films, class discussion and/or media articles.
Students will be required to support their arguments by drawing on at least four of the course
readings and two films. They will be required to include a bibliography at the end of the paper.
         (b) 2nd essay: For the second paper students will be required to choose at least one film
of their choice that we have not viewed or discussed in class, and critically examine the
role of that film in shaping social consciousness and vice-versa. Students will be required
to give a historical context and support their arguments by drawing on at least four
written sources. Students can also include additional written and/or multimedia sources if
desired. At least two of the four written sources have to be from class readings done over
the semester.
Oral presentation:
(i) Each student will be required to lead a classroom discussion at least once during the course of
    the semester. Guidelines shall be discussed in class. Students will submit a 500-1000 word
    review/critique of materials related to the discussion they lead. For the discussions students
    will be required to have a teaching plan ready and prepare "thought questions" to elicit
    discussion on the readings and film.
(ii) At the end of the semester, students will be required to give a brief in-class presentation of
their 2nd paper mentioned above.

Note: All assignments must be turned in on time for full credit.
Also, although attendance per se is not used to determine the grade, please be mindful that class
participation is not possible without attending the class. Active participation includes
meaningful participation.

Department of Asian Studies:

Class Policy on Inclusivity: This class welcomes and respects students of all backgrounds,
identities, and abilities. Professional courtesy and sensitivity to one another, and polite,
respectful discourse when view points differ, are core values in this class.
If you have a preferred name other than the legal name provided on the class roster and/or have a
preferred gender pronoun you use (she/he/they/ze, etc), please advise me of the same early in the
semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.


Class Etiquette: Please do not amble into and out of class during the class period. Please arrive
on time. If you are unavoidably late, as a courtesy to the class, please enter quietly so as not to
interfere with the concentration of other students. Please limit the use of your computer and
cell phones only to pull up texts/materials we are working on at that point of time in class.
Please do not send messages, emails, engage in social media, etc. when in class — doing so will
affect your class participation grade adversely. Use of cell phones and computers are not allowed
during quizzes and exams. Please do not work on your Hindi homework and/or on assignments
from other classes during class.
Remember, polite, respectful discourse when view points differ, are core values in this class.
Senate Bill 212 and Title IX Reporting Requirements: Under Senate Bill 212 (SB 212), the
professor, and TAs if any, for this course are required to report for further investigation any
information concerning incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, and
stalking committed by or against a UT student or employee. Federal law and university policy
also requires reporting incidents of sex- and gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct
(collectively known as Title IX incidents). This means we cannot keep confidential
information about any such incidents that you share with us. If you need to talk with
someone who can maintain confidentiality, please contact University Health Services
(512-471-4955 or 512-475-6877) or the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center
(512-471-3515 or 512-471-2255). We strongly urge you make use of these services for any
needed support and that you report any Title IX incidents to the Title IX Office.
Class Activities & Campus Carry law: Please note that from time to time some of the in-class
activities and exercises will require course participants to move about the room, go to the front of
the room and/or participate in a presentation. Please be mindful of the Campus Carry law and
University policies regarding the same. University policy and the implementation of the law
would be violated by the separation of the gun owner from their weapon that may result from
these required classroom activities. Please plan accordingly as no storage place is available in the
classrooms.
Disability Accommodations: Documented Disability Statement: Students with disabilities may
request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community
Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice), 232-2937 (video
phone) or http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd)
