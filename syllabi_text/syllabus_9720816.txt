COURSE OBJECTIVES
This seminar focuses on experimental research in financial accounting, managerial accounting and auditing. By
the end of the course, you should be better able to answer the following questions:
    •    What makes a good research question, at both a conceptual and operational level?
    •    What does “validity” mean in research? How is it established?
    •    What is the difference between a “main effect” and an “interaction”?
    •    How does one decide whether a research question is important?
    •    What are some key ethical issues in accounting research?
    •    What accounting issues are currently being addressed using experimental methods?
    •    What theories have accounting researchers drawn on to address these issues?
    •    When is experimentation an appropriate method to address an accounting research question?
    •    What can experimental design teach us about research using other methods?
    •    How has experimental accounting research influenced accounting policy making and practice?
    •    What are the greatest opportunities for future experimental research in accounting?

1. Pre-class summaries (15%)
Please complete a pre-class summary for each research paper before class (do not prepare these for background
papers or other readings. A summary has two parts: “Libby Boxes” and “Kinney Three Paragraphs.” A template is
attached to the syllabus and also available for download on Canvas. Please use only the space provided (one
single-sided page for each part).
The purpose of these summaries is to help you identify the conceptual and operational research questions in
each article, the importance of these questions, and how they are addressed. I have also asked you propose a
possible extension that you can raise in class. Please note that you should work alone in preparing these pre-
class summaries.
I will use your summaries to guide our in-class discussion, so summaries should be submitted to me by 9am on
class days.
2. Participation in class (25%)
This component includes both in-class presentations (“advocate” or “critic”) and your general participation in
class.
In-class presentations
Beginning with Session 2, each session will include one or more background papers and several (usually three)
research papers from the experimental literature in accounting. Although we will not cover the background
papers in detail, please do read the background papers and bring any questions that you have about the
background papers to class. For each research paper, one student will present the article as an advocate and
one will present it as a critic.
Advocate: The advocate should do more than just summarize the article, as we should all have read and
summarized it beforehand. That said, the advocate should start by summarizing the Libby Boxes for the article.
In addition, the advocate should highlight the study’s contribution and why that contribution is important. Take
the authors’ position and make the best possible case for the paper’s contribution.
Critic: The critic should point out the paper’s limitations, including limitations to the study’s incremental
contribution and any validity threats. In developing these points, keep in mind that the goal is to provide
constructive criticism, not merely to find fault. A constructive critic should suggest potential ways to address the
concerns raised.
Outlines: All presenters (advocates and critics) should prepare an outline of for class distribution. These can be in
any format you like (commonly bullet points or PowerPoint slides), but should be brief and to the point. Please
bring enough hard copies for each seminar participant, plus a couple of extras for visitors.
Advice: Embrace your role. This approach only works when we see spirited views on both sides. Have fun and
make your presentations interesting. If successful, the advocate and critic in combination should lead us to a
balanced discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each assigned article.
                                                                                                                    2


General Participation
This seminar succeeds with your active participation. I expect everyone to participate in the discussion of each
article, whether or not you are assigned to present that article as its advocate or critic. Challenge the advocate
and critic, making them defend their positions.
3. Critique (10%), DUE DATE
For this exercise, I will post a working paper (the same paper for everyone) and a detailed assignment with
specific questions to answer in your critique. There is no specific length requirement, but I would expect good
critiques to be 2,000-3,000 words. This will be good practice for the final exam for this class and the
comprehensive exam that you will take at the end of your second year in the program.
See “What is the difference between a critique and a review?” below for more on this exercise.
4. Review (10%), DUE DATE
This exercise is designed to give you some practice with the editorial review process. First, read the two articles
below (available on Canvas) for some guidance on doing a constructive review:
Oler, D. K., and W. R. Pasewark. 2016. How to review a paper. Issues in Accounting Education 31(2): 219-234.
Kachelmeier, S. J. 2004. Reviewing the review process. Journal of the American Taxation Association
          2(Supplement): 143-154.
I will also post a couple of journal reviews that I have written as examples on Canvas.
After you read this background, find an accounting research working paper (using experimental methods) at
www.ssrn.com. Use keywords to find a paper that looks like it would be of interest to you. Then download and
read the paper you pick.
Your assignment is to write a review as if you were assigned to do so by an editor at a top accounting journal. As
your pretend editor, I will not have read the paper beforehand, so your review must both summarize and
evaluate the manuscript. You must submit the manuscript along with your review.
What is the difference between a critique and a review?
The main distinction between the critique and review exercises for this class is that the critique should be more
detailed and comprehensive than a review.
The critique exercise is structured around specific questions related to (a) the independent and dependent
variables at a conceptual and operational level (i.e., the Libby Boxes), (b) the paper’s motivation, (c) the theory
and hypotheses, (d) the experiment’s design and data analyses, and (e) suggestions for improving the paper.
This structure is designed to let you “show what you know,” and is therefore good practice for the final exam in
this class and for the comprehensive exam. The closest real-world analog to a critique is probably a conference
discussion (which are sometimes published for journal conferences), although the format for such discussions
varies quite widely.
                                                                                                                    3


A review, on the other hand, is designed to help a journal editor or program coordinator for a conference decide
whether to accept, reject or request a revision of a submitted paper. Therefore, a typical review includes a short
summary of the paper’s research question and results, but does not do a comprehensive analysis of the
construct and operational level variables or discuss the research design in detail. Instead, most (good) reviews
provide a short summary and overall evaluation of the paper, and then focus on specific concerns regarding
motivation, contribution and/or validity, and how (or whether) those concerns can be addressed.
5. Research proposal and presentation (20%), DUE DATE
In addition to the objective of familiarizing you with the recent literature, there is also a forward-looking
objective to this seminar, encouraging you to contemplate research needs and opportunities for the future. To
achieve this objective, each student will submit an experimental research proposal. In approximately 4,000-
5,000 words, your proposal should contain the following.
•    Statement and motivation of the research question
•    Theory
•    Hypotheses
•    Experimental design
•    Plan of analysis
The key to a successful proposal is precision. Help the reader to see clearly what research question you are
addressing, why that question is important to accounting, what hypotheses you predict and why, and how
exactly you propose to carry out the experiment. Essentially, the requirement is to write the front end of a
manuscript on an accounting experiment, without actually conducting the research. I am available for
consultation as needed.
In addition to the written proposal, each student will present his or her research proposal to the class during the
last class session. The format will be ten minutes for an uninterrupted presentation, followed by ten minutes of
questioning from the audience. This will be great practice for presenting your research at conferences.
6. Final exam (20%) DATE
A final examination will reinforce the major points emphasized in this seminar. I will offer some guidance for
preparation as the date approaches.

                                               Kinney Three Paragraphs
    1) What is the research question? If you think the authors state a different research question than what they
       are actually answering, then you should say that.
    2) Why is it important? This should be YOUR evaluation, not just reiterating what the authors say. Does the
       paper contribute something that they don’t mention? How does the paper fit in with what’s been done
       before?
    3) How is the research question addressed? Describe (briefly) the critical design choices.
