Course Description.
The importance of brand storytelling continues to grow with new modes of message sharing. As more brands
move to a story/content marketing approach, this class shows students how to create tomorrow’s engaging,
sharable content. The course examines how classic elements of storytelling, semiotics, and symbolism can
be used to create and manage a modern brand’s story and “meaning.” Students will create visual, verbal, and
video examples of brand storytelling that go beyond traditional advertising and PR.
Course Outcomes.

By the end of this course, you should demonstrate an understanding of:
       Integrated Branding: How to analyze, construct, and manage meaning for brands in all media
       Storytelling: Ability to use various timeless aspects of story to create brand messages.
       Craft: How well a message is conceptualized, designed, and constructed.
Coursework.
You'll be assigned various projects to learn the theoretical fundamentals as well as practical skills of creating
modern brand messages. Each course section includes small projects, quizzes, and a capstone Major Project
to demonstrate both your theoretical and hands-on skills. Minor Daily Projects are simple tasks that can often
be completed during class, and include posts, quizzes, and small projects that are graded on a simple 3-point
scale. Major projects allow you more freedom to demonstrate your growing skills, carry more grade weight,
and are graded more subjectively. (In other words, your creative decisions play a bigger role in this grade, and
sheer amount of work put into a project does not always correlate with the final output. This is ultimately a
solution-oriented class, and there aren't always clear "right or wrong" answers--only better or weaker
solutions.)
Grades.
Here’s how your final course grade will be calculated:
40% = 2 Major Projects (20% each; graded)
60% = 23 Daily Projects (most class days; 3% each; lowest 3 grades dropped)
Final letter grades are calculated according to these cutoffs—no exceptions:
A = 94 to 100 A- = 90 to <94 B+ = 87 to <90 B = 87 to <84 B- = 84 to <80 C+ = 80 to <77 C = 77 to <74
 C- = 74 to <70 D+ = 70 to <67 D = 67 to <64 D- = 64 to <61 F = 61 to 0
Policies:
Late Work
As a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry, you are expected to complete every project on time –
no exceptions. All projects are due on Canvas at the date and time indicated on the Class Calendar.
Emergencies happen, so you are allowed one “Late Pass” without penalty, which gives you an additional 2
days (48 hours) to complete a single Major Project. Thereafter, you will not be able to turn in any late projects
under any circumstances, unless you already have a prior exemption for a Religious Holy Day, a school-
sponsored trip, or a doctor's note, obituary, or other serious issue that you can document with a written
excuse.
