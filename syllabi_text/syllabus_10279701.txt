COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course is a lecture / lab course designed to introduce students to Previsualization
workflows. The primary focus is to explore core technologies and practices utilized for the creation
of 3D environments for live entertainment. Software covered includes VectorWorks, LightConverse
and Hog PC. Student activities include: designing and drafting an original venue for live performance,
importing this environment into visualization software, and enhancing the user experience for
presentation.
LEARNING OUTCOMES:
By the end of the semester, students should be able to:
• create and implement original design ideas;
• apply common drafting practices utilized for live entertainment;
• effectively draft in both 2D and 3D;
• critically examine presentation techniques
COURSE MATERIALS:
    •   External hard drive
    •   Pencil
    •   1 – notebook (small or medium in size, easily accessible for note taking)
COURSE PROJECTS:
•   Project 1 (25%): 2D Drafting - Groundplan
•   Project 2 (25%): 3D Drafting - Model
•   Project 3 (10%): 3D Drafting - Textures
•   Project 4 (15%): Enhanced Previsualization - Lightconverse
•   Project 5 (25%): Client Pitch – Presentation
•   This course DOES NOT have a final exam
If you submit your assignment late it will not be reviewed in class.
All work is due as specified in the assignment listed in canvas. Work not completed prior to the
canvas deadline will be considered late.
Any work turned in late, regardless of the excuse, will result in a grade reduction of one full letter for
each calendar date it is late (an A would become a B and so on).


AET 344D: 3D Previsualization for Live Entertainment / Smith                                 Spring 2020
In summary:
Every assignment has a due date and time.
I do accept work after the due date, however, assignments automatically lose one full letter
grade for every calendar date submitted late and they will not be reviewed in class.
Any work turned in more than 4 calendar days late will receive an automatic F. If you are having difficulty
completing your work on time, please speak to me privately prior to the deadline, so we may discuss a
possible arrangement.
                       All assignments will be graded within 7 days of submission date.
Grading Scheme
A- Represents outstanding participation in all course activities. All assigned work must be completed
on time and with a very high quality of demonstrated skill and technique. There is an evidence of
significant development across all dimensions of learning. The result at this level demonstrates activity
that goes significantly beyond the required course work in one or more areas.
B- Represents excellent participation in all course activities; all assigned work must be completed on
time with consistently high quality in course work. There is an evidence of marked development
across all dimensions of learning.
C- Represents good participation in all course activities; all assigned work completed, with generally
good quality in course work. There is evidence of some development across all dimensions of
learning.
D- Represents uneven participation in all course activities; some gaps in assigned work completed,
with inconsistent quality in course work. The evidence of development across all dimensions of
learning is unclear.
F- Represents minimal participation in all course activities; serious gaps in assigned work completed,
or very low quality in course work. Development evidence is not available.
Please Note: If you are concerned about your grade – check in with us regularly so that we can
determine where you’re at, and what might need to be done to correct any problems. Do not wait
until the end of the semester!
ATTENDANCE:
ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY - Being a professional requires a habit of discipline and rigor.
Professionals in the arts achieve at the highest level when they work with determination and
dedication to detail. Your attention to attendance and lecture information gathering is an important
element of establishing professional standards and practices. The course lectures and discussions will
involve a significant amount of information that will not be available in any other form (textbook,
handouts); therefore, regular attendance is necessary for successful completion of the class.
If you need to miss class for legitimate reasons it is your responsibility to contact me directly with this
information. Sending a message by way of another student of an impending absence does not
constitute a legitimate notification.
For each unexcused absence after your first three, your final grade will be lowered by one letter
grade. Seven unexcused absences constitute an automatic F in the class.
Please be on time for class. If you are more than 5 minutes late for class you will be counted as
tardy. Every two instances you are tardy will be counted as one time absent.

                 POLICIES OF THIS COURSE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the
date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-
drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only
allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information,

Students with a documented disability may request appropriate academic accommodations from the
Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-
6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/

UT Electronic Mail Notification Policy
Electronic mail (e-mail) is a mechanism for official University and instructor communication to
students. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay
current with University- and course-related communications, recognizing that certain
communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a
minimum, twice per week.
It is the responsibility of every student to keep the University and instructor informed of changes in
his or her official e-mail address (do so at
https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/bio/address_change.WBX). Consequently, e-mail returned to
the University with "User Unknown" is not an acceptable excuse for missed communication. Similarly,
undeliverable messages returned because of a full inbox or use of a spam filter will be considered
delivered without further action required of the University or instructor.
(see http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy)
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
       “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of
       the University and uphold academic integrity.”
This means that work you produce on assignments, tests and exams is all your own work, unless it is
assigned as group work. I will make it clear for each test, exam or assignment whether collaboration is
encouraged or not.
Always cite your sources. If you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in
previous class), you must make that clear otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to
academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course.
You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty Policy which can be found at the
following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php]
University Resources for Students
