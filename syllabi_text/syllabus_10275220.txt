Other readings are journal articles and industry publications that will be available via our course website on
Canvas. You will read roughly one book chapter per week plus additional journal articles as assigned.
Journal articles that relate to our student led discussions will be made available on Canvas one week ahead
of schedule (starts 2/18/2020).
Course Website and Technology Needs
Canvas Course Website
In this class, Canvas will be used primarily for posting class-related assignment worksheets and grading.
Please ensure that you have a valid email address connected with Canvas so that you have access to all
course materials and communication. It is your responsibility to check Canvas regularly
(http://canvas.utexas.edu). The course schedule is available on Canvas as well as other important modules,
readings, and content – please make sure to check the site before class.
SPSS Software
We will use SPSS software in this class to complete several training modules and data analysis
assignments. Please make sure that you have SPSS installed on your laptop before the third class day. You
will also use SPSS to analyze data associated with your research project. This software is available with
student pricing through the UT Campus Computer Store (http://campuscomputer.com/campuscomputer/).
Classroom Expectations
Respect your fellow classmates
In this course, we will have in-class discussions every week. Opinions are welcomed; however, it is
important to remember that others might not hold your same viewpoint. Discussions and healthy debates
are an important part of the educational process. Please remember to respect your classmates and your
professor in all classroom discussions. If you are in violation of this policy, you may be asked to leave the
classroom. If you are asked to leave for behavioral violations, you will be counted as absent for the day.
Know your industry
Students should read academic journals, industry press, blogs, newsletters, or other periodicals that are
relevant to the class discussion and provide thought-provoking content for class each week. Advertising
research and media are quickly evolving fields, and it is crucial to stay on top of new developments both in
your area of interest as well as more broadly.
Take full advantage of every opportunity
The University of Texas at Austin and the Moody College of Communication provides many wonderful
resources to students. You should take advantage of every guest speaker, workshop, meeting, etc. that is
made available to you. So often these connections and lessons can help land you an internship or a job.
Each student will be required to attend at least 2 research presentations during the semester and provide a
brief written synopsis with a specific focus on the research methods used by the presenter (more details on
this below).
Course Requirements and Assessment
Research Paper - 35%
Research Paper Presentation - 20%
Experiential Learning-Based Methods Reports – 20% (2 @ 10% each)
Class Participation / Discussion Leadership – 25%
Research Paper and Presentation
Throughout the semester, you will develop or continue an original research paper with the primary focus on
the methods and discussion section. You will present your paper during the last two weeks of class
(4/28/2020 or 5/5/2020). Papers should follow the Journal of Advertising citation style and be no longer
than 30 pages (including references and appendices). Presentations will be 20 minutes each followed by 10
minutes of Q&A.
                                                                                                             2


Experiential Learning-Based Methods Reports
It is important to go and listen to research talks both as you start your academic career and as you work
through getting tenure and future promotions – they can be very impactful for your career. These include
seminar speakers and other formal research presentations (e.g. job talks, keynote speakers, guests from
industry with a research focus). I will invite you to many of these talks this semester and also encourage
you to keep up with them on the departmental listserv. You must attend at least 2 of these research talks,
and write a one-page overview of it with a main focus on the method employed in the research. Due dates
are 3/10/2020 and 4/21/2020.
Class Participation and Discussion Leadership
Class participation is rooted in attendance – it is vitally important to come to class prepared so that you can
be engaged and actively participate in the discussion. This grade is based on your discussion leadership
session as well as your overall participation in class throughout the semester. This is a subjective grade that
includes perceived effort, improvement, attitude, willingness to learn, and overall course engagement.
General Assessment Guidelines
A = Student engages in all activities; interacts with class members during face-to-face by providing
constructive feedback; expresses individual thoughts and poses questions during each class session;
actively participates in each small group session; volunteers for class discussion; prepared and familiar with
course material when called upon; does not use technology (phones, tablets, laptops) inappropriately during
class.
B = Student sporadically fails to participate in-class discussion or on learning tasks. Student demonstrates
lack of preparedness during class by not actively participating with group members to accomplish tasks.
Student only occasionally volunteers for discussion, and comments/ questions are off-topic. Student uses
technology (cell phones/tablets) for activities unrelated to the course.
C = Student seldom volunteers to express ideas or shares thoughts during face-to face meetings. Student’s
responses to questions demonstrate vague familiarity with module readings. Student is passive during
group projects and needs reminders to stay on topic or to actively participate. Student frequently uses
technology (i.e. cell phone, tablets) inappropriately during class.
D and below = Student never volunteers, cannot answer direction questions related to the readings,
participates in less than a semester of online discussion activities, and does not participate in group work
during face-to-face sessions. Student is routinely using technology inappropriately in class (i.e. texting,
emailing, Facebook-ing, etc.). Lack of participation and preparedness, both online and face-to-face, is
routine throughout the semester.

Classroom Policies
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a
student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and
uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use
words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your
sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action,
including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty
and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Grading Policies
In this course, grades are not given. They are earned. Therefore, I do not give you a grade; rather, you earn
your grade. For each assignment, you will be provided with a detailed rubric of how you earned your final
score.
Policy on late work
Late Work will not be accepted. Exceptions will be made under extreme circumstances, if the student
discusses the issue with the instructor ahead of time, either in person or via e-mail/phone.
Policy on absences
Attendance is mandatory. In order to be successful in this course, it is imperative that you attend every
single class. You are allowed one free absence for whatever reason you choose. After that, all future
absences will result in deducted points from your class participation grade.
Course Communication
All emails should be written in a professional manner. I will do my best to respond to emails within 48
hours. Technology will be used in this course. Laptops, iPads, tablets, etc. are welcomed in this classroom.
HOWEVER, these items should only be used for classroom-related activities. Please silence all devices
before class begins. If you are playing on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, checking email, etc.
during class, you may be asked to leave. If you are asked to leave for this reason, you will lose classroom
participation points.

dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance,
and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless they
have added a “preferred name” with the Gender and Sexuality Center
(http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-resources/). I will gladly honor your
request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster, and by the
gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so
that I may make appropriate updates to my records.
University Resources for Students
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical
information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building
needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment
for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to
maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. Any student with a documented disability who requires
academic accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or
512-410-6644 (Video Phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized
accommodations. For more information, visit http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/.
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and
cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to
ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know
experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly
encourage you to seek support. http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html
The Sanger Learning Center
Did you know that more than one-third of UT undergraduate students use the Sanger Learning Center each
year to improve their academic performance? All students are welcome to take advantage of Sanger
Center’s classes and workshops, private learning specialist appointments, peer academic coaching, and
tutoring for more than 70 courses in 15 different subject areas. For more information, please
visit http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/slc or call 512-471-3614 (JES A332).
BeVocal
BeVocal is a university-wide initiative to promote the idea that individual Longhorns have the power to
prevent high-risk behavior and harm. At UT Austin all Longhorns have the power to intervene and reduce
harm. To learn more about BeVocal and how you can help to build a culture of care on campus, go to:
wellnessnetwork.utexas.edu/BeVocal.
Accommodation of Religious Holidays
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project
in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work
                                                                                                            5


within a reasonable time after the absence.
Ma
Important Safety Information
If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs or Professors, call BCAL
(the Behavior Concerns Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous. If something
doesn’t feel right – it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety
and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling
outside.
  • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember
       that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
  • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
       week of class.
  • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a
       building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of
       Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
  • Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found
       at: www.utexas.edu/emergency
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed
six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual harassment,
sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational
institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
            1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
            2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or
                 have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
            3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory
Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I
am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in
writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a
Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with
someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and resources, visit
titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
