COURSE OVERVIEW
This course is an introduction to American government and politics. While our main focus is on the
national level, additional attention is paid to the state and local governments of Texas. In some instances,
the American case is placed in a comparative context derived from the experience of other western
democratic nations. In other instances, we focus on changes over time within the American political
system to demonstrate how principles often change with context. At all times, we are interested in a better
understanding of how this particular system has developed and what it means for citizens of the United
States.
There are three primary objectives in this course. The first is to provide basic descriptive information
about the American and Texas political systems by examining important political processes, institutions,
and actors. The second is to develop analytical skills with which to understand complex relationships and
phenomena. The third is to introduce the work of the political scientist by concentrating on the paradigms
and techniques of the discipline.
                                                                                                             1


The course is delivered completely online, which gives students more latitude in completing their
work, though the class is NOT entirely self-paced. The course meets online through Canvas. The course
material is organized by topic (“Modules”), and each module includes reading assignments, lecture and
guest-speaker videos, a segment keyed to recent events in politics, and a variety of assignments. Students
will be expected to complete about 3 modules per week. The course schedule below contains module
assignments and due dates.
This design allows students to complete the work within one week according to their own schedule – as
long as the due dates for completion of each module lesson are met. Students are encouraged to visit
http://www.laits.utexas.edu/tower/tech.html to test their computer and network connection.
NOTE: It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a secure and reliable internet connection and are
using a device that can access the course lectures, materials, and exams (technical requirements are
spelled out below).
ONLINE EXAMS
This course will have three, non-cumulative midterm exams. The exams will be open note, multiple choice
and will be administered online, in Canvas. See below for more details with respect to timing, format, and
content.
COURSE COMMUNICATION and INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT
    •   Announcements: Outside of the video lectures, any student communication initiated by instructors
        and teaching assistants will be conducted via the Announcements page on our course website, so
        please make sure to check the Announcements page daily.
    •   Outside-of-Class Communication: Students who wish to contact anyone on the teaching team
        (instructors or teaching assistants) can do so either through office hours or via the common

Information and data security
All exercises, quizzes, writing assignments, and online interactions over the TOWER system will be saved
and stored. All information will be kept for educational and general academic research. Any research or
data sharing with other researchers will involve de-identifying the data, including the removal of names,
UT EIDs, email addresses, or other information. To further ensure that your information is secure, please
do not include identifying information in your online interactions with others.
Also, remember that all information is stored on secure UT-Austin computer servers. In online
interactions with others, remember that the instructors and TAs will have access to all information.
ASSIGNMENTS and COURSE EVALUATION
The assignments and their sequencing are designed to actively engage students’ interaction with the on -
demand online format. There will be three (3) online exams. In addition to the exams, grades will be
derived from short answer assignments aimed at reinforcing students’ knowledge base. The readings,
lectures, and short answer assignments are all designed to prepare you for the exams. There should be no
surprises and you should do well if you do the readings, watch the videos, take notes, complete all short
answer assignments, and pay attention to where you may need to allocate resources to studying.
The following groups of assignments will constitute the graded work of the course. Final grades will be
calculated based on the total number of points earned.
                                                                                                           3

Exams                            150          3 exams @ 50 points each
Total Points                     300
    •   Short Answer assignments (15) – 5 points each [50 points total]. The highest ten (10) grades
        will be counted. Students will complete fifteen (15) short answer assignments (one per module)
        that develop applied understanding of the material presented by asking you to synthesize the
        material and make connections between and among concepts presented in each module. You will
        be graded on organization, spelling, and proper grammar. Your grade will also depend on the
        accuracy, thoughtfulness, and the details you include to support your answer and demonstrate
        (i.e., provide evidence) that you have read, understood, and can apply the course material
        presented in each module. Short Answer assignments for each module must be submitted via
        Canvas (when uploading, please use .doc or .pdf file formats) by 5:00 pm CDT on the due date.
        No exceptions.
    •   “In the News" Exercises (5) – 10 points each [50 points total]. Students will complete five (5)
        short answer assignments that develop applied understanding of the material presented in weekly
        “In the News” segments. Students will receive an announcement when the “In the News” video and
        assignment are available in Canvas, with a link to the video. Students will have 3-4 days to
        complete the assignment once it has been published. The “In the News” module will be located
        separately, at the top of the modules page. The same grading guidelines apply as outlined in the
        Short Answer assignments above. Each assignment must be submitted via Canvas by 5:00 pm
        CDT on the due date. No exceptions.
    •   Webtext “Get the Gist” Questions (13) – 5 points each [maximum 50 points total]. The highest
        ten (10) grades will be counted. The webtext will offer study questions that students will be asked
        to complete as you read the text. Each chapter will be worth 5 points, with your top 10 chapter
        scores contributing to your point total for this element of the course. You must answer these “Get
        the Gist” questions correctly to receive credit. You may reset the answers to all the questions on a
        page if you answer any of them incorrectly, but you will only have 3 total attempts to answer each
        set of questions correctly. A numerical score based on the percentage of total questions answered
        correctly will constitute your Texas Politics reading grade. Each assignment must be submitted by
        5:00 pm CDT on the due date. No exceptions.
    •   Midterm Exams (3) - 50 points each [150 points total]. Midterm Exams will be non-cumulative.
        Each of these computer-graded exams contains multiple-choice questions that cover material from
        lecture, videos, and the Texas Politics textbook. They are designed to reinforce your
        understanding of the course material. Exams are 75 minutes and consist of 50 multiple choice
        questions. Exam One will cover the material from Modules 1-5; Exam Two will cover the material
        from Modules 6-10; Exam Three will cover the material from Modules 11-15. Each exam will be
        open note; however, students will not be able to access the course modules during the exam.
        The midterm exams will be administered online from 7:00 pm-8:15 pm CDT on the appointed
        dates. We will use the UT Tower tool to conduct the exams. Students can access the tool through
                                                                                                             4


         Canvas. No extra software or computing capacity is needed, but students need to make sure that
         they have access to a reliable wifi connection when they log in to take the exam.
         If you have a university-defined and approved excuse (e.g., a medical or personal emergency) that
         prevents you from taking the exam at the appointed time, please notify us immediately so we can
         consider an alternative arrangement.
The grading scale is as follows:
93%-100%             A                    77%-79.99%         C+               67%-69.99%       D+
90%-92.99%           A-                   73%-76.99%         C                63%-66.99%       D
87%-89.99%           B+                   70%-72.99%         C-               60%-62.99%       D-
83%-86.99%           B                                                        0%-59.99%        F
80%-82.99%           B-
These percentages will be used to determine how your point totals map into grades. For example, the A
range is often 300 points * 93%, which would be 279-300. The A- range would be 300 points * 90%, which
is 270-278.99.
We reserve the right to use a curve, which would take the top score in the course and “percentage” off of
that number to determine cut-points. For example, say the top score were 295. We might then take 93% of
this to set the A range at 274-300, the A- range at 265-273.99 (90% * 295), etc. We emphasize that
students should not EXPECT a curve; it is something that we occasionally use if we think it appropriate
given the overall distribution of scores.

TITLE IX REPORTING
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment,
sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational
institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
     1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
     2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
          become involved in a Title IX investigation.
     3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory
Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX
Coordinator. We are Responsible Employees and must report any Title IX related incidents that are
disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with us, or with any faculty or staff member
about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to
speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university,
email advocate@austin.utexas.edu. For more information about reporting options and resources,
visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
