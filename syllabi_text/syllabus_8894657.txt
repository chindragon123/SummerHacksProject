The Course: Disruption has dramatically redefined the delivery of content and the
financial models around it. This has created an abundance of opportunities for the
entrepreneur within traditional media and the budding start-up alike.
We will bring real-life experience/exposure for those who hope to enter this
important arena with a series of interviews with real-life practitioners from social
media, venture capital, and others with expertise in this important arena.
In addition, we will explore some important trends in digital content and the
business models they are creating. This is NOT a course focused on journalism but
rather a primer for those who wish to learn about entrepreneurialism, technology
and it’s intersection with media. We will also spend 3 weeks with online modules
regarding Entrepreneurship as we work thru case studies.
Taking a cue from Inside the Actors Studio, this weekly 3-hour class will include
guest speakers from a variety of disciplines. Professor Mark Bunting is the former
television host of many popular computer programs from CNBC, The Discovery
Channel and The Learning Channel, https://www.linkedin.com/in/markbunting/


As a serial entrepreneur in both technology and media, Mark will expose students to
a broad spectrum of speakers within the industry. Students will also have an
opportunity to meet each guest and “network” with these highly influential leaders.
Due to the fact that the speakers for this class are not yet confirmed, a tentative
schedule of speakers will be posted on blackboard by the 2nd week of class.

Students are allowed ONE excused and one unexcused absence for the semester
without penalty. If for some reason you are unable to attend class, the student is
expected to inform the TA assigned to the class via email prior to class. Being
absent for class may result in a reduction of your grade for the course. If a student
misses a class for any reason, it is the student’s responsibility to be informed of the
materials covered during the class. 2 class misses will likely prohibit a student from
achieving an A, 3 or more missed classes will automatically exclude ANY
student from achieving anything higher than a B. Class attendance is
mandatory.
Tests -35%
There will be a Final Exam. The exam will be completed on a laptop through Canvas
and will consist of true/false and/or multiple-choice questions and/or short answer
