Course Statement:
This course will survey the modern history of the Middle East, covering the transitional period of
the dissolution of empires and the emergence of nation-states in the early 19th century up until
the beginning of the 21st century. Focus will be on cultural, intellectual, economic, and military
encounters with the West in the 19th century and the emergence of political and cultural struggles
against colonialism which found expression in nationalist and Islamist narratives of history.
While major political events and state actors constitute the primary focus of the course, non-state
actors such as Armenians and Kurds will also figure as major players in determining the
trajectory of history in the region. Several major themes that tie the course together will include:
Western imperialist objectives and varied Middle Eastern responses, state-making efforts and the
genesis of nationalist movements in Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Egypt, Syria, and Kurdistan; the
emergence of a new class of reformers and intellectuals in the late nineteenth century; the
transformation of predominantly secular/communist nationalist politics to Islamist responses to
the perceived dominance of Western powers including the Soviet Union and the United States.
Starting with Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt and Russia’s conquest of the Caucasus, events that
many have identified as the forceful introduction of modernity into the Middle East, through the
colonial era, to the nationalist period of the 1950s and the 60s, and the rise of Islamism in the
1970s and beyond, students will develop a rich understanding of the volatile and dynamic
Middle Eastern politics over the last two centuries.

and post them on canvas before start of class. Additional readings will include short primary
sources, documents, and speeches that will be posted on Canvas.
There will be two exams, a midterm and a take-home final, that assess student’s comprehension
and ability to communicate the primary themes developed and discussed the textbook and
lectures in class. Additionally, students will write a short essay or a book review (4-5 pages) of
one of the books under the sub-heading “Additional reading.”
Each exam and writing assignment will count equally in assigning a final grade. (All

Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. Since a heavy portion of your grade is based off of class lectures,
active participation and preparation for class discussions are required. Students needs to have
read the material and demonstrate it by their participation in class to qualify for a full grade.
Class usually will start with a pair or group discussion of the question you respond to on Canvas.
This will help us get started on framing the discussion for the day. Lack of active participation in
group discussions will negatively affect your participation grades. Having more than three
absences may result in a failing grade or an incomplete in this course.
Religious Holidays: In accordance with university policy, you need to notify me of your
pending absence three days prior to the anticipated date of observance of religious holidays. If
you must miss a class, an exam, or an assignment, due to religious observance, I will give you an
opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
University Honor Code
The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community. All work for this course will be that of the student and original contributions.
Aims and objectives:
This course provides students with the tools necessary to identify the legacies of the 19 th and
20th centuries that continue to affect the contemporary politics of the Middle East. The
discussions and readings in this class are geared towards tackling two primary questions that
inform our debate in class: What caused and determined the specific ways in which the Ottoman
and Iranian empires responded to economic and political penetration and domination of the West
and how did this affect the post-WWI politics? How different human geographies, economies,
and historical trajectories affected the implementation of such responses in different parts of the


Middle East. And secondly, what accounts for the differences and similarities of the historical
trajectories shaping the Middle Eastern countries and regions?
This course aims to offer some historical explanation to human experiences in non-Western
spaces. By studying Iranian, Turkish, Kurdish, and Arab Muslim and Christian responses to
Western encroachment in the late 19th and 20thcentury, students will be exposed to different
human experiences that provide insight into their perceptions of the world. Successful students
will be capable of making informed ethical decisions and better equipped to read and understand
daily news.
