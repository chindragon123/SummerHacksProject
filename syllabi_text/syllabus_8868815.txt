Dirks, Autobiography of an Archive: A Passage to India, Garcia and Castro,

Essays
Two essay papers are required (approximately 7 pages). Class readings and
course lectures must be integrated in the conceptualization of the essays. I will
provide topical questions.
Presentation
Students are required to give a presentation. There are 3 options.
1. Select your own reading. The presentation can be based on an article, book,
poetry, or music.
2. Present your analysis of an oral history interview or oral tradition research
project. Your presentation may be based on an oral history that you will conduct
for this course, or on current or past research (reflection). If you conduct an oral
history interview for this class, it cannot be used for your thesis or dissertation. If
you plan to use it for your thesis or dissertation you must have IRB approval.
      If you choose to present when an assigned essay is due, you may turn in
your paper the following week.
      3. An analysis of on-line web material.
Attendance and Discussion Participation
Attendance is required. Participating in discussion is also required. Excessive
absences or never participating in class discussion will lower your grade. Grade
breakdown (grade distribution is required by university): 40% each paper, 10%
presentation, and 10% class participation and attendance.
