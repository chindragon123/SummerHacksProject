persuasive pieces, using a variety of digital software tools. This course introduces all students to the
fundamentals of good graphic design, as well as production basics. Students will then build their digital design
skills using industry-standard software, from print (Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop) to motion (Adobe
Premiere) and interactive (HTML, CSS, Dreamweaver). Assumes no prior knowledge.
Course Outcomes:
 1. Adobe CC Skills: Ability to use various Adobe professional-level applications to create brand messages.
 2. Craft: How well a message is conceptualized, designed, and constructed digitally.
 3. Visual Communication: Understanding how we communicate visually, in static, motion, and interactive
     media.
Coursework.
You'll be assigned various projects to learn the theoretical fundamentals as well as practical skills of designing
and producing work using various Adobe CC programs. Each course section includes small projects, quizzes,
and a capstone Major Project to demonstrate both your theoretical and hands-on skills. Minor Daily Projects are
simple tasks that can often be completed during class, and include quizzes and small projects that are graded
pass-fail. Major projects allow you more freedom to demonstrate your growing design skills, carry more grade
weight, and are graded more subjectively.
Grades.
Here’s how your final course grade will be calculated:
60% = 4 Major Projects (15% each; graded)
40% = Daily Projects (most class days; quiz or complete/incomplete; lowest grades dropped)
Final letter grades are calculated according to these cutoffs—no exceptions:
A = 94 to 100 A- = 90 to <94 B+ = 87 to <90 B = 87 to <84 B- = 84 to <80 C+ = 80 to <77 C = 77 to <74
 C- = 74 to <70 D+ = 70 to <67 D = 67 to <64 D- = 64 to <61 F = 61 to 0
Policies:
Late Work
As a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry, you are expected to complete every module and
project on time – no exceptions. All projects are due on Canvas at the date and time indicated on the Class
Calendar.
Emergencies happen, so you are allowed one “Late Pass” without penalty, which gives you an additional 2
days (48 hours) to complete a single project. Thereafter, you will not be able to turn in any late projects under
any circumstances, unless you already have a prior exemption for a Religious Holy Day, a school-sponsored
trip, or a doctor's note, obituary, or other issue that you can document with a written excuse.
