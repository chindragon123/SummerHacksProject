AMS 310/HIS 315G is an introductory course in American Studies, a field that examines
American culture and society from multiple perspectives. Using a variety of sources and
methods, this course takes as its focal point American attitudes regarding place, landscape,
community, nature, and the physical environment as demonstrative of social values both
historic and current, dominant and resistant. This course examines a number of major
conceptual categories connecting the North American continent and the people who have
inhabited it, such as landscape and the physical environment, people and place, and community
and place-making, each of which demonstrates great transformations in American society,
culture, and everyday life, while also showing main currents and trajectories over time. The
interdisciplinary approach of this course draws upon history, geography, sociology, literature,
popular culture, and other methods of inquiry to reveal a history fraught with political and
social conflicts that complicate narratives of national consensus.
Class format: This is primarily a lecture course but I encourage questions and discussion.


Learning is collaborative!
Supplemental Instruction (SI): SI consists of optional discussion sections led by one of the
course TAs, Kate Grover. These sessions will help reinforce and clarify course content plus help
you to learn the material more effectively. SI also gives you a smaller forum for discussing
course content and getting to know your classmates. Regular participation in SI discussion,
although optional, has been shown to improve students’ performance by an average of one-
half to one full letter grade higher than the class mean.
Requirements: Regular attendance, completion of all reading and assignments, three exams.
Goals/outcomes: As members of this intellectual community, you will:
1. Gain a greater understanding of people, places, groups, events, and ideas throughout
American history how they have impacted American culture and society in their time and in
ours.
2. Engage with a variety of types of texts and evidence to become interdisciplinary interpreters
of American history.
3. Build critical thinking and analysis skills through written expression, including constructing
thesis statements and supporting your argument with evidence from lecture and readings.
Grading:
First exam                      20%     Mon Feb 25, in class
Place analysis (3 pgs)          10%     Wed Mar 13
Second exam                     30%     Mon Apr 8, in class
Final exam                      40%     Day, time, location TBA
Grading scale: A 93-100; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76; C- 70-72; D+
67-69; D 63-66; D- 60-62; F 0-59
Exam format: All exams will be closed book/notes. Exam I will consist of FIVE identification
questions (choice of 10) and Exam II will consist of ONE essay (choice of 2). There will be a
review session held before each exam. The final exam will contain SIX (6) IDs (choice of 15) and
ONE essay (choice of 2). The IDs on the final will be taken from the last third of the course but
the essay will require you to integrate and synthesize material from the entire semester to
construct your analysis. On all tests, you will be expected to write your essay answers with
supporting evidence from the assigned readings and lectures. For this reason, regular class
attendance is crucial in order to do well in the course. Do not rely on the inevitable Google doc
as a substitute for reading or attending lecture. I do not intend to post lecture slides to Canvas.
Make-up policy: Failure to take a scheduled exam without making prior arrangements with
the teaching assistant or me will result in an automatic zero for that exam. I will allow you to
take a make-up exam only in the event of a medical or family emergency, or if you have official,
documented University of Texas at Austin business outside of campus. In both cases, you must
notify your TA or me BEFORE the scheduled exam, unless extraordinary circumstances while
traveling to the exam dictate otherwise, in which case official documentation will still be
required. All make-up exams must be taken at 8 a.m. one week after the scheduled exam.
Post-exam protocol: If you would like the TA to review your exam after it has been graded,
please carefully review the comments and wait a minimum of 24 hours before contacting the
TA. Thereafter, make sure to address all questions about your grade within eight days after you
have received your exam back. If you do not reach an understanding with the TA, then I will be


happy to review your exam as well. Please keep your exams as they will help you as you review
for the final exam.
Required readings: Required texts will be in the course reader, available for purchase at Jenn’s
Copies (2518 Guadalupe St). I encourage each of you to be active readers and interact with the
texts by underlining, highlighting, and engaging with the texts as you see fit. Some readings are
available online via Canvas. Please show up to class ready to discuss the assigned texts.
Attendance: Students are expected to attend class regularly and to participate as best they can
in such a sizable class. While no record of attendance will be kept, being in class consistently
and doing the assigned reading are essential to satisfactory performance in the class.
Office hours: I encourage you to come to office hours during the semester so you can get the
most out of the course. This is an opportunity for you to discuss exam expectations, aspects of
the lecture material or readings, or just to say hello.
Devices: Laptops and tablets in class must remain silent and may not be used for any reason
other than course-related material (this should go without saying, but no phones are to be used
in class). I trust you to use technology responsibly, but failure to abide by this policy may result
in the revocation of in-class laptop/tablet privileges at my discretion.
Communication: Course-related announcements, relevant or interesting links, potential
changes to the course schedule, and other important information will be posted to the course
Canvas site (and therefore sent to you via email), so please check your email at least once per
day. All emails sent to me will be responded to within 24 hours of receipt unless unforeseen
circumstances arise.
Classroom conduct: This course is built upon discussing topics that are often controversial and
difficult. I encourage all of you to share your informed opinions, feeling, and experiences, and
to engage in conversations that invite productive and respectful disagreement. As such, we all
must maintain respect for the classroom environment and for our colleagues. Be willing to have
your own points of view challenged and be willing to respectfully challenge others. The most
productive and exciting intellectual growth emerges from engaging with diverse opinions.
Concealed handgun policy: Per official University of Texas policy, “It is the responsibility of
concealed-carry license holders to carry their handguns on or about their person at all times
while on campus. ‘About’ the person means that a license holder may carry a holstered
handgun in a backpack or handbag, but the backpack or handbag must be close enough that
the license holder can grasp it without materially changing position. The holster must
completely cover the trigger area and have enough tension to keep the gun in place if jostled. A
license holder may not carry a partially or wholly visible handgun on campus premises or on any
university driveway, street, sidewalk, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking area.” With
this in mind, consider that the simplest thing for conceal-carry license holders to do would be to
leave their handgun in a safe, secure location rather than bring it to class.
Flags: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity
courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American
cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come
from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one U.S. cultural
group that has experienced persistent marginalization. This course also fulfills the history core
curriculum requirement.
Students with disabilities: Any student with a documented disability who requires academic
accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259
(voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty members are not required to provide
accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.


Academic honesty: In an effort to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and integrity in the
classroom, cheating and plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. Cheating or plagiarism will
result in an automatic zero for the assignment and will be reported to the Dean of Students.
University policies regarding academic honesty are available at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php
TL;DR version: show up to class consistently, be respectful of each other, put phones away, use
laptops for class-related stuff only, don’t cheat on quizzes or exams.
