                                                                                              Spring 2019
   Description:        Major professional and amateur sports exist today as very large businesses.
                       The rights to broadcast games, matches, races and events are sold for
                       billions of dollars and the revenues they generate underpin the entire sports
                       ecosystem globally.
                       The course is designed to provide students with a basic understanding of how
                       the business of sports media operates both as a business generating revenue
                       and content and as a provider and disseminator of information and critique.
                       The course will be primarily lecture and discussion of key topics and issues
                       involved with the business of sports media with various guest speakers from
                       sports\media entities that have an impact in this area.
                       This course will examine the many facets of the business of sports related
                       media including over the air television, cable, satellite TV, print, radio, social
                       media and internet based, the business models that each of these types of
                       media use, the challenges to such models and the changes that are likely in
                       the future and the impact of such media on sports presentation and
                       development, professional franchises, colleges and conferences and the
                       consumer. It will trace the historical development of sports as social
                       phenomenon and the essential role that media has played in shaping and
                       building its role in domestic society and international relations.
   Objectives:         The student who successfully completes this course will ideally be able to:
       1. Understand the reasons for the growth of sports as key part of American society and
          culture, and the central role that media has played in that growth.
       2. Apply basic terminology and fundamental theories/principles of the sports and sports
          media industries.
       3. Understand the key parties, relationships and business models in the sports media
          ecosystem
       4. Identify and understand the key role that sports and the media has played in American
          society.
       5. Understand how sports and the media can shape political discussion and political
          behavior
       6. Develop your own theories on the use of sports and the media as a means for future
          social change and the implications of such power and ability by these institutions.
COURSE OUTLINE
Approach:
   This course will be comprised of fifteen (15) sessions plus exam week with each individual
   session being approximately three hours (3.0) in length. Due to the length of each class, the
   course will be designed to include a mixture of lecture by the principal instructor and guests,
   group discussion, periodic quizzes and other in-class challenges.


                                                                  THE BUSINESS OF SPORTS MEDIA
                                                                             ADV 348S, PR 348S, J 348G
                                                                      SYLLABUS & COURSE OUTLINE
                                                                                                Spring 2019
Class Preparation:
    1. It is expected that each student will be prepared to participate in lively, intelligent and
         professional discussion. This includes listening respectfully to all.
    2. Reading assignments and homework must be done prior to attending class so that
         everyone will benefit from an in-depth discussion of issues.
    3. All written assignments are to be typed. Spelling, grammar, and punctuation must be of
         professional or business standard. You must use a recognized citation standard when
         referencing the works of others in your written submissions.
    4. All cell phones and pagers will be turned off prior to class. Laptops are permitted but such
         privileges may be rescinded in the discretion of the instructor if laptops are used for other
         than class use.
Attendance:
    Students are expected to attend every class which is critical to the success of the course. As
    noted below, a large part of your grade will come from in class activities. Students are to be
    prepared to start the class session on time.
    If for some reason you are unable to attend class, the student is expected to inform the
    instructor via email prior to class.
    Being absent or late for class may result in a reduction of your grade for the course. If a
    student misses a class for any reason, it is the responsibility of the student to be informed of
    the materials covered during the class. Each student is encouraged to find a “class buddy”
    who can share information, handouts, and assignments.
Academic Integrity and Standards:
    Students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity in all
    course activities and assignments. It is expected that there shall be no deception regarding the
    representation made by the student of his/her preparation, participation, or performance.
    Plagiarism is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgement makes the difference. Plagiarism is
    presenting another person’s work as though it is one’s own. Plagiarism is the presentation of a
    sequence of words, from another writer, quoted without quotation marks and presented as one’s
    own work. It is crucial that acknowledgement of sources be accurate and complete. This
    includes citations of all sources on written assignments. The instructor uses various tools to
    determine if plagiarism has occurred.
    The remainder of the course requirements and policies relating to cheating and plagiarism are
    subject to the standard policies and procedures for all UT-Austin students as established by UT-
    Austin.

Feedback Statement (to encourage students to respond to your requests for their
feedback) and University Course Evaluations
During this course, I will be asking you to give me feedback on your learning in informal as well
as formal ways, including through anonymous surveys about how my teaching strategies are
helping or hindering your learning. It’s very important for me to know your reaction to what we’re
doing in class, so I encourage you to respond to these surveys (including completing university
course evaluations), ensuring that together we can create an environment effective for teaching

Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble
outside when a fire alarm is activated, or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the
following policies regarding evacuation:
     • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that
        the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
     • If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
     • In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the
UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office
Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic
reasons to six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:
            • “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education
                may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped
                courses, including any course a transfer student has dropped at another
                institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping
                more than that number.”

A. Periodic Written Assignments are due as assigned. The specifics of each assignment will be
discussed in class and\or on Canvas but will generally be focused on current issues\news involving
sports media as presented in the current issue of the Sports Business Journal. Each assignment may
require the student to consider outside sources to perform an analysis of the question presented. An
analysis is not a reiteration of the remarks by the author. An analysis is a concise, cogent reflection
clearly articulated and supported with examples, and connected to course-related theories.
Format:
    1. These analyses are to be up to but no more than 750 words, maximum, appropriately
         referenced. Any content over the maximum limit will not be reviewed and the assignment will
         be graded on the first 750 words only.
    2. Students must provide a word count in writing at the conclusion of each assignment.
    3. Each writing submitted for credit in this class will be judged not only on reasoning and content
         but on the quality of the writing style and grammar as well.
    4. Late assignments may be turned in after discussion with and receipt of the approval of the
         instructor or the Teaching Assistant but the maximum grade that may be received for a late
         assignment is one half the credits. All such writings shall be submitted through Canvas,
         pasted into Canvas, not attached
    5. Grades will generally be posted to Canvas within two weeks of assignment submission by
         students.
B. In Class Quizzes. We will have periodic (4-5) Quizzes in Class dealing with assigned
readings and SBJ weekly readings. Notice will not normally be given of such quizzes.
Additional details to be discussed in class.
C. Mid Term Exam. A Midterm exam shall be given between weeks 7 and 9. It will consist of a
number of some combination of multiple choice, true\false, short answer and similar type questions
and will cover material assigned and lectures given through the date of the exam.
D. The Final Take Home Question. Students will be asked to draw upon the various course
readings, SBJ articles and other material used or assigned and in class discussions and lectures to
express an understanding of a topic or topics involving the business of sports media. The final
assignment will be multiple questions, each with a maximum of 300 words, appropriately referenced.
The standards set out above for Periodic Written Assignments shall apply here as well.


                                                                  THE BUSINESS OF SPORTS MEDIA

E. Extra credit. Extra credit lectures or other extra credit opportunities may be available and will be
posted and\ or discussed in class.
    1. NOTE: You accumulate points over the course of the semester by completion of all of
         the above graded activities. Maximum points available equal 100 (plus any extra
         credit). If you miss any of the graded activities or fail to complete or submit them, the
         points associated with those activities are forfeited and as such, will impact your final
         grade.
    2. Class Participation & Overall Engagement: this is essential to highly effective
         learning. In appropriate cases, students may earn up to 2% (02 points).
    3. EXTRA CERDIT OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENTIRELY DISCRETIONARY; EXCESSIVE
         CLASS ABSENCES OR ANY INDICATION OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY WILL RESULT
         IN THE IMMEDIATE ZERO-ING OUT OF ALL POSSIBLE EXTRA CREDIT POINTS IN
         ADDITION TO ALL OTHER APPLICABLE PENALTIES.
F. Grading

         will be available by Monday, 28th January, 2019 at Jenn’s on Dean Keeton and
         Guadalupe.
    2. Students will also be expected to familiarize themselves with current relevant news and
         events regarding the business sports media as news breaks. As such, it is strongly
         recommended that students read the New York Times, Washington Post, and the Wall Street
         Journal on an active basis.


                                                                THE BUSINESS OF SPORTS MEDIA

    3. Further, The Sports Business Journal (SBJ) is a mandatory weekly read (starting in
        week 3) and is an invaluable source of current information. Details will be given about SBJ in
        class or in a posted Announcement in Canvas.
    4. We will begin using SBJ in the second week of class so you must subscribe or have SBJ
        available before your second class. Articles and material of current interest to a topic being
        discussed in class will be assigned periodically throughout the semester.
Course Plan
Important Note re: Class Prep/Readings:
We significantly reduce the amount of SYLLABUS LISTED course readings for the 2nd
half of the semester. Frankly, the industry is moving so fast and the topics are so
relevant and fast-evolving that we will be posting the readings closer to the semester
mid-way point. This may result in a second Coursepak, or a series of linked articles
(TBD).
We may also publish Links WEEKLY for the next class, so please check in regularly to
ensure you are up to date on course prep.
