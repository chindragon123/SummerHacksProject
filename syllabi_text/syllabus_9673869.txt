Text: “Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics,” Smith, Van Ness, and
Abbott, 6th or 7th editions,
        This course will closely follow the material in your textbook. Our goal is to
complete Chapters 2, 3, 5 & 6 plus material in Chapters 10-11. This is a lot of
information to absorb in a short period of time and it will require your full attention.
Spending the necessary time carefully reading each chapter and doing the assigned
homework problems will prepare you for taking the exams. My lectures will cover the
highlights in each chapter. As often as I can, I will give you a perspective that differs
from your text. I will also give you a molecular interpretation of various thermodynamic
quantities (e.g., temperature, internal energy and entropy) even though thermodynamics
is independent of any molecular model of matter.
Exams: There will be 3 exams each counting 1/3 of your grade. The exam problems
will be based on the assigned homework problems, example problems in the text, and
problems posed in class notes. The exams are scheduled for Monday, July 29, Monday,
Aug. 12, and the final exam on Saturday, Aug. 17. The final exam will be
comprehensive, but with an emphasis on the last 1/3 of the course material. Formula
sheets will be provided for all exams. You need only bring pencil and calculator. The
calculator must be without extended memory. If your calculator has extended memory,
you must completely clear memory before bringing it to an exam. This requirement will
be closely monitored.
Course notes: A set of course notes will be posted on Canvas. These notes supplement
the material covered in the text, but don’t ignore the material in the text.
