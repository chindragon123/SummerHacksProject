                                HISTORY OF THE RELIGIONS OF ASIA
                                              Spring 2019
                                              Joel Brereton
This course surveys the central beliefs and patterns of life of living religious traditions of Asia. It
will focus particularly on the basic texts or narratives of these traditions, on their classical
expressions and essential histories, and on the concepts of humanity, the world, and the divine
that are distinctive of each. In addition, the course will explore not only what people believe
religiously but also what they do religiously. Part of the course, therefore, will consider the ways
of life, forms of social action, and rituals practiced by different communities. Not all Asian
traditions can be included in a one-semester survey. The traditions chosen originated in Asia,
have large numbers of adherents, possess particular historical significance, and represent
different cultural areas. By the end of the course, students will have a understanding of the basic
histories and orientations of these religious traditions.
Written Assignments and Attendance:
Written assignments comprise three interpretive essays on primary texts assigned in the course,
two exams, and a final interpretive essay. The final essay is due at the time scheduled for the
final exam, Saturday, May 18, at 2pm.
The final grade for written work will be determined as follows:
      First exam (midterm)                                     20%
      Second exam (end of term)                                20%
      First essay                                              10%
      Second and Third essays, each                            15%
      Final essay                                              15%
      Attendance                                                5%
We allow up to three unexcused absences. Beyond that number, one point for each unexcused
absence may be deducted from the ten points for attendance. Vigorous and informed
participation in class discussions can help a grade, especially a marginal one, as can other
factors, such as a student’s progress or demonstrated effort in the course.
Computers, Tablets, Smartphones:
Please do not use computers, tablets, smart phones, or the like in class. I know this request
sounds downright Luddite, but these devices inhibit class discussion. I use presentation software
in class and I will post presentations after class.
Grading:


This class uses the standard UT grading scale of 94-100 A, 90-93 A-, 87-89 B+, 84-86 B, 80-83
B-, 77-79 C+, 74-76 C, 70-73 C-, etc. The lower number for each grade is the minimum mark for
that grade.

Academic Integrity:
Be careful not to copy the work of peers or to use material without proper attribution. Whether
you are quoting or paraphrasing, you need to indicate the source on which you draw. Nothing can
be more disastrous for your grade or for your college record than to be found to have violated the
University rules on academic honesty. Students who violate these rules are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course or dismissal from the University or
both. If you have any questions about properly utilizing sources, check with the TA or instructor.
Global Cultures Flag:
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. All the assignments in this course
will concern the practices, beliefs, and histories of Asian cultural groups, both past and present.
Certificate Program in Core Texts and Ideas:
This course counts towards the Certificate Program in Core Texts and Ideas, a six-course
sequence in the great books, ideas, and controversies. The program is open to students in all
majors and colleges. For more information, visit http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/coretexts/ or

According to UT policy, you must notify the instructor of your pending absence at least two
weeks prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you miss an examination or an

will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable period before or
after the absence.
