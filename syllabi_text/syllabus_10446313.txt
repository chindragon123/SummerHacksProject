 Please note that Canvas does not always take into account the proper grading policies and may ignore
 blanks in grade book caused by not turning in assignments, so you should not just blindly trust the final
 grade you see in Canvas. We recommend that you calculate your grade on your own using Excel and the
 details about points listed above in this syllabus. Simply add up the points you have received on graded
 assignments and extra credit then divide by 1375. It is your responsibility to know your grade and raise
 questions if you have any before end of the class. Any individual grade appeals must be made within a
 week of the grade being posted through the given appeal process. After the class ends no individual
 assignment grade appeals can be allowed.
 NOTE: Rounding is not automatic on final grades. For example, if you earn an 89.5, this is a B+ and
 doesn’t automatically round up to a 90 (i.e. an A-). The only way grades can be bumped up is if there is
 room for a curve in the class.
 Final Exam
 This is only one comprehensive final exam in this course. It is closed-book, closed-note. You may not
 access any materials or resources during the exam, and you are to follow all university policies regarding
 academic honesty. The Final Exam will be taken online in Canvas and monitored via proctoring software
 called Proctorio. It is required that you set up the proctoring software in advance of taking your final
 exam so that you can contact technical support if needed. Details about signing up for Proctorio will be
 posted in Canvas via announcements and on the Final Exam module. Failure to setup proctoring and take
 the final, will result in a zero on the final.
 Quizzes
 There are 8 short multiple-choice quizzes. The first 3 are combine unit quizzes that cover 2 units worth
 of material (e.g. Unit 1 and 2). The last 5, starting at unit 7 only cover 1 unit of material each. These are
 non-cumulative quizzes based on the unit readings, unit lecture videos, and unit activities you
 complete. Start the unit quiz after you have completed and thoroughly reviewed all of the unit
 content and are comfortable with the concepts. The unit quizzes are scored and you have 60
 minutes to answer all the questions in a quiz. Time begins from the moment you start each Unit
 Quiz and runs continuously: once time begins there is no way to pause it, including loss of
 connectivity or logging out, so please plan accordingly. You may refer back to the unit content
 during the quiz, but all questions must be submitted within 60 minutes of starting the questions.
 You only get one attempt on each unit quiz.


Assessments
There are 10 unit assessments that test your understanding of the content covered in the units of
the course except Unit 9. These assessments come in many forms such as short essays, multiple-choice
quizzes, interactive role-plays, and more. These assessments are graded and you should follow the
course schedule for when each assessment should be completed. You may refer back to the unit
content while completing the assessments. NOTE: Some assessments are graded using anonymous
peer evaluations that follow a provided rubric. Also most assessments you only get 1 attempt EXCEPT
for the interactive quizzes. For these quizzes, it will note if there are actually 2 attempts on the
assessment since it is an auto-graded interactive. Please note that once you complete the interactive
quizzes a grade should be posted to Canvas immediately and it will show you results immediately after
the quiz. If not reattempt the assignment because no exceptions will be made if you don’t monitor
grades proactively. Also, note that If you reattempt these a 2nd time the grade you get on the 2nd
attempt will be averaged with the grade of your 1st attempt.
Excel Assignments
Follow the Course Schedule in this syllabus carefully to determine when each assignment is due. It is
not up to the professor to remind you about dates.
The first 5 assignments were designed to get you familiar with Excel. These assignments are scored
automatically using a tool called SAM. If you have no background in Excel, you should follow the step-
by-step instructions provided with each assignment. These assignments require you to complete a
template, and these templates cannot be altered in any way or you will not get credit for that
assignment. If you run into any problems with your assignments, first check out the optional SAM Excel
training links provided or the Mindtap/SAM Tips page in Canvas. If these are not helpful please post on
the discussion board and then search the web or YouTube for Excel tutorials. As a last resort, you can
message your professor and TA directly through a Piazza private message but only after you have
exhausted other resources (e.g. Google, YouTube, public Piazza post) You are expected to learn Excel on
your own because employers want to hire people who are problem solvers and critical thinkers.
Extra Credit Assignments
There are two assignments you may complete for extra credit. The first is an introduction into HTML
and CSS. For this assignment, you will build a simple webpage and host it online. HTML assignment
will be peer graded using a Canvas rubric. If you submit an HTML extra credit website, you will be
required to complete up to 3-4 peer reviews. These reviews count as 20% of your HTML extra credit
grade. You may also choose to complete a BI Excel Assignment for extra credit points. NOTE:
Participation in extra credit can only improve one’s grade, it can’t hurt your grade. Points earned on
the extra credit just gets added to your overall earned points that will be divided by the 1375 possible.
Course Schedule for Graded Assessments and Assignments
Following this schedule will ensure you complete the course on time. Though you’re expected to
complete all the assessments and assignments in this table, the right-hand column indicates
required completion dates. If you don’t complete the assignments by the required dates here, you
will lose all the points, no exceptions! PLEASE make note of all deadlines and do not procrastinate
on starting the work earlier in the week.

Course Polices
 You are encouraged to access this course 3 to 5 times per week and not just on weekends. By
 doing so you will be able to actively participate, complete your assignments, and access
 announcements in a timely manner and avoid risk. Time management is your best asset in this class
 and poor time management typically is the major reason grades can suffer in this online class.
Code of Ethics
 The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
 responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in
 detail in the BBA Program’s Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at
 http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics.
Academic Integrity
 Students of the University of Texas and this course may not share or distribute materials that could
 be an advantage to another current or future student, and the university has no tolerance for acts
 of scholastic dishonesty. If you are caught committing an act of academic dishonesty such as turning
 in someone else’s assignment or copy/pasting from someone’s assignment, OR sharing your work
 with others for their own use in completing an assignment you will receive a zero on that assignment
 and the incident will be referred to Student Judicial Services for their investigation. Please note that
 while I would prefer to meet with you one on one to discuss this but due to the volume of students in
 this class and its online nature, we cannot meet with each offender so matters will simply be referred
 and handle between students in potential violation and SJS. For more on UT’s policy of Academic
 Dishonesty and Cheating, following the link here: http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-
 information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-conduct/
Students with Disabilities

 time you are required to discuss this with the professor
Academic Rigor, MIS 302F Workload, and Managing Deadlines
 Welcome to The McCombs School of Business. In order to challenge you and truly add to your
 education, the McCombs School is committed to rigorous classes. This means that you can expect a
 substantial workload in many of the weeks during the semester. This course, while for non-business
 majors, is in no way a “business light” course and will require significant reading, participation,
 assignment completion, learning of new concepts and critical thinking processes.
Late Assignments and Responsibility of Turning in Work Properly
 Deliverables are due at designated times as outlined on the course schedule and in specific formats, all
 of which will be described in assignment criteria. To be fair and to get assignments graded and returned
 in a timely fashion, the deadlines are critical. Please turn things in correctly.
 All of your work must be submitted before the deadline. For example, if an assignment is required by
 11:59PM and you submit your work at exactly 11:59PM, your assignment will be considered late.
 Essays, Excel, or HTML Assignments submitted after the due date, even 1 second after the deadline will
 receive deduction equaling 50% of the max points of that assignment. (Example: Excel 1 is worth 50
 points. If you turn it in late you will receive 25 points off the assignment grade you earn). After 24
 hours past the initial deadline, these assignments will not be accepted for grading. For Unit Quizzes and
 Unit Assessments, no late work will be allowed, even 1 second later. TIP: Start work early and plan to
 turn it in at least a few hours early so you can manage issues like internet connectivity and computer
 crashing. ANOTHER TOP: PLEASE double-check your deliverables after you submit to ensure it’s
 submitted correctly. If your file is not submitted correctly, you will not receive full credit for the
 assignment.
