COURSE ASSIGNMENTS AND EVALUATION
Class Participation (15%)
You are expected to arrive in class having completed the readings assigned for that day.
Readings are critical to fully understanding and engaging with the topics covered in this class.
Active participation, from all members of the class, is crucial to the success of any doctoral
seminar. Although your personal experiences may be relevant, the most valuable contributions
will be your scholarly rather than personal opinions and will reflect your efforts to synthesize
and apply course readings. Students will be given feedback regarding class participation from
the instructor before the midterm period.
Discussion Questions (30%)
Students should upload their discussion questions for the following week to CANVAS
(deadlines: 11:59 pm Saturday for Tuesday readings, 11:59 pm Tuesday for the Thursday
reading). Each reading requires one question. Along with the question, provide a brief
background of your idea and clearly identify the chapter or article on which your question is


                                                                                                Oh 2
based. Submit your questions in a word file with your name at the top. Each submission
should be less than one page (single-spaced).
Good questions are meant to promote discussion. Questions might reflect the elements of the
reading you felt that warrant further scrutiny or you found fascinating and worth further
exploration, including possible applications and comparisons between the reading and other
scholarship. You are also free to propose topics you feel well-equipped to discuss. Class
discussions will center around these questions. Try to be open-ended in your queries.
You will be allowed to skip one discussion question (representing any one reading) without
penalty. Additional missed questions will adversely affect your score.
Note: For the Thursdays when student-led discussions are scheduled, email your discussion
question to the week’s discussion leader by the due date/time. The discussion leader is
responsible to collect all questions with their names and email me one document by
Wednesday at noon.
Student-led Class Discussion (5%)
Each student will be assigned to lead a day of discussion in the class.
(a) The discussion leader will prepare a ten-minute presentation in class. A PPT or any
visual material can be used during the presentation. The presentation should include: the
article’s theoretical backgrounds, method, results, and the leader’s interpretation and
critique on the study’s theoretical implications. Submit your PPT to CANVAS by 11:59
PM on the day before your presentation.
(c) The presentation will be followed by the class discussion on the article. Leading the
class discussion will involve classifying the discussion questions from your colleagues into
a few groups in advance and suggest your ideas on how to look for answers to the
questions. Involve your classmates into the discussion one by one by asking them to
elaborate on the questions. Do not try to answer all questions by yourself – leave a room for
us to discuss and lead us to collectively figure out the answers.
Theory Extension Project (50%)
The main assignment in this class will be a theory extension project that will involve several
steps outlined below. The overall objective of this assignment is to propose an extension of the
theory that you are interested in and design an empirical study based on your idea. Refer back to
the readings of the second week.
     1. Research Statement (5%): Write your research statement, focusing on the topics and
        areas of advertising research and/or the aspects of human psychology that you are
        genuinely interested in. Conclude it with a potential theory or theories that you may be
        interested in investigating more during your PhD years. Refer to the list of theories in


                                                                                            Oh 3
   this syllabus, your textbook, or any other sources that may be relevant. Submit a Word
   document (double-spaced; less than 3 pages).
2. Research Question (5%): Based on your research statement, write a research question for
   the project using one or two theories. Submit a 3-page overview of the research question
   (double-spaced), including:
•  a description of the theory or theories that you intend to extend, and
•  a brief explanation of why this question is theoretically meaningful and why you believe
   it to be practically important.
   You will share your idea with your classmates and the instructor through a brief oral
   presentation in class and receive our feedback.
3. Annotated Bibliography and Hypotheses (10%): An annotated bibliography,
   summarizing literature relevant to your project, will provide the foundation for your
   project. Based on this literature review, you will propose a set of hypotheses you want to
   empirically test. Your assignment should include:
•  a list of several potential readings that you will use in developing your literature review,
   along with a brief (4-5 sentences) summary of how each is relevant to your topic (Note:
   the summaries should explain the basic predictions you are making and any theories or
   previous findings critical to those predictions), and
•  a set of hypotheses that are empirically testable based on your predictions.
4. Method and Measurement (4%): You will describe your current thoughts regarding the
   method and measurement you will employ to test your overarching research question
   and hypotheses. More detail is better than less, with the hopes that I can help suggest
   ways to develop your study. Your assignment should include:
•  how you will recruit participants,
•  what method you will use (e.g., survey, experiment, a single-factor experiment, a
   factorial-design experiment, etc.),
•  study procedure and/or stimulus, and
•  the definition and measurement of your variables and citations.
5. IRB Paperwork (not required): You can complete the IRB paperwork only if you are
   interested in actual data collection within this semester. You should finish IRB training
   and submit a Financial Interest Disclosure (FID) through our website
   (https://research.utexas.edu/ors/human-subjects/). The IRB application will require you
   to submit a research proposal that includes your research topic, method, and a sample
   questionnaire.
6. Final Presentation (6%): As an academic, you will be expected to share your ideas at
   conferences. The presentation in this class will be an opportunity to explain your
   research proposal to your classmates, discuss your extension of theory, and make a case


                                                                                               Oh 4
      for its theoretical and practical impact as if you were in a conference. Regardless of
      your presentation schedule, your submission is due 11:59 pm Monday Dec 2. No
      revision is allowed after submission.
  7. Research Proposal (20%): The final assignment for the class will be a research proposal
      that (a) explains the theory extension you are proposing and (b) proposes an empirical
      study that can test your hypotheses with a complete method section. Your research
      proposal should include “article-ready” introduction, literature review, method, and
      references. The goal for this final paper is that you leave the class with a paper that could
      be submitted to a conference in the next semester after data collection and analysis.

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HONOR CODE
Core values of UT Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity,
and responsibility. Each member is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty,
trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
POLICY ON SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY
(http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php)
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning
process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and
submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and
must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and
readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University.
POLICY ON RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS OBSERVANCE
(http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi03-04/ch4/ch4g.html#attendance)
The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student
from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of
a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under
this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an
examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable
time after the absence.
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence
as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable
