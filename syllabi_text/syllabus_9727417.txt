Description: With an emphasis on rock, pop, rap, disco, and country in the US since 1945, this
course will look closely at individual songs as a means to understand larger trends in US
cultural history (including various Civil Rights movements, de-industrialization and economic
dislocation, cultural polarization, anti-war movements and the backlash, etc.). Please note that
this course is not primarily musicological in approach, but instead looks at popular song through
the lens of cultural studies, sociology, and history. Many artists will be considered on a list that
ranges across genres and even national boundaries. Not all are Americans, but all of these
artists were important to particular moments and movements in recent American history. More
than anything, we will be learning to listen closely and to think about music as a portal onto
cultural landscapes.
Readings
Five books (on Blondie, Tribe Called Quest, Devo, Celine Dion, and disco) are available at the
coop. I will also post links for various online readings and videos. Please note that everything
must be watched or read by class time on the day it’s listed.
