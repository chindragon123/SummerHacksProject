Course Overview
The Capstone is focused on learning how to create 2D games using industry standard tools
and best practices in medium-size interdisciplinary teams. Topics covered are game
ideation, prototyping, testing, and iterating. Teams use the agile/scrum development
methodology as the framework for completing their games. Learning team dynamics, as
well as development best practices, is core for creating games and the class. In addition,
there is an emphasis on connecting the work performed in class to that being done in
industry. Industry partners playtest games and provide feedback, and the class presents
their post-mortems within a game studio. Students become prepared to find the
appropriate position and ability to work within a studio environment. In the end, teams
make awesome games to show prospective employers and the public!
This course has the Independent Inquiry flag.

Computer Policy
Your computer is to stay closed unless otherwise indicated by the professor. Mobile phones
are not to be used in class. If there is an emergency, please leave the class.
Professionalism
This course is a preparation for employment in a studio. Therefore we expect you to act in
class as you would in the workplace. While studios are often informal, they still require
everyone to be respectful of others. Furthermore, attendance both for the class and when
your team meets are critical. How your teammates view the quality and quantity of your
work, as well as your team skills are important. Finally, how much work you produced, as
recorded in agile dev software tool, will be considered.
