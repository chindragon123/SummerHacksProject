                                      Course Description
This course provides an introduction to the historical and contemporary experiences of
Native American peoples of North America. Though our primary focus will be on tribal
communities in the United States, some attention will be paid to First Nations of Canada
and Mexico as well. Students will be exposed to a range of “voices,” including Native
American artists, scholars and activists, Native and non-Indian social scientists that
specialize in the culture, history, and anthropology of Native North America. The readings
will range from primary historical documents and ethnographies, to creative and
autobiographical accounts. Course content will cover key issues and topics critical to Native
communities, with an in depth focus on several specific tribes as they are represented in the
required texts.
One organizing theme of the course will be the ongoing relationship between tribal nations
and the US government, a relationship that has been characterized by equal parts
continuity and change. We will explore the tension between Native American autonomy and
dependence that is reflected in the complex legal status and identity that Native Americans
continue to face—as US citizens, as racial “others,” as federal “wards,” and as proud
members of sovereign nations. Understanding how Native Americans have been able to
successfully negotiate this difficult terrain provides an important focus for the lectures and
readings of this course.
By its very nature, a semester long course cannot pretend to cover all of the important
events and topics in Native American social, cultural and political history, and this course is
only intended to serve as an introduction to the field. By the end of the semester, however,
students should have a firm understanding of the great diversity and complexity of Native
North American cultures.
                                         Requirements
Because the course relies upon a blend of lecture and discussion, reading in advance is
required. Students should arrive with questions and ideas, and be prepared to discuss
readings in class. Students are also required to keep up with the key points presented in
each class meeting. If you are having difficulty with any of the ideas presented in class, then
it is your responsibility to meet with other students or to attend my office hours to clarify
course materials. Please use these opportunities to your advantage!
                                                                                              1


Assignments will be due at the beginning of class and there will be no make-up exams,

80 to 83% = B-; 77 to 79% = C+, 74 to 76% = C, 70 to 73% = C-; 67 to 69% = D+, 64 to 66%
= D, 60 to 63% = D-; 59% and below = F.
You will be evaluated on the following basis:
mid-term                                       25%
