         American Catastrophes, Radical Histories
                              AMS 311S (31096)
Instructor: Nicholas Bloom
Fall 2018
Course Overview: Catastrophes, “events producing…violent, wide-spread change
in the order of things,” appear frequently throughout US history and the history of
the Americas, especially those created by human beings: a centuries-long system of
racial slavery, a civil war, genocide of indigenous peoples, two world wars, the
degradation of natural lands, and the mass exploitation of workers are just a few.
        Because catastrophes affect the lives and consciousnesses of so many people
across so much space and time, they invite a plethora of interpretations, from a
variety of different vantage points. Historical narrators—and these can be
professional historians, but also activists, artists, novelists, poets, elementary school
teachers, high school class clowns, parents at a dinner table, etc.—try to make sense
of catastrophes by placing them within certain narratives, under certain kinds of
critical lenses. In this course, we are going to study a selection of important
catastrophes from a variety of historical vantage points that are often given short
shrift by dominant and/or popular narrators of history in American culture. In
doing so, this course aims to challenge easy notions of progress or decline that tend
to dominate popular American political discourse, and instead consider the complex
causes and effects of catastrophes without quickly integrating them into narratives
which we already “understand” as true.
        This course will require that we suspend our idea of the United States as a
single, unified entity. Instead, we will study these catastrophes as events in which
varieties of overlapping groups of people, regions, state and economic powers, and
ideas were brought into tumultuous, violent contact with one another, often against
their will, rarely on an equal playing field, and almost never with an easy resolution
back to a clear, American “norm” or conclusion.
        On the flip side of this focus, this course will also study the some of the social,
intellectual, and imaginative creations of those groups most affected by the
catastrophes we consider, creations that often offer alternative visions or even
manifestations of social life. These “radical histories” of American catastrophe we
study here will be as much about the present and the future as they are about the
past.
Essential Questions: Two key sets of questions will run throughout this course:


        Firstly, why are the events/phenomena we study “catastrophes?” What are
the overlapping sets of visions, desires, material forces, and coincidences that
created the catastrophe, and how did the catastrophe effect different people and
places differently? We will pay particular attention to the ways that catastrophes
interact with, shape, and destroy social power structures, such as racial and gender
categories, state power, and distribution of wealth.
        Secondly, how do various groups of people respond to catastrophes? What
lessons do various actors learn from catastrophes, and how do these lessons
generate responses in both the realm of ideas and material action? Why should we
study or care about the catastrophe we are studying? How do catastrophes provoke
our imaginations, and how do they inspire as well as paralyze us? Can catastrophe
be ongoing, and are human-made catastrophes inevitable parts of civilization? Have
people attempted to generate social visions of catastrophe-less civilization?
A Note on the Readings: While some of the readings for this course will be the
work of academic historians, this course will pay special attention to the creative
and political work of activists, intellectuals, and artists not necessarily in the
academy, many of them contemporary to the catastrophes we are studying. These
thinkers are generally engaged in attempts to explain the roots of the catastrophes
they describe, often in attempts to imagine or create cultures and societies in which
catastrophe is not programmed in to the order of things. In this sense, they
represent radical responses to the catastrophes they describe, in the original sense
of the word: to get at the “root” of something. Whether or not these writers do get to
the root of the catastrophes we study will be our task to consider; yet their attempts
will be models for us as we investigate and ruminate on the power of various
catastrophe in US history.
Course Format: Leading Discussion and Reading Responses: This course will be
run primarily as discussion-based seminar, with intermittent historical lectures by
the instructor when appropriate. Since it is a discussion-based seminar, student
preparation and participation are vital and mandatory.
Leading discussion: Throughout the course, you will be required to help lead
discussion one time. You should come prepared to give a brief, 5-10 minute
presentation on the biography of the author we are studying that day, as well as at
least five discussion questions to provoke class discussion. You must submit your
discussion questions and a brief outline of their presentation at least 48 hours in
advance of your assigned class period.
Reading Responses: Students are required to write six one-paragraph-long reading
responses throughout the semester. These responses should demonstrate a
thorough engagement with the text you are writing about, and also engage with the
question: what does this text have to do with catastrophe? In order to answer this
question, use the “Essential Questions” section above to consider the many ways the
text might be wrestling with catastrophe. These responses are explorations and


provocations, and do not have to come to a clear conclusion. They can even function
as a series of thorough questions, or end with a question, if you so choose. The most
important thing is that you demonstrate that you have thoroughly wrestled with the
text, even if you feel you haven’t understood it fully. Reading responses are due on
11:59 PM the night before we discuss the text.
Course Expectations: Attendance, preparation, and active participation in class are
mandatory. Students are allowed three unexcused absences from class; with the
exception of emergencies, sickness, or religious holy days, students will lose a half-
grade in their participation grade for each subsequent absence (see
Accommodations section below). In addition to leading discussion and reading
responses, reading quizzes may be issued at instructor’s discretion.
        All written assignments must be turned in on time, and will lose a half-letter
grade for each day late. If there are extenuating circumstances that you know will
cause to you turn in a paper late, you must let the instructor know at least a week in
advance of the due date.
Assignments/Grade Breakdown:
15%: First (Short) Essay [Choice of Two Prompts Instructor Provides: Putting Two
Texts in Conversation]
15%: Second Essay [Developing Your Own Question; Putting two or more texts in
conversation; develop question in consultation with instructor]
25% Final Essay [Expanding one of first two papers, refining question and applying
to “catastrophe” of student’s choice; outside research necessary]
20% Weekly Response Posts
10% Leading Class Discussion
15% Class Participation [Attendance/Discussion Section Participation]
Accommodations: The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request,
appropriate accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. To determine
if you qualify, please contact the Dean of Students at 471-6259 or 471-4641 TTY. If
the office certifies your needs, I will work with you to make appropriate
arrangements.
        A student who misses an examination, work assignment, or other project due
to the observance of a religious holy day will be given an opportunity to complete
the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence, provided that he or she
has properly notified the instructor. It is the policy of the University of Texas at
Austin that the student must notify the instructor at least 14 days prior to the
classes scheduled on dates he or she will be absent to observe a religious holy day.
For religious holy days that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, the
notice should be given on the first day of the semester. The student will not be
penalized for these excused absences, but the instructor may appropriately respond
if the student fails to complete satisfactorily the missed assignment or examination
within a reasonable time after the excused absence.
