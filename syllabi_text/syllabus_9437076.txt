Course Material
   -  Required: a calculator and the course packet. The course packet is available from the GSB Copy Center.
   -  Recommended (not required): Textbook by Horngren, Datar, and Rajan, Cost Accounting: A Managerial
      Emphasis, 16th edition (or 15th edition)
                                                      1


Course Description
    This course is meant as a survey in the field of cost accounting using case studies.
    Cost accounting systems provide valuable information for management planning and control. Organizations rely
on accurate cost information to decide on which products to keep and which products to discontinue, for assessing
productivity improvements and for performance evaluation and control. An improperly designed cost accounting
system can lead to costly errors in decision-making.
    Intense competition in product markets has forced firms to look inward to become more cost-efficient. Tracing
various resource costs accurately to products has become increasingly important as product margins are squeezed.
Manufacturing environments have also undergone significant changes. To support decision-making in these
environments, cost accounting systems also need to be redesigned.
    Through a number of case studies supplemented by some lectures, this course exposes students to recent advances
in cost accounting, and highlights important inputs into the design of cost systems. The cases cover a variety of
decision-making settings and illustrate the role of cost information in these settings.
    Course objectives are:
    1. To develop an understanding for the important characteristics of good cost systems;
    2. To analyze the role of cost information in a variety of management decisions such as pricing, product mix,
    improving productivity, product design, and performance measurement.
Grading
    Your performance in this course will be evaluated under the following model:
              Homework Case Reports                                        30 points
              Practice Problems                                            20 points
              Mid Exam 1                                                   75 points
              Mid Exam 2                                                   75 points
              Final Comprehensive Exam                                    150 points
              Total                                                       350 points
    There will be no opportunity to raise your course average or grade by doing “extra credit” work during or after
the semester.
    Beginning in Fall 2009, The University of Texas at Austin permits plus/minus grading—that is, A, A-, B+, B, B-
, C+, etc., for all courses in which grades are awarded, including undergraduate as well as graduate courses. To foster
consistency in grading across sections of ACC 359/ACC 387.1, the faculty have adopted plus/minus grading as the
standard for all sections of the course. We believe that plus/minus grading permits us to better distinguish gradations
in performance and provide better feedback to students on their performance.
    In accordance with the Accounting Department Grade Policy/Guideline for the Core PPA courses, Final Course
Grades will be assigned to achieve a final class average GPA between 3.2 and 3.4, inclusive.
Individual Case Homework
    Every student is required to produce a short report for each case (not longer than one page). The reports should
address the following questions: “What are the main issues in the case and how can these issues be addressed?” The
goal of the homework reports is to ensure that students have read each case and understand the problems studied in
the case.
    Students have to upload the homework case reports on Canvas no later than 11:59pm on the day before the
case is discussed (e.g. the deadline for the Giberson’s Glass Studio case is 11:59pm on Wednesday, January 23nd).
                                                            2


No late homework will be accepted. Canvas will not allow you to submit your homework after the deadline.
Assignments submitted in hardcopy and assignments emailed to the professor or to the TAs will not be accepted.
Homework will be graded on a scale of 2 (reasonable effort), 1 (not a good effort), and 0 (not turned in). Your two
lowest homework scores will be dropped. Verbal collaboration (i.e., talking about the assignment) on homework is
allowed. However, the prepared assignment should be your own work (do not borrow, copy or transfer answers or
files from anyone else). For classes in which there is no case discussion, you do not need to prepare a case report.
Text and Homework Practice Problems
     The Horngren, Datar, and Rajan book is an excellent textbook and I recommend that you read it to guide your
understanding of this material. You are responsible for all text chapters assigned.
     I will suggest 6 sets of homework practical problems on Canvas. They will be collected and graded based on
efforts. Homework will be graded on a scale of 4 (reasonable effort), 2 (not a good effort), and 0 (not turned in). Your
one lowest homework score will be dropped. The solutions to the suggested problems will be made available. If you
are having trouble understanding a homework problem or solution, please discuss it with the TA.
     Practical Guidance: If it is in the text but I don’t assign it in a problem or cover it in class, odds are very slim
that it will be a significant component of the exam. Budget your time accordingly.
Exams
     Exams will be individually-completed closed-book exams. The exams will consist of problems, essay questions,
and short answer questions. You may bring a non-programmable calculator to the exams.
- Midterm Exams
     The two midterm exams will be given in the regular class. No make-up exams will be given. Medical emergencies
and family emergencies are the only valid reasons for missing an exam. In such instances, you must provide
supporting documentation (e.g., signed note from your physician). If you miss one midterm exam and you have a
valid and documented reason, your final exam will replace the missing midterm exam grade. For example, if you
have 120 out of 150 points in the final (which is 120/150 = 80%), you get 0.8*75 = 60 points for the missing midterm.
If you do not have a valid and documented reason for missing an exam, you will receive a zero on the exam.
- Final Exam
     The date for our final exam will be announced later. The final exam will be comprehensive and will cover all
topics in the course. Exams will strive to test comprehension, not merely memorization skills. If you have to take the
makeup final due to the conflicted schedule, please submit your request in writing by April 12th at 5pm with a screen
shot of your exam schedule.
- Grading Policy
     1. There are no verbal appeals of grade changes. Review and regrade requests for the exams must be
submitted in writing no later than March 5th at 5pm for the first exam, no later than April 11th at 5pm for the second
exam, and within one week of receiving your grade for the final exam. The entire exam will be re-graded and the
score may increase, remain unchanged, or decrease. After the regrade period, only totaling errors will be adjusted for.
     2. The grade of the final exam, if better, will be averaged with the total of the two midterm exam grades and
will replace the total midterm exam grade. For example, if you have 40 and 60 points in the two midterm exams and
140 points in the final exam, then your total midterm points will be changed from 100 to 120. Of course, if the total
of your two midterm exam grades is better than your final exam grade, then your total midterm points remain
unchanged. This gives everyone a final opportunity to improve their overall grade.
Class participation
     Students must attend their assigned section unless they have specific permission from the Professor to attend a
different section. It is my expectation that you to come to class on time, fully prepared, and ready to open the
discussion.

                                                    Religious Holy Days
     By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order
to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time
after the absence.
                                             Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
     The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of both
students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the BBA Program’s Statement on
Scholastic Dishonesty at http://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics. By teaching this course, I have agreed
to observe all faculty responsibilities described there. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all student
responsibilities described there. If the application of the Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its
assignments is unclear in any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University
rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course
and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the University,
and the value of our academic brand, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You should refer to
the Student Judicial Services website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/ to access the official University policies
and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
                                                       Campus Safety
     Please note the following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation, provided by the Office of Campus
Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety:
     • Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when
     a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
     • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the
     nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
     • Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform the instructor in writing during the first week of
     class.
     • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
     • Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University
     of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050 or submit your concerns using the online form.
     • Further information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at:
