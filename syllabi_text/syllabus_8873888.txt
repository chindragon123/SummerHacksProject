ABOUT THE COURSE
“Modern Western societies struggle with a lack of connection and with a failure to recognize their
interrelatedness. On the other hand, many highly communal societies struggle to make space for
different voices and perspectives. In our wonderfully complex, multi-cultural society, those two
worldviews are living side by side and have the opportunity to learn directly from each other. The
circle is a crucible for that learning. In the Circle we can find a healthy balance between individual
and group needs.” – Kay Pranis
This course is devoted to learning about and implementing restorative practices in education. It will
focus on exploring models of education discipline policies and practices (e.g., zero-tolerance policy,
suspension, expulsion), and how it adversely affects students’ social and emotional development and
academic trajectories; and most importantly, how restorative practices could serve as an alternative
model to address discipline in schools. The course will give special attention to the history and
principles of restorative practices as it relates to the school and the larger community; and
particularly, how restorative practices could serve as a way to address discipline by shifting the
emphasis from punishment to one focused on responsibility, accountability, respect, and restoration.
It is expected that in this course students will become familiar with the restorative process and will
come to understand how to facilitate restorative circles to build relationship and trust with students,
parents, peers and the community.
COURSEWORK OVERVIEW
This course is a collaborative teaching model that mirrors the restorative process. Students are
expected to contribute toward building and maintaining a deeply respectful and highly participatory
learning environment. Students can draw on their own life experiences, readings, and classroom and
community experiences to participate and contribute to class activities and discussions. Course
materials will be presented through a combination of restorative circles, class discussions, guest
lecturers, role-playing, student presentations and videos.

INDEPENDENT INQUIRY FLAG
This course carries the Independent Inquiry Flag. Independent Inquiry courses are designed to
engage you in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing you with the
opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related to your major.
You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from the independent
investigation and presentation of your own work.
ATTENDANCE POLICY
You are expected to attend class, to arrive on time, to have prepared assigned reading and writing,
and to participate in all in-class activities and discussions.
The course instructor will take attendance at every class:
    •    Missing two to four classes will result in the automatic loss of a letter grade.
    •    Should you miss the equivalent of five class sessions this semester, excused or not,
         you will fail the course.
If you find that an unavoidable problem prevents you from attending class, you should contact your
instructor as soon as possible, preferably ahead of time, to let her know.
You will not be penalized for missing class on religious holy days. A student who misses classes or
other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should
inform the instructor, in writing, well in advance of the absence, so that alternative arrangements can
be made to complete work. If you know you will have to miss class(es) for this reason, provide your
instructor with the date(s) as early as possible. Please note that the University specifies very few
other excused absences (e.g., jury duty). Documented illnesses will be considered on an individual
basis. Please do not make medical or other appointments on class days.
When you must miss a class, you are responsible for getting notes and assignments from a classmate
or meeting with the instructor to make arrangements to make up work.
Class Tardiness Policy
Three tardies counts as one absence. Arriving at class 20 or more minutes late also counts as an
absence.
CANVAS
Canvas is the primary platform through which I will communicate with you during the semester.
Please make sure you are receiving Canvas alerts and submit all assignments electronically on
Canvas. If you have any difficulty using Canvas, call 855-308-2494 or live chat with Canvas Support
on-line.

WRITING AND PROPER CITATION
All assignments should be written in APA 6 style, meaning 1-inch margins all around, double-
spaced, using Times New Roman 12 point font. You should carefully and thoroughly cite any
information you use from published materials. Failure to do so could have serious consequences,
including failing an assignment, failing the course, or suspension from the University. Policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. Here is a web site with information on plagiarism.
Please review thoroughly: http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/writing/plagiarism.pdf
All formal written assignments will be graded according to the following criteria:
    • The degree to which the assignment has been completed thoroughly.
    • The degree to which the assignment has been polished and edited carefully.
    • The degree to which the assignment shows insight/thoughtfulness with respect to the topic,
         other course readings, and other classroom/teaching or reading experiences.
COMPUTER USAGE
Computers will be used at times for class activities. Otherwise, they should be kept closed unless
you are taking notes. As a professional, it is imperative that you are present mentally,
physically, and emotionally for all parts of class. I expect to see your active participation
throughout the class.
DATA MANAGEMENT
Back up your data! Computers, phones, and all electronic devices with processors, will break or
malfunction. It is your responsibility to manage the data that is important to you, including your
work for this class. You have many options to do so quickly and affordably, from cloud storage
with your UTexas Box account, as well as external hard drives or flash drives.

ABSENCE FOR MILITARY SERVICE
In accordance with sections 51.9111 of the Texas Education Code, a student is excused from
attending classes or engaging in other required activities, including exams, if he or she is called to
active military service of a reasonably brief duration. The maximum time for which the student may
be excused has been defined by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board as “no more than
25 percent of the total number of class meetings or the contact hour equivalent (not including the
final examination period) for the specific course or courses in which the student is currently enrolled
at the beginning of the period of active military service.” The student will be allowed a reasonable
time after the absence to complete assignments and take exams.

                                    COURSE ASSIGNMENTS
        1. Participation and Professionalism (30 points)
Professionalism includes being on time, prepared for class, and participating actively in whole class
and small group discussions and activities. Computers will be used at times for class activities.
Otherwise, they should be kept closed unless you are taking notes. These expectations will be the
basis for your grade:
    • Actively listening and participating (talking) during whole class and small class activities,
    • Being involved and engaged during the entire class time,
    • Being prepared for class, having read ALL readings and done all assignments/homework
    • Talking to the instructor about any concerns you have with the class,
    • NOT engaging in activities not related to class (e.g., emailing, texting, social media,

        (due on the Tuesday/Thursday before class by 12:00 pm)

practices in education. You are responsible for reading all course readings and writing a response to
share your thinking/questions/experiences with regards to restorative practices. Please post your
reading response to Canvas/Discussion. You must bring your textbook and other readings to class
each week.
As you interact with the readings, reflect on your personal lived-experiences (e.g., education, work),
respond to ideas you find especially compelling, elaborate on your thinking by making connections
to other readings or your experiences, and outline your puzzles and/or questions. It is “essential
that you attend to your felt reactions, and attempt to sort out what those reactions tell you …
[think] about [your] expectations and assumptions” (Zeichner & Liston, 2010). Read the
assignments through the eyes of an individual striving to positively work with youths and the
community. Think about how you can use this knowledge to extend or challenge what you already
know about students, teaching and learning, building relationships, community, and trust.
Instructions for writing your reading responses:
        • Please do not summarize the readings.
        • Your reading response should include one insight (Aha!) and one question (Huh?).
             Your Aha! and Huh? only need to be a sentence in length, but under each you will
             provide a brief explanation (100-300 words) as to how you arrived at your insight
             and why you are asking your question. *Note: You may also include Hmm…, N-
             uhh, No, Yay!
