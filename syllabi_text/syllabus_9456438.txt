Course Description:
This course focuses on the history of medieval Europe primarily through the lens of material culture.
In addition to manuscripts, we will explore the significance of several categories of historical
artifacts including: art, textiles, relics and reliquaries, architecture, pottery, crowns, jewelry and
seals. We will discuss what we can discover about the production, circulation, reception, historic and
geographic context, and the meaning attributed to the materials from which these objects were
created. This class explores what these objects reveal about the religious, political, economic,
cultural, and intellectual history of medieval Europe, beyond what we can learn from medieval texts
and how these objects may have been experienced in a pre-modern world.
Objectives:
    • Learn to analyze and articulate meaning from primary sources created in the Middle Ages -
        both texts and material culture.
    • Learn to read and think critically about pre-modern time periods.
    • Become more aware of material culture and the significance of space in both the medieval
        and modern world.
    • Develop a deeper understanding of cultures and beliefs that may be different from our own.
        (Note that this course has a Global Cultures flag)

Course Packet available at University Co-op
Additional required images and texts will be made available electronically on Canvas.

Cerego Map Exercise:
This class will use a digital tool called Cerego to test and improve geographic literacy. Geographic
literacy helps us to deepen our understanding of the complex processes of the past when we have a
better grasp of time, space and place. You will complete a series of digital map exercises that
reinforce your knowledge of the geography of the Mediterranean region. You will be REQUIRED to
complete these exercises for THREE WEEKS for 5% of your grade. (Nota Bene: the regional
boundaries in the Middle Ages were porous and constantly changing, so the boundaries indicated in
Cerego are only approximate.)
Class Expectations:
I expect you to attend class regularly and be prepared to take notes and to participate actively and
respectfully in discussions. The required reading assignments must be completed BEFORE class.
Bring your course packet to class when reading has been assigned.
Required Presentation:
Ten minute class presentation on a medieval material object selected from list provided by professor.
You are required to turn in a short written paper with answers to the Who, What, When, Why, and
How for the object you have chosen and include at least one secondary source that you used. (Note
that the source may NOT be Wikipedia)
Additional Class Policies and Notes:
     1. Sign up for initial 10 minute visit in my office during the first two weeks of class.
     2. Computers and tablets will NOT be allowed in this course (unless you provide
        documentation that accommodation is needed).
     3. Turn off your phone for the duration of the lecture, or place your phone on vibrate. If your
        phone rings during class, I reserve the right to answer it.
     4. Attend all class meetings, arrive on time, and sign the daily sign-in sheet. After two
        absences, each subsequent unexcused absence subtracts 5 points from your class
        participation AND attendance grade. Excused absences require a note to the professor
        BEFORE class or within one week after the missed class.

       emergency evacuation procedures. When a fire alarm is sounded we must exit the building,
       proceed to the nearest stairs, and assemble outside. If you will need assistance leaving the
