University Course Description
The concept of culture; social and political organization; language; the supernatural; elementary cultural
theory. May be counted toward the cultural diversity flag requirement. Meets core curriculum
requirement for Social & Behavioral Science (I).
Detailed Course Description
As an academic discipline, Anthropology is divided into four sub-fields (1) cultural (2) physical (3)
linguistic and (4) archeology. Together these four sub-fields combine to form a composite understanding
of humans, or Anthropos, and are together what we consider anthropology. This course is concerned with
the first of these four listed subfields, cultural anthropology, the inductive study of humans’ societal
arrangements. Through cultural anthropology we gain insight into the way culture interacts with a
material world. This is done through rigorous examinations of particular human subjects within a
historical and cultural context using methods particular to anthropology. These methods as well as other
concepts and theories prominent within the field of cultural anthropology shape this course.
This course is run somewhat chronologically. We begin by looking at the origin of cultural anthropology
which largely revolved around the issue of scientific racism and eugenics with anthropologists on either
side of the debates of (white) racial superiority. From there we will examine texts foundational to
American anthropology before delving into texts that detail the development of the discipline’s primary
method: ethnography. After looking at the development of ethnography we will spend the rest of the
course looking at 20th century discourses that saw the field transition from a largely structural study of
cultural patterns to a post-structuralist, reflexive study questioning any and all knowledge claims
regarding culture. Throughout the class we will look at articles and media discussing anthropological
theory as well as ethnographic accounts from cultural anthropologists and others that cumulatively paint
the picture of what cultural anthropology is and does.
Course Objectives
This course aims 1) to develop the students’ ability to comprehend prevailing discourses in the field of
cultural anthropology, including both methodological and theoretical contributions, and to 2) enhance
their self-awareness as well as their ability to understand and empathize with those from various cultures.

Course requirements and general policies
Required Materials — There is one book you will need to purchase at the bookstore (all other readings
will be available on Canvas):
Kulick, Don. Travesti: Sex, Gender, and Culture among Brazilian Transgendered Prostitutes.
         Chicago: University of Chicago Press.
All other readings are available electronically through Canvas at: https://utexas.instructure.com/
An Advisory about the Readings — Several texts we will be reading this semester contain explicit
accounts of sexual practices and violence. We will be approaching these materials—as with all of the
materials discussed in this class—in an anthropological fashion. That means we work to empathize with
the experiences of others and we discuss them in a respectful fashion. If you have concerns about the
readings and the issues discussed in them, please speak with the instructor or a TA as soon as possible.
Preparation for Class — To assist your reading for each lecture, questions for each reading will be posted
on the Canvas website. You should use these questions to guide your reading; they point out the
particular issues and data that you need ultimately to take away from the reading. I recommend that you
do your best to answer these questions as you do the reading before class. You are welcome to work with
classmates to develop your answers to these questions. Then, bring your answers along with the reading
to the lecture, where the reading will be discussed further. Following the lecture, you should be


comfortable answering the questions on the reading. Again, I encourage you to speak with your
classmates about the answers to these questions before and after the lecture. If you are uncertain how to
answer some of the questions, you will have the chance to ask questions during your discussion section.
Section leaders are not there to provide answers to these questions, though they will facilitate discussion
and ask questions that help you to answer the reading questions.
Most weeks at the end of your discussion section, you will have a quiz that consists of one of the
questions on the previous week’s readings. At this point, if you have done the reading, attended lecture,
worked with classmates to develop answers to the questions, raised any residual questions during your
discussion section...at this point, it should prove easy to answer any of the questions from the previous
week’s readings. Some of the reading questions will also appear on midterms and finals, so you are
encouraged to retain your answers to these questions to review in preparation for these exams.
Grading — Your grade consists of four components:
One-question quizzes 35%
Midterm 25%
Final 30%
Attendance & Participation 10%
One-question quizzes: There will be 12 quizzes over the course of the semester and your lowest quiz
grade will be dropped before calculating your final grade. Your 11 best quiz grades compose 35% of your
final grade. These quizzes will consist of one reading question selected from the questions given out with
the previous week’s readings. Different sections will not necessarily have the same question. Quizzes are
closed book. You are allowed—encouraged, in fact—to discuss the questions ahead of time with
classmates. Quizzes will be graded with either a check plus, check, check minus, or zero.
         A check plus (= 100) is reserved for responses that are particularly thoughtful and draw
                  connections to other readings or larger themes discussed in the class.
         A check (= 88) is given for responses that offer a satisfactory but not particularly developed
                  response to the question.
         A check minus (= 76) is given for answers that are not, for the most part, satisfactory but show
                  some familiarity with the reading.
         A zero (= 0) is given for missed quizzes and answers that show no familiarity with the reading.
Midterm & Final Exams: There will be midterm and final exams. The midterm will be given in class and
the final will be given during the assigned final slot for our class. You should not book tickets or make
travel plans before finding out when our final exam will be held (see
http://registrar.utexas.edu/students/exams).
The midterm and final will consist of multiple choice, short answer, and analysis questions. The questions
you are given with the reading for each class will form the basis of some exam questions as will the


material covered in lectures. We will have review classes for both exams that will go over material from
lectures that you should be prepared to answer questions on. The best preparation for exams is to: 1) work
through the reading questions in the way described above 2) attend lectures and take notes, paying
attention not only to answering the reading questions, but to other materials introduced in lectures that are
not in the readings; 3) review your lecture notes and discuss them with classmates; 4) raise any questions
you have about lectures during discussion section; 5) if questions remain after discussion section, raise
your questions in office hours with me or your TA; and 6) attend the review sessions for the exams held
during the lecture period prior to the exam. The midterm comprises 25% and the final 30% of your final
grade.
Attendance and Participation: Regular attendance and participation in discussion sections accounts for
10% of your grade. Grades are given as follows:
         100 - 2 or fewer missed section meetings with regular participation
         92 - 2 or fewer missed section meetings
         85 - 3 missed section meetings
         Etc. - An additional 5 points is taken off for every additional section meeting that is missed
The grade ranges are as follows:
94 to 100% = A, 90 to 93% = A-; 87 to 89 = B+, 84 to 86 = B, 80 to 83% = B-; 77 to 79% = C+, 74 to
76% = C, 70 to 73% = C-; 67 to 69% = D+, 64 to 66% = D, 60 to 63% = D-; 59% and below = F.
Excused Absences & Make-ups — The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious
holidays and for extenuating circumstances due to an emergency (with a note from a doctor, nurse, or
university official documenting the emergency). If you plan to miss class due to observance of a religious
holiday, you must notify the instructor at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of the
religious holiday. You will be given an opportunity to complete missed work within a reasonable time
after the absence. Otherwise, there will be no make-up quizzes or exams without a note from a doctor,
nurse, or university official excusing your absence.
Inside & Outside the Classroom — Readings for the day’s class should always be brought to class. I
recommend that you print out readings available electronically on Canvas so that you are not dependent
on electronic devices to do class readings. Computers, phones, and other electronic devices are allowed in
class so long as they are not disruptive to others. If these devices become disruptive, I will ask that they
not be brought into class. As long as these devices are not disruptive to others, you are solely responsible
for how you use these devices in class. Your TA and I are not responsible for rehashing material that you
miss because you are distracted by electronic devices or because you are absent (unless the absence is
excused). If you miss a class, you should speak with your classmates to catch up on course
announcements and notes. If you attend class and discussion section and still have questions about class
materials, please see me or your TA during office hours. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are
keeping up with all that is being done in class. Do not hesitate to ask questions in class or during office
hours.


Academic Integrity — Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor
Code:
      “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University
      and uphold academic integrity.”
This means that work you produce on assignments, quizzes and exams is all your own work, unless it is
assigned as group work. You are welcome to work with classmates to prepare for quizzes and exams, but
you may not help each other in any way while taking quizzes and exams. All quizzes and exams are
closed book. Copying answers from any source during quiz or exam periods is a serious offense and you
will be subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
understanding UT’s Academic Honesty Policy which can be found at the following web address:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
