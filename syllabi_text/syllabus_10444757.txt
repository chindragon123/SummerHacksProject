Textbook: Elementary Number Theory and Its Application, 6th edition, by Kenneth H. Rosen.
Prerequisites and degree relevance: M341 or M325K, with a grade of at least C-. This is
a first course that emphasizes understanding and creating proofs; therefore, it must provide a
transition from the problem-solving approach of calculus to the entirely rigorous approach of
advanced courses such as M365C or M373K.
Homework: There will be homework assignments due on Tuesdays and Fridays. Homework
should be submitted via Gradescope. Late homework will not be accepted for any reason. One
lowest homework score will be dropped at the end of the semester.
Exams: There will a 75 min. in-class midterm exam (Wed, June 24) and the final exam (Sat,
July 11, 7:00pm-10:00pm). Both exams will be given via Gradescope and will be proctored via
ZOOM. A makeup will be given only if you miss a test because of a university sponsored event
or a documented medical excuse. Class notes, books, cell phones, calculators and other aids
will not be allowed.
Grading and Attendance: To compute your final course grade, I will average your homework
(20%), the midterm exam (35%) and the final exam (45%).
