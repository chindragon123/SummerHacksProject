Course Description: This course analyzes the development of Buddhist visual culture
throughout Asia. We will place special attention on the earliest developments in South Asia
(India and Pakistan), as well as how Buddhist art forms changed as the religion spread
elsewhere and over time. Lectures and selected readings introduce key elements for
understanding artistic production in various cultures where Buddhism flourished, with a
particular focus on the interplay between religious issues and other factors that resulted in
specific changes. Students will learn to see commonality in certain developments despite
surface differences, such as in the creation of monuments that mark or articulate sacred space
and the myriad ways in which images play a part in Buddhist practice.
Course Objectives In this course, we will:
    • Determine the various ways in which scholars have sought to define “Buddhist art,” as
       well as the significance of the use of the term “art” in discussion of non-western visual
       cultures both in and outside of museum settings.
    • Analyze the various “parts” of Buddhist religious traditions and how these interact,
       including the production of images, doctrine/theology, ritual practices, and sacred
       space.
    • Identify the ways in which Buddhism and its “art” forms are interconnected with other
       social processes in specific cultures and societies (including economies and politics).
    • Identify various ways in which Buddhist artistic production (and at times its
       destruction) bolstered power for both individuals and social groups.
    • Explore similarities and differences between Buddhist traditions and their art forms in
       specific contexts, looking at issues of use-function, style, and iconography.
Required Textbooks:

        Boston: Shambala, 2009 (paperback; 2008 hardback is also fine).
Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction by Damien Keown. Oxford University Press, 2000.

Attendance, Absences, and Your Course Grade
Attending class is mandatory. Student who arrive more than 10 minutes late to class will receive 1/2 of
an absence. You are permitted three unexcused absences over the course of the semester without
penalty. After 3 absences, your final grade will be lowered by one grade for each unexcused absence
thereafter. For example, if you accumulate 5 absences in class, and your final grade is a B+, your grade
will be lowered to a B-; if you accumulate 7 absences, your grade would be a C; etc.
I will not accept late assignments or give makeup exams unless you are able to provide a doctor’s
note or other evidence of a medical and/or family emergency. If you will be absent for an exam, you
must notify me by email at least one hour before class begins that day or you will receive a zero on
your exam. **When in doubt—unless you have a contagious illness and/or a medical or family
emergency—just come to class.**
Religious Holy Days: It is university policy that you must notify me of a pending absence at least 14
days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, assignment,
examination or in-class project in order to observe, I will give you an opportunity to complete the
missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Students’ Coursework Responsibilities
Readings (typically brief) are assigned for each class meeting. In addition to attending class, students
must complete the assigned reading, participate in discussions (both in small groups and as a class),
and complete the coursework detailed below. Students are also expected to complete three exams.
Daily Questions: At the beginning of each class (typically on Weds. and Fridays)—with the
exception of days that reading responses are due (typically Mondays)—students are responsible for
turning in two questions on some aspect of the material we have covered in the course. This is both
part of your participation grade and certification of your attendance for that day. I will select
anonymous questions to discuss at the beginning of each class. If you would definitely like an
answer to one or more of your questions, please note that on your paper and I will contact you
directly. Because of their sheer volume of these papers, daily questions will not be returned to you. It
is therefore wise to keep a section in your course journal to take note of your questions as we
proceed through the semester.
Monday Reading Responses (2 copies): On Mondays, you will usually be responsible for turning in
reading response questions, available on Canvas, for that day’s course readings. This assignment will
be accepted instead of your daily questions (please note: no late reading responses will be accepted;
if you are for some reason unable to complete the assignment, you must instead turn in two questions
to certify your attendance). Because this is a large class, reading responses will not be returned to
you until the end of the semester. After you turn in your assignment, we will go over the questions at
the beginning of class. You should therefore keep one copy of your revised reading response
questions in your course journal – these will be useful to you for exam study.
Friday In-class Writing: Each Friday, students will typically complete a short in-class writing
assignment, which you will then discuss with a partner prior to a participating in a full class
discussion. In-class writing responses, together with corrected reading responses, and a section for
lecture/discussion notes, should be kept in a course journal to be turned in at the end of the
semester.
                                                                      Langberg, Buddhist Art | 2 of 8


No Electronics in Class
Cell phones, tablets, laptops, or other electronic devices are NOT permitted to be used in class
(unless permission is granted in special circumstances by the instructor). Turn all phone sounds off
before class begins. For each class, students are required to bring paper and a writing utensils for
note taking. If you continue using a device inappropriately after being warned by the professor, you
will be asked to leave class resulting in loss of attendance and participation credit for that day.
Class Conduct
This course deals with subject matter potentially relating to religion, race, ethnicity, and identity.
Everyone should feel safe to express their experiences and opinions, but must do so in a respectful
manner, keeping others’ views in mind. There will be no tolerance for disrespectful or discriminatory
dialogue or behavior. Should you violate this policy, you will be asked to leave the class, resulting in
loss of attendance and participation credit for that day.
Office Hours: **DO UTILIZE MY OFFICE HOURS FOR THIS COURSE…
     1. This is the best method to ask me questions about anything we discuss in class.
     2. This is the time to discuss your assignments, grades, and/or exams with me.

I define class participation as: (1) attendance for the duration of our 50-minute class, (2) thoughtful
contributions to class and group discussions, including posing any questions you may have as well as
(3) demonstrated skills in listening and responding to your fellow classmates. I measure participation
not merely by how often you talk, but by how well you contribute to the collective learning process
of the class.
Policies and Sources on Academic Integrity:
“Scholastic dishonesty” includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying
academic records, and any act designed to give unfair academic advantage to the student. This
includes, but is not limited to, submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses
without the prior permission of the instructor and providing false or misleading information (as in an
effort to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment). Students who
violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
                                                                      Langberg, Buddhist Art | 3 of 8


possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms
the individual, other students, and the overall integrity of the University, policies on scholastic
dishonesty will be strictly enforced.

reference them during in-class discussions or writing assignments, please plan accordingly. If
you require support in using CANVAS call the Information Technology Services Help Desk at 512-
475-9400, Monday-Friday, 8AM-6PM.
Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence
Since email is an official method of receiving university and course communications, it is important
that your e-mail address on file with the university is kept up to date. I will only be able to contact
you through the address on file. You should check your e-mail regularly to stay current. You can find
