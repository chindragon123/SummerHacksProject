Course Description. This course introduces students to several major strains of 20th and 21st century thought
concerning the relationship of language and social life. We begin by considering the nature of the human symbolic
capacity and its relationship to language, the symbolic medium of humanity par excellence. Mediating human
engagement with the environment, linguistic symbolism enables intersubjective communication of remarkable
scope and, simultaneously, creates the possibility of extensive cultural variability. We ask: what in human language is
universal—enabling species-wide communication—and what restricted in space and time? We explore the vast and
diverse influence of linguistic structuralism on the human sciences, focusing on variants that stress both cultural
diversity (Whorfian) and cognitive universality (Levi-Straussian). And we look at responses to mid-century
structuralism that draws attention to the social, cultural, and political contexts of meaning production.
           In the second half of the course, we turn to a variety of poststructuralist and pragmatist efforts to resolve
the foundational structuralist dichotomy distinguishing language from speech. In an effort to come to terms with
the role of language as the central medium of social life, we ask how language functions as a tool of both microscale
and macroscale social processes. Here, we focus on the ethnographically-sensitive study of speech developed by
linguistic anthropologist over the past 60 years, focusing on several key foci: ritual, interaction, intertextuality, and
circulation.

Class Preparation & Participation. The success of the class depends on everyone’s active and informed
participation. Completing the reading and taking time to process it before arriving in class is essential. So too is
coming with points to raise in discussion. The aim is to develop your critical and constructive perspective on the
material we cover; and the only way to do that is to share your thoughts and engage with others’ perspectives in
class. To help this process along, please come to each class with the following:
                1.   3 brief selections from the week's readings—a sentence, a paragraph—that you find significant.
                     Come prepared to discuss why you find those sections of the reading particularly important in
                     order to understand the argument and contribution the authors aim to make.
                2.   2 points of similarity or contrast among the readings for the week. Why are we reading these
                     texts together? How do they inform, build on, or challenge each other?


                                                                                                                       5
               3.   1 point of similarity or contrast between the week's reading and other readings we've covered in
                    the course or other readings you've encountered elsewhere. Please be prepared to briefly
                    summarize any readings that we might not all be familiar with.
               4.   1 criticism of the week's reading. Feel free to use other readings, other data, or your own
                    research in developing a critical perspective on the week's reading and how the flaws you identify
                    might be overcome.
We will use your selections, comparisons, and criticisms to help organize our discussion. You're welcome to jot
down notes in preparation if you like, but you do not need to turn any of this in.
Essays. There will be one midterm and one final essay of 5-6 double-spaced pages. I will provide prompts a week
or two before the essays are due. The essays will be an opportunity to reflect on and synthesize issues raised in
the readings and in our discussion.
Analysis. You’ll have an opportunity to analyze data of one sort or another using the methods we discuss in the
second half of the semester. There are two forms this can take:
     1. Record, transcribe, and analyze the “poetics” of a social interaction. You may also use material you have
          previously collected or a “found” text, if you prefer. What are the key cultural values/concepts manifest in
          this stretch of discourse? What social activities are being performed by participants?
     2.   Exemplify and describe the linguistic and social features of an interactional genre that is important in the
          social lives of some group of people. How and why is this genre significant for them?
More details about the methods and format will be provided during the second half of the semester. Your analysis
will consist of a 5 page essay and a 2-3 page outline of the key features of the interaction or genre you are
analyzing. This will be due during finals week.
Grading. Grades will be based on the midterm and final essays (25% each), analysis (25%), and participation in
class discussions (25%).
