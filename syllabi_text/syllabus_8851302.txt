The University of Texas at Austin has instituted plus/minus grading for graduate students. Department
of Accounting policy requires that a grading scale including pluses and minuses be used for all
graduate accounting classes. University policy continues to prohibit use of plus/minus grading for
undergraduate students. Department of Accounting policy requires that grades for undergraduate
students enrolled in graduate accounting classes will be determined by dropping the plus or minus (if
any) from their letter grade.
EXAMS. The two exams may consist of multiple-choice questions, short answer, and essay problems.
Exams are provided online in Canvas. While students may use their notes and the text book, no
collaboration among students is allowed. You must complete the exam alone. Prepare for the exams
as if they are not open book as you will only have 60 minutes to complete the exams. This will not be
enough time to look up more than just a few of the questions in your notes or in the textbook.

                                            ACADEMIC HONESTY
Accounting Department Policy:
         The Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The
         responsibility of both students and faculty with respect to scholastic dishonesty are described in
         detail in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty in the MPA Program and
         the Professional Program in Accounting. By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all
         of the faculty responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this class, you have
         agreed to observe all of the student responsibilities described in that document. If the
         application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is
         your responsibility to ask me for clarification.
         The student responsibilities embodied in the department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic
         Dishonesty are consistent with the GSB Honor Code and the University’s General Information
         catalog. However, you should obtain and read the department’s Policy Statement to ensure
         that you understand my responsibilities. Copies are available in CBA 2.302.

that may be available within these sites. Site activities could include exchanging e-mail, engaging in

Campus Safety
Please note the following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office Campus
Safety and Security, (512) 471-5767, utexas.edu/safety/
           Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
            evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
            requires exiting and assembling outside.
           Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
            Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you use when entering the
            building.
           Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform their instructor in writing during
            the first week of class.
           In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
           Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
            Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire prevention
            Services Office.
           Behavior concerns Advice Line (BCAL): (512) 232-5050
