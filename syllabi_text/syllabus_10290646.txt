Course Description
How and when do cities burn? The modern US city has seen its share of urban unrest, typified by street protests
(both organized and spontaneous), the destruction of private property, looting and fires. Interpretations of urban
unrest are varied: some describe it as aimless rioting, others as political insurrection. Most agree that the matter has
something to do with the deepening of racism, poverty and violence in U.S. cities. This course takes a closer look at
the roots of urban unrest, exploring a range of origins: joblessness, state violence, white flight, the backlash against
civil rights gains, new immigration and interracial strife. Urban unrest is often cast as an intractable struggle
between black and white, yet this course examines the ways in which multiple racial groups have entered the fray.
Beyond race and class, the course will also explore unrest as a mode of pushing the normative boundaries of gender
and sexuality in public space. Course material will draw from film, literature, history, geography and anthropology.
