Course Overview:
Reading Assessment and Developments fits within a three-course/three-semester literacy sequence
entitled Literacy, Language, and Learning. This literacy sequence will focus on the theoretical and
practical aspects of literacy instruction, classroom language, and learning. This course emphasizes
methods of reading assessment and development, particularly. The concepts learned in this course will be
extended and enriched in your Language Arts and Reading Methods courses (Fall 2019).
Course Description and Objectives:
This course is focused on the development of reading abilities, motivations, skills, and strategies.
We begin with an exploration of traditional views of reading and learning to read, and then move quickly
on to study current theories of reading acquisition and the reading processes. We will discuss issues of
development, difference, and disability as they relate to learning to read.
The course is organized around lectures, readings, and class discussion. Heavy emphasis will be placed on
developing skills and strategies surrounding the use of tools for the assessment of reading and how these
assessments can inform effective teaching. Assessment strategies will be presented and demonstrated in
class, and you will apply these strategies in mentoring with students at M Station.
This is a field-based course and meets all of the University and State of Texas requirements for a field-
based course. Most lectures, demonstrations, and discussions are conducted in a public learning setting.
Of our 13 courses 3 (July 2nd, 3rd, 22nd) will be at UT. The rest will be at a public learning program. You
will be learning with elementary-aged students each day between July 8 through July 19 at M Station
Learning Center. You will meet with students for a total of 10 class days. This mentorship will provide
you with an opportunity to practice and understand reading development and the assessments we are
learning in class.
By the end of the course, you should be able to:
     ●   identify and describe theories of literacy development,
     ●   closely observe and assess children’s literacy practices and developments,
     ●   locate texts and instructional materials based on a child’s interests and literacy development,
     ●   use informal and formal assessments in order to plan for reading instruction,
     ●   recognize the complex influences of language, culture, race, and gender in the development of literacy
     ●   create a professional case study of one child’s literacy development.
                                                                                                                      1

                                         ATTENDANCE POLICY
Coming to class on time and ready to learn is imperative. Due to the special nature of this class
as a practicum experience and the intensity of a daily class, it is especially important that you do
everything you can to avoid being absent. If you are absent you must contact both Erica
(206.459.0684) and Heather (404.775.4338) prior to class.
If you miss, here are the policies:
    ● No unexcused absences. Each unexcused absence will mean a deduction of a partial
        letter grade in your final grade (i.e. A → A-; A- → B+…etc.)
    ● If unavoidable, one excused absence is allowed (e.g., serious illness, family emergency
        with written documentation).
             ○ Excused absences are typically due to unavoidable events: An unplanned illness
                 doctor's note will be considered an excused absence. However, a routine medical
                 appointment during class time with a doctor’s note is not considered an excused
                 absence.
    ● More than 3 absences (including excused and unexcused) will result in a failing grade for
        the course.
    ● You will be considered tardy if you arrive more than 5 minutes late to class. We begin
        marking tardies at the start of class, so please be in your seat and ready to begin at that
        time.
             ○ Serious or continuous tardiness (or early departures) will affect your grade.
                 Excessive tardies (2 or more) constitutes an unexcused absence.
An excused absence requires you to post a detailed response (2 pages, double spaced) to an
assigned article (see folder in Canvas) due by the Saturday at 5pm the week of your
absence. Please contact Erica and Heather if you have questions or concerns.
Additionally, as a reminder, if you miss mentoring days, it is your responsibility to arrange
for coverage of your teaching with other members of your cohort. You are expected to
provide any needed materials for your cohort teammates.
                                        PROFESSIONALISM (15 points)
Participation
Your class participation grade is based on active participation, including sharing your thoughts
and questions as well as listening to the thoughts and questions of others. This is the expectation
in every class.
                                                                                                       3

Technology Etiquette
Your laptop or iPad should be used for class purposes only. Please silence and put away your cell
phones and other devices that will not be used for class. Your course participation grade will be
negatively impacted if you are seen surfing the web, emailing, texting, or otherwise engaging in
communications that are not class related.
Professional Communication
     ● As teachers you will need to address concerns in a professional manner with colleagues,
         parents, and administrators. Please approach your work in this class in a similar way. If
         you have a concern, please address it directly with Erica and Heather.
     ● When you email, you MUST include both of us. When writing electronic
         communications, adopt an appropriate tone that demonstrates your identity as a teacher.
     ● Another part of professional communication is taking initiative when you have questions
         or concerns--email or text the course instructors.
As long as you are participating in the ways we have specified, you can assume that you are
receiving full credit. If you have questions about this portion of your grade please contact Erica
or Heather.
                                    COURSE READINGS (12 points)
                            (due at 10pm the day before class, see Canvas)
Reading & Reading Responses
One of the major goals for the class is to help you move from thinking like a student (e.g., “How
will it affect my grade?”) to thinking like a teacher (“What can I learn from this?).
Read the assignments through the eyes of a teacher. As you read, note particular questions,
comments, or personal connections with the text using annotations in the margins or using post-
its or electronic comments in your readings. Think about how you can use this new knowledge to
extend or challenge what you already know about students, teaching, and literacy. You must
bring your annotated course readings to class.
Canvas
You are required to respond to all assigned readings on Canvas so that we have an opportunity to
read your thinking. Responses are due at 10 pm the night before class.
A late response is better than no response at all. You have 24 hours for a late reading post to be
accepted, after that time we will not accept your response for credit. If you post after the due
date/time (and within 24 hours), you must email Erica and Heather to let us know to check your
post--we will not return to any assignment after it has already been graded without notification.
Your responses are a space for you to do some extended “writing to think” to prepare for our
discussions and should reflect careful thought. As you compose your response, please stay close
                                                                                                      4


                                                                                    EDC s339D/Unique: 74330
to the text, though you might touch on experiences and your personal history as a student, we
want to keep the text as the central focus. If you include a quote in your response, please include
the page number so that your audience can read and think alongside you.
Writing to Think (from Bomer (2011), Ch. 9 “Writing that Supports Readers’ Meaning Making”)
When students write to think, the concern—for the writer or for the student—should not be on
conventions or forms. It’s not about commas, because this is writing for the writer, and the thing
that matters is that the writer stay focused on meaning and not get distracted into surface
features.
Writing is a strategy, rather than an assignment. When writing is a strategy, the writer is trying
to accomplish something beyond the writing itself—in this case, trying to use writing in order to
build ideas in response to a text. When writing is an assignment, the writer’s attention is taken
up in how to respond to the authoritative demands of the assignment itself: How long is it
supposed to be? What exactly do they want?
In-Class Responding
In class, we will often be reading our peers’ reading responses and providing thoughtful
responses. We hope our class discussion will provide insight into what your peers are thinking,
as well as provide a space to receive comments from a variety of class members. Your reading
and responses will be the foundation of our in-class discussions.
                                 LITERACY LIFE PROJECT (15 points)
                                      (due Wednesday, July 10)
We ask that you reflect on your literacy habits, attitudes, beliefs, development, difficulties,
preferences, and sources of influence as a reader. (Review Paulo Freire’s chapter for inspiration.)
You will interview family members, and other influential people regarding your early literacy
development, and as much as possible collect anecdotes, artifacts, and quotes from your family.
We ask you to please complete an interview and data collection form that we will provide to you
via Google Form. This portion of the project will be worth 5 points.
Part of this work is to recognize your multiple cultural identities, to develop conceptual
understandings of the intersection of your literacy life and culture, and to raise your awareness of
how and why culture matters to each person.
Select three cultural themes to discuss about your background as a literate person and create a
plan for sharing these themes. You will share your literacy life project in class using a slideshow,
a visual representation (e.g., poster, detailed map), artistic portrayal, or other format. Bring your
project to class on July 10th and be prepared to share your cultural themes and supporting
quotes/artifacts. Your physical project and presentation will be worth 10 points.
                                                                                                          5

You will be working with a child or small group of children as part of this course.
    ● You will conduct assessments and provide instruction based on your assessments
    ● You will be responsible for lesson planning and instruction
Teaching Preparation (12 points)
You will be prepared for all teaching sessions and use recommended materials and strategies.
You will complete a lesson plan and reflection for each teaching session. Lesson plans will be
uploaded to Canvas before your teaching session (by 7 am the day you teach). Comments, by
either Erica or Heather will be provided to you. Bring your lesson plan (printed or digital) and
have it visible during teaching.
For all sessions after the 1 st time with your buddy you will submit reflections on and about your
teaching to support you for future sessions. This is to be done before moving to the next teaching
plan and should be completed by 11:59pm each day after you teach.
Teaching Plans/Implementation Requirements
        ● Post your plans/reflections for teaching
        ● All components are included
        ● Ideas from class readings, lectures, and the Longhorn Reader website are
            incorporated into plans
        ● Plans are detailed and easy to understand
        ● Each plan is accompanied by a written reflection after teaching
        ● Running records and other assessments are used to determine and document tutee’s
            performance and development
        ● Feedback from instructors is incorporated into subsequent lesson plans
Longhorn Buddy Materials
Materials for teaching are expected to reflect your child’s interests and personality. For each
teaching session you will create visually stimulating poems, jokes/riddles, word work, etc.
focused around a theme. Additionally, a collection of your work together will be kept in folders.
High quality literature is expected during read aloud each teaching session. Your materials need
to be prepared before your teaching session and before you arrive for class.
UT Mentoring Absence
You must arrange for another student in the cohort to cover your teaching buddy. You must
contact the instructors directly (by text) stating the arrangements you have made.
Longhorn Buddy Absences
If your buddy is absent, sit with a partner, observe and support their work. This is a time for you
to write down your observations and share them with your partner after class. Also, this an
opportunity to learn new ideas. The notes you take during this time will be substituted for your
lesson plan reflections and should be submitted on Canvas.
                                                                                                      6

tutee. Throughout the course, we will ask you to submit updates about what you are learning
from the assessments you conduct. Then, you will produce a case report about your student,
which will be presented orally at the end of the course. Additional information will be provided
in class.
This assignment consists of five parts spread out throughout the course. Use your
phone/camera/tablet to capture everything: work samples, poems, jokes, interviews, etc. These
work samples will be artifacts for this assignment. If you would like to share drafts and get
feedback before due dates, please work with Erica and Heather to set up time for meeting to
discuss questions and draft writing.
Part I: Comprehension and Meaning Making (Read Aloud) (10 points)
        (due July 13 on Canvas)
                    • You will revisit a text with your buddy and ask them to talk to you about
            the text using the template on Canvas. You may extend and ask other questions as
            well. We recommend completing the retell activity before July 12th to ensure you have
            the information you are hoping for and give you time to write up your learnings.
Part II: Phonemic Awareness and Book Handling (10 points)
        (due July 18 on Canvas)
        • You will need to complete 2 separate assessments with your buddy before July 18th.
            We recommend doing it early in the week so that you have time to continue if needed
            or add more.
        • The write up template is on Canvas.
Part III: Letter to your Buddies (10 points)
        (due July 21 on Canvas)

            prefer.
        •   Templates can be found on Canvas.
Presentation
This is your final exam for the course. You will be asked to conceptualize assessment and its
relationship to a developmental perspective on reading acquisition through your work in
Longhorn Buddies. You will also be asked to connect your thinking to big ideas that we have
covered in the course.
You will participate in a small group (~3-4 people). Each person will individually present their
work. Students may earn up to 5 points based on the quality of their presentation.
Given that this will be on the second to last day of class, and before the written synthesis (Part V)
is due, please use the template to prepare your presentation, but also listen carefully for feedback
from your peers as well as Heather and Erica to continue to workshop your synthesis. This is
meant to scaffold and support you to write up Part V.
Part V: Case Study Synthesis (15 points)
        (due July 23)
This is a write up of the presentation you share with your classmates. Using your PPT as a
starting place you will write up the same categories as you included on the presentation but in
more detail to synthesize your learning about the Longhorn Buddy and reading, assessment, and
development.

How your work will be evaluated
Written work is graded on completion of expectations of the assignment, organization, and mechanics.
Letter grades have the following meaning for this course.
    ● An “A” signifies work of excellent quality--that demonstrates clarity of purpose, organization,
        and communication, and substantive and original interpretation of course material. “A” level
                                                                                                         8


                                                                                        EDC s339D/Unique: 74330
         participation need not solely mean a large quantity of participation but the student who prepares
         for class and consistently indicates having thought about the material including offering original
         and high-quality insights.
    ●    A “B” signifies work that meets expectations, meaning that all aspects of an assignment are
         completed, but the work lacks some aspects of “A” work, containing, for instance, less
         substantive effort towards the assignment, less effective organization, or less well articulated
         writing. In terms of class participation, a “B” signifies adequate, but not consistently strong,
         contributions to class.
    ●    A “C” for written work denotes poorly constructed, supported, or inconsistent argument, or work
         with poorly communicated meanings. A “C” for participation signifies a student who has missed
         classes and/or seems unprepared for class on several occasions (as demonstrated, for instance, by
         the quality of their contributions to class discussions).
Timeliness in submitting assignments
All assignments are due on their due date by the stated time on the syllabus. The grade for a late
assignment will be lowered by one half of a letter grade if the assignment is turned in after it is
due, on its due date. Another half letter grade will be lost for any additional day(s) for which an
assignment is late. This means it is not possible to turn in an assignment several days late and
earn a passing grade on that assignment. We will do our best to return graded assignments within
one weeks of receiving them.
Dress Code
Observe the professional dress code policies set forth by the Field Experiences Office for the
PDS, the school district, and the norms of the local school campus. Look tidy, but dress
comfortably enough that you can walk, bend, sit on the floor, etc. with a child.
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these
values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Documented Disability Statement
Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or 232-2937(Video Phone).
Faculty is not required to provide accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.
(Note to Faculty: Details of a student’s disability are confidential. Faculty should not ask questions
related to a student’s condition or diagnosis when receiving an official accommodation letter.)
Scholastic Dishonesty
Scholastic dishonesty includes any action that gives unfair advantage to one student over another. It
includes cheating, plagiarism, and altering grades and is taken seriously in this course and across campus.
Students are advised that any instance of scholastic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Students
for disposition.

Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date
of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a
project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed
work within a reasonable time after the absence. Students will not be penalized for absences due to the
observance of religious holidays that fall on our scheduled class day.
Absence for Military Service
In accordance with section 51.9111 of the Texas Education Code, a student is excused from attending
classes or engaging in other required activities, including exams, if he or she is called to active military
service of a reasonably brief duration. The maximum time for which the student may be excused has been
defined by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board as “no more than 25 percent of the total
number of class meetings or the contact hour equivalent (not including the final examination period) for
the specific course or courses in which the student is currently enrolled at the beginning of the period of
active military service.” The student will be allowed a reasonable time after the absence to complete
assignments and take exams.
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a
fire alarm is activated, or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding
evacuation:
         ▪ Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the
             nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building. Do not use the
             escalator or elevators.
         ▪ If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
         ▪ In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the
Fire Prevention Services office gives you instructions.
