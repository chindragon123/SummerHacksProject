Course Description:
This course introduces a variety of advanced applications using the visual programming
environment Max (formerly known as Max/MSP, developed by Cycling ’74). Students will
refine a series modular patches that can be used to drive MIDI instruments or for live sound
processing. By the end of the course, students will be able to create performances, installations,
or improvisations using the computer, either in the planning stages or with live processing.
The course is divided into four phases. Phase one introduces tools for Computer-Assisted
Composition (CAC). Students will learn to integrate musical notation into the computer music
environment via the bach automated composer’s helper (http://www.bachproject.net/), a


                                                        Intermediate Computer Music / MUS 329M
flexible, list-based notation interface written for Max— a tool that allows the familiar and
intuitive interaction with notes on a staff to become a prominent feature of a patch. Students
will learn the basics of transforming abstract data into symbolic notation. The first assignment
involves creating a patch using bach that demonstrates a basic algorithmic composition,
creating a score from data or processes of the student’s choice. Concurrently, we will finish up
last semester’s Telematics collaboration with Mahidol University in Thailand, gearing up for
an informal performance on February 4th at 8 PM.
Phase two deals with sensors, along with a Max’s video engine Jitter. Students will learn how
to transform a stream of data (live-generated or fixed) into sonic material. Assignment number
two asks students to demonstrate a sonification of multiple data streams.
Unit three focuses on the concept of audio descriptors. Students will learn how to decipher
descriptor data for a range of applications, including concatenative synthesis with CataRT. One
week will de devoted to creative approaches to field recording.
The fourth phase presents a brief introduction to multiple other tools: pattr storage and
optimal patch organization, advanced synthesis technques, spatialization, and automated
orchestration.
The final exam will be in the form of an independent project in Max, geared to the level and
interests of each student, decided upon in consultation with and supervised by the professor
and/or teaching assistant. It is due May 7, 2019.
There is no textbook for the course; the only requirement is a Max student license. Max
(current version 8.1.1) is free for a 30-day trial. A student subscription valid for one year is
available for $59 at www.cycling74.com. The best resource for those who want to supplement
their knowledge, is Max’s own set of tutorials, included with the software.
PARTICIPATION: An alert and active presence is crucial to build the programming skills
necessary to succeed at this course.
EVALUATION:
Assignment 1: algorithmic etude — 20%
Assignment 2: data to sound patch — 20%
Assignment 3: field recording project — 20%
Final Project — 30%
Class Participation — 10%
Students must submit assignments by email, then come to class with assignments on their
computers (or already loaded onto the studio machine), and be prepared to present them in
class. Students are responsible for checking Canvas for updates, prompts, and deadlines.

                                UNIVERSITY RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS
Your success in this class is important. We will all need accommodations because we all learn differently. If
there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as
possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.
There are also a range of resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information
that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be
evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment for all
students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain
the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact Services for Students with Disabilities,
512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope
with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking
for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual
assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational
institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become
involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory
Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I
am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing,
discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX
related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone
for support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and resources, visit
titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu .
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and
Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the
nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building. Students requiring assistance in
evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re- enter a
building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at
Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
