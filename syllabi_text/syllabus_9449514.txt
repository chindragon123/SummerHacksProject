The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
toward peers and community. Cheating and plagiarism (using another person's words
or ideas without proper attribution) are serious academic offenses and may result in a
failing grade or expulsion from the university! If you are unsure about what
constitutes plagiarism or have questions about how to employ source material in your
papers, please consult with me. You may discuss your papers with your friends—and I
encourage you to do so—but remember that the work you submit must be your own. If
you have questions concerning these issues, please see the link to the University Honor

Instructions for the Presentation and Final Paper
Student Presentations
Each student will present a building designed by Adolf Loos or Ludwig Mies van der
Rohe. Sign-ups for the presentations will take place at the beginning of the semester.
Your presentation should be a building analysis (not a building history!), examining the
ideas behind the design, and the ways in which the specific concerns of these two
architects were realized. Please keep your analysis to no more than 15 minutes. DO NOT
read from notes, and make your presentation as interesting as possible.
Final Paper
Your final paper should explore some aspect of the work of Loos and/or Mies and/or of
their contemporaries. You may write an analysis of the building you have presented in
class, or you may choose another topic. Be sure to consult with me if you have any
questions.
Undergraduate papers should be approximately 12-15 pages in length, excluding notes,
graduate student papers, approximately 15-25 pages. You may include photographs,
drawings and other forms of documentation, but these should not be counted in your
page total. Papers should include a bibliography of all of the works you have consulted
as well as footnotes.
Please consult with me if you have any questions.
