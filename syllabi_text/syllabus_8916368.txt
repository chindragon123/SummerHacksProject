Health-care professionals, bio-medical researchers, patients, and families in all societies
have come to increasingly be faced with ethical issues that arise with the development of
new medical technologies as well as awareness of alternative approaches to thinking
about health and illness. This course focuses on ethical questions related to topics such as
allocation of medical resources, stem cell research and cloning, organ transplantation,
abortion, human experimentation, prolonging life and the right to die, suicide, euthanasia,
and diagnosis and treatment of illnesses such as Alzheimer disease, AIDS, and mental
disorders. We will explore these topics from a global perspective, emphasizing how
cultural values inform ethical decision-making and how different ethical systems address
and define moral issues that arise in relation to medical care. We will consider ethical
theories that have been used in the West to consider medical practice and compare these
with approaches in non-Western cultures such as Japan and India. The course will
emphasize use of case studies to explore issues in medical ethics and to develop the
ability to apply ethical theories in ways sensitive to variations in cultural values.
Throughout the course we will discuss and debate difficult moral issues and it is likely
that members of the class will have different, and sometimes profoundly conflicting,
ideas about what is right and wrong. You should feel free to express and support your
position; this is an important component of the class. However, it is equally important
that all members of the class respect the opinions of others and listen to their arguments.

Exams: There will be two in-class exams in this course, and a final exam. Exams are a
combination of objective questions, short answers, and essays.
STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS
Grades are assigned as follows: 93-100 = A; 90 – 92 = A-, 88 – 89 = B+, 83 – 87 = B, 80 – 82 = B-; 78 –
79 = C+, 73 – 77 = C, 70 – 72 = C-; 68 – 70 = D+, 63 – 67 = D, 60 – 62 = D-; below 60 = F. This course
is not normally graded on a curve.
GRADING RUBRIC
Grade                 Expectations/Standards
A, A-                 The grade of A will be only given for exemplary work, while an A- is work that is close to
                      exemplary. The paper, presentation, or exam demonstrates a detailed understanding of the
                      topic and provides a creative and scholarly analysis of the issues. There is a clear thesis and
                      the thesis is well-supported. It is clearly written, without typographical errors, spelling
                      mistakes, or grammatical errors.
B+, B, B-             This grade will be given to an exam, presentation, or paper that presents material clearly,
                      shows a basic understanding of the topic and provides a clear analysis of the issues. It is well
                      written, but may have some typographical errors, spelling mistakes, or grammatical problems
                      (there are few, however). There is room for improvement in both presentation and
                      content/structure of the argument.
C+, C, C-             This grade will be given to a product that shows some problems in terms of understanding and
                      analyzing the materials. There are problems with writing, some typographical errors, spelling
                      mistakes, or grammatical problems. These are sufficient to hinder understanding of the
                      writing and argument. There are problems in the argument and its supporting data.
D+, D, D-             This is given when there are significant problems related to understanding and analysis of
                      materials. The argument is poorly presented or is very weak. There are major problems with
                      writing, presentation style, spelling, grammar, etc.
F                     This grade is given when there are extremely serious deficiencies related to understanding and
                      analysis of the topic at hand and there are major problems with writing, presentation style,
                      spelling, grammar, etc. The grade F indicates a very serious deficiency in the paper,
                      presentation, or exam.
A-/B+, B-/C+,         Grades such as A/B indicate a paper, presentation, or exam that is borderline. This means that
B/B+, etc.            the paper is between the two grades. An A-/B+ indicates the paper, presentation, exam, etc. is
                      closer to an A-; a B+/A- indicates it is closer to a B+.

Appealing Grades
It is important to understand that you earn your grades on assignments and that you earn
your final grade for the course—I do not assign grades to your work, rather, based upon
the quality of the work you turn in, I arrive at an opinion about the grade which you have
earned. The grade you earn is based upon the quality of the work you turn in—there are
no other criteria that are used to arrive at a grade.
Should you find that you disagree with me on a grade you receive for an assignment, you
have the option of appealing your grade. If you want to appeal your grade, you must
follow the steps below within two days of my returning the graded assignments. If you
are not in class to receive the returned assignment, you still have only two days from the
date that I return them—you do not have two days from the date that you receive your
graded assignment (once I have returned the assignment to the class, the clock is ticking).
Follow these directions—if you do not follow the directions, I may not be willing to
consider your appeal:
     •  Provide the original assignment with any comments I have written on it, including
        the grade given. Keep a copy for yourself.
     •  Include a written explanation of why you believe that you have earned a grade
        different from the one I believe you have earned. I will assume that you will be
        appealing for a higher grade, but should you want to lower your grade, you are
        welcome to appeal for that as well. The written explanation should be no more
        than two paragraphs in length—it must be typed (single space is fine). Part of the
        success of your appeal will be based upon the quality of your argument as to why
        the grade I believe you earned is not appropriate. In your argument, you must
        indicate the exact grade that you believe you earned and explain why you believe
        this to be the case.
             o Keep in mind that the amount of time or effort you put into an assignment
                 is not an adequate reason for changing a grade. If you spend four years
                 working on something and turn in a product of poor quality, you will still
                 receive a low grade. While there is no question that there is a correlation
                 between the amount of work and time you put into an assignment and the
                 grade you earn, as an instructor I cannot take into account how much
                 time/effort you put into the assignment beyond the evident quality of the
                 work you turn in. If you appeal your grade on the basis of the fact that
                 you put a lot of work into the assignment, do not expect to receive a
                 positive response. I may sympathize with you and will be more than
                 happy to discuss how you can improve the quality of your work; but I am
                 unlikely to change your grade.
             o Also keep in mind that asking me to “round up” a grade that is close to a
                 higher grade is not considered an acceptable appeal. You may appeal a
                 grade only when you believe that I have made an error in grading or have
                 been unfair in my conclusion about the grade you have earned.
Biomedicine, Ethics, and Culture                                                             3

             o NOTE: In the case of a simple error in calculating your grade, you do not
                need to go through the above process. Simply see me after class and point
                out the error.
    •   You may be asked to come to my office hours to discuss your appeal. If this
        happens, come prepared to discuss/debate your appeal and to support your
        argument.
    •   Should you wish to discuss an appeal prior to actually submitting it, you are
        welcome to do so during my next office hours following return of the assignment.
        To do this you need to make an appointment with me within two days of
        receiving the assignment; you will then have two days following our meeting to
        write your appeal.
    •   If you want to appeal your final grade, you must provide all original graded
        materials for the semester to the instructor within five days of grades being posted
        to the online grading system. All of the above apply to appeals of final grades;
        however, I may not be able to meet with you ahead of your appeal.
    •   Appealing a grade means that you are requesting that I re-evaluate your
        assignment(s) and the grade I believe you have earned. It is possible, although
        unlikely, that I will lower your grade if I feel that you have earned a grade which
        is lower than the one I original believed to be appropriate.
Ground Rules for the Course
    1. NO LOBBYING FOR INCREASES IN YOUR GRADES. I will not under any
        conditions entertain emails or other contacts that involve attempts to lobby for a
        grade. For example, if you calculate your final grade for the semester and it is a
        79.4, do not send me an email (or any other communication) trying to explain
        why you think you deserve a B-. If you disagree with your grade, you should go
        through the process of appeal outlined above.
    2. NO OFFERING PRESENTS TO THE PROFESSOR OR TA. Although I
        appreciate it when a student has enjoyed the class and wishes to thank me or my
        TA with a gift, the rules of the university forbid this, and I also do not wish to
        receive such presents as they represent a conflict of interest. Please do not offer
        any sort of present—including candy, baked goods, etc.—at any time prior to,
        during, of after the course has ended. Gifts brought to my office will be refused
        and gifts left in my mail box will be discarded.
    3. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND WHAT CONSTITUTES ACADEMIC
        INTEGRITY. You should to read and understand the academic dishonesty site
        provided by Student Judicial Services. This is your responsibility. The URL is
        http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint.php.
Policy on Examination and Assignment Schedule: Examinations are to be taken on
the assigned date and time and assignments are to be turned in on the assigned date.
    q   There will be no make-up exams in this class; if you miss an exam due date, you
        will receive a zero. If you turn in a paper late, it will receive the grade of zero.
Biomedicine, Ethics, and Culture                                                             4

    q   If an examination or other due date conflicts with a religious holiday, you must
        contact the instructor prior to that date to arrange an alternative date to take the
        exam. If you have some type of important event, and can prove it, I will be happy
        to discuss an alternate date and time for you to take your exam—discussing it
        does not necessarily mean that I will approve the change in exam dates. You
        must give at least five business days prior notice in order to receive an exception
        to an exam date.
    q   Emergencies will be handled on a case-by-case basis, but will require evidence
        that proves that you actually encountered a situation that prevented you from
        taking the exam or turning in the paper. Excuses such as being confused about
        the date of the exam or failing to wake-up early enough to make it to class on an
        exam day will most likely be met with laughter, will not be considered acceptable,
        and will receive a grade of zero.
    q   Have someone proofread all written materials that you submit to class both for
        typographical errors and also to help you with writing and developing your ideas.
POLICY ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
You are expected to adhere to university requirements on academic honesty and integrity.
Behaviors such as plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, copying of another student’s
work, or cheating on examinations in any form will be viewed as an offense against the
academic community and will be dealt with accordingly. If you are uncertain about what
constitutes academic integrity (for example, if you are uncertain about what constitutes
plagiarism), you can either meet with the instructor or visit the web site of Student
Judicial Services (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/). Note that use of more than one
iClicker by a student is considered cheating/academic dishonesty. If a student is caught
using another student’s iClicker, both students will be considered in violation of
university policy on academic honesty. In the event that a student is found engaging in
behavior that violates university policies on academic integrity, as stipulated by the office
of Student Judicial Services and in this syllabus, the student will receive the grade of F
for the course and will be reported to the office of Student Judicial Services, where
further disciplinary action may be taken. There will be no exceptions.
UNIVERSITY ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATION POLICY
All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student
notification policy. It is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to
changes in his or her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent
and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related communications,
recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-
mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this
policy and instructions for updating your e-mail address are available at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html.
In this course e-mail will be used as a means of communication with students. You will
be responsible for checking your e-mail regularly for class work and announcements.
Biomedicine, Ethics, and Culture                                                              5

POLICY ON LAPTOPS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY USAGE IN CLASS
You are encouraged to bring your laptop to class to use for taking notes. You also will
have opportunities in class to work in groups and having your laptop may facilitate the
ease of working together. However, I do not want you to surf the web or otherwise use
your computer for things not related to class while I am lecturing or when you are
working in groups. Aside from the fact that it is rude, it is distracting to other students
(particularly those behind you during lectures) and also distracts YOU from the lecture or
discussion. My lectures may be boring, but I still expect you to pay attention. Don’t
think that because I cannot see your screen, I don’t have any idea that you are surfing the
web. It is actually quite easy to tell when people are surfing the web simply by looking at
their faces. If I find that a student is not adhering to this policy, I will ask the student to
meet me during office hours to discuss an appropriate penalty. Expect a minimum of a
5% reduction in your final grade if you are caught using your laptop during class for
purposes unrelated to the course.
Please turn off your cell phone before coming to class, unless you don’t mind my
stopping class and asking you to answer a call while we all wait and listen (yes, I’ve done
it before).
Some students, particularly those for whom English is not their first language, may wish
to record lectures. You are welcome to do so.
DOCUMENTED DISABILITY POLICY
Students with disabilities who require special accommodations need to get a letter that
documents the disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the
Office of the Dean of Students (471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf
or hard of hearing). This letter should be presented to the instructor at the beginning of
the semester and accommodations needed should be discussed at that time. If you need
any sort of special accommodation for assignments, you need to give me at least five
business days notice so that we can work out what you need. See following website for
more information: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd/providing.php.
Office Hours
My office hours for this semester are listed at the beginning of this syllabus. I will
normally be in my office during those hours; however, I am often also in my office at
other times. You are free to visit my office at any time—you are not limited to visiting
during office hours. If the door is shut, just knock. If I am busy (with meetings, writing,
other work, etc.) outside of office hours, I will let you know or I won’t answer the door.
Biomedicine, Ethics, and Culture                                                                6

Tentative Schedule
This is a tentative schedule. The course is intended as an exploration of ideas and as a
means of developing critical thinking skills. It is unlikely that we will adhere precisely to
this schedule, as I want the class to head into areas of interest that may slow things down.
Keep up with the readings and lectures and you will be all set at exam times. If we get
far off of schedule, I will revamp it and post it to Canvas. Readings that are marked with
the symbol # are available on Canvas. Readings should be completed by Tuesday of
each week, with the exception of week 1.
