               INTRODUCTION TO KOREAN CULTURE AND HISTORY

Overview: This course is designed as an introductory overview of Korean history,
culture, and society from ancient times to the present. It aims also to encourage students
to locate their knowledge about Korea in relation to perspectives from other disciplines,
while thinking critically about how history, culture, and society are understood. This
class has no prerequisites.
         Note: some of you may have studied Korean history in middle or high school. Do
not let this make you complacent. To put it bluntly, knowing the facts and the standard
narrative of Korean history will not be enough if you can’t critically analyze perspectives
and interpretations. This is what separates college history from high school history.
         This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed
to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States.
         Class lectures will be supplemented with films, slides, and other visual materials.
You are responsible for material discussed in class, and you should take notes and secure
notes for any meetings you miss. I will post Powerpoint outlines, but these are NOT
substitutes for notes you yourself take.
Assignments/Grading: Your grade will be based on
         Reading/lecture comprehension questions (Canvas): 16% total
         1 map quiz (as noted on syllabus; 4% of total grade)
         2 tests during the term (20% of total grade each for a total of 40%)
         1 final exam (30% of total grade)
         2 short reaction papers (1-2 pp. or so each; 5% each for 10% total)
         My general assumption is that you will complete the readings for each date listed
on the syllabus prior to the class session in question and will attend lectures. After some
lectures—that is, on some Tuesdays and Thursdays—I will post on Canvas
comprehension questions pertaining to both reading and lecture content that will require a
short response, from a word or two to a few sentences. Responses to questions posed on
a Tuesday will be due by Friday (12 noon); those to questions posed on a Thursday will
be due by the following Tuesday (12 noon). Since the whole point is that you should be
reading along and coming to lecture (or getting class notes if you miss lecture), there will
be no makeups or extensions for these comprehension questions.
         Individual comprehensive questions will be given a grade of 1, ½. or 0 points. At
the end of the course, I will drop ONE low score for each student and will otherwise
                                               1


average these assignments and assign a weight as noted above to create a reading/lecture
comprehension questions grade.
         The map quiz is a distinct event. It will be administered on an assigned date early
in the term; you will have a review sheet in advance to prepare.
         The two tests during the term will involve ID (identification) questions requiring a
one paragraph response. A good answer will not only identify a given term, but explain
its significance in some depth (we will discuss this further in class). The final exam will
consist of both IDs and one or two essay questions. ID QUESTIONS USED ON
EXAMS WILL BE DRAWN FROM A LIST OF KEY CONCEPTS I WILL POST
APPROXIMATELY EACH WEEK, AND WILL BE BASED ON BOTH READINGS
AND LECTURE. If you use these posted documents as guides for study and preparation,
you should do fine on exams.
         The two tests during the term will be based only on a portion of the Key
Concepts. The final exam, however, is CUMULATIVE. Don’t be surprised come
December.
         Each of the two short reaction papers (assigned throughout the term; 1-2 pp. each)
will ask you briefly to consider a specific issue and present an argument. Grading will be
based on the quality of your argument, your ability to support it (where appropriate), and
your writing.
         These papers must be submitted to Canvas by the beginning of class on the date
indicated. Late papers will not be accepted without prior consultation. Likewise, I will
not accept email submissions without prior permission and a good reason. After papers
have been returned and grades posted, it is your responsibility to inform me if yours is
missing ASAP.
         I will make use of plus/minus grading. Generally, I regard averages >=92
(rounded) as an A, 89-91 as an A-, 87-88 as a B+, 82-86 as a B, and so on at equivalent
points down the scale.
Cell phones: Cell phones and other communication devices should be turned off or (if
you truly need to be in contact) set for silent/vibration mode. During exams, I will insist
that they be completely off. If you need to make or receive a call, please leave the room
before you begin talking. Don’t ask, just go. Likewise if you need to use the bathroom
(during exams, I will allow only one person to leave at a time, and without his/her
belongings). Please do not abuse this policy.
         Also, please do not be text messaging your friends during class. If I see your
hands fiddling beneath the desk, I will assume the worst.
Laptop computers in the classroom are likewise a growing issue in higher education
circles. They can be very useful in taking notes—many of you, I’m sure, type faster than
you write—but put to other uses they can be an immense distraction to you and others
around you. Let me put it this way: if I look, or if a TA looks, at your laptop screen
during class, I had better see note taking (rather than internet surfing, games, social
media, studying for another class, or catching up on reading you didn’t do). If not, you
will lose the privilege of using a computer in class for the rest of the term.
                                               2


During tests no electronics (beyond dumb wristwatches) will be permitted on your
desks. This, unfortunately, goes for electronic dictionaries as well.
University Notices and Policies

The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through
integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students
Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are responsible for
reading your email for university and course-related information and announcements. You are responsible to
keep the university informed about changes to your e-mail address. You should check your e-mail regularly
and frequently to stay current with university-related communications, some of which may be time-critical.
You can find UT Austin?s policies and instructions for updating your e-mail address at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
Documented Disability Statement
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. If you require special accommodations, you will need to obtain a letter
that documents your disability from Services for Studies with Disabilities. Present the letter to me at the
beginning of the semester so we can discuss the accommodations you need. No later than five business
days before an exam, you should remind me of any testing accommodations you will need. For more
information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 232-2937 (video phone) or
www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd.
Religious Holidays
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a
project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work
within a reasonable time after the absence.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line
to discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a
partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC),
the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call
512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire
alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding
evacuation:
      Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember
that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
      If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of
class.
      In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire
Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office
Readings: The reading load for this class is variable. Read intelligently. For some
people, studying Korea can present a morass of unfamiliar details. The reason I will give
you key concepts weekly is not only towards tests and exams, it is also to help you pick
out what is important while doing the reading to begin with.
           The following book has been ordered and is available at the Coop. A copy is also
on reserve at PCL. Please let the Coop (and me) know if a book that you need is out of
                                                          3


stock. I recommend that you buy relatively early in the term, since the Coop sometimes
returns books to their publishers on short notice:
        Seth, Michael, A Concise History of Korea: From Antiquity to the Present (ideally
        the second edition of 2016; the first edition of 2011 is acceptable and differs
        primarily in chapters 15-16).
        Seth has written several Korean history textbooks. This is a version with 16
overall chapters, 588 pages in my edition. Do not confuse it with his shorter volumes
covering only “premodern” or “modern” history, each of which cut this larger book in
half.
        Other readings (as well as course documents such as weekly lists of key concepts,
the map quiz review, etc.) will be placed on Canvas, which can be accessed via the
website courses.utexas.edu with your UT EID and password. These are .pdf copies of
articles and the like; you can read them on screen or (my recommendation) print them so
you can mark them up.
