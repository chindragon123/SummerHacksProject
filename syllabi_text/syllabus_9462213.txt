                                        Course Description
This class focuses exclusively on sports from a business and legal perspective. Other segments
of the entertainment industry are not covered. The course has a business focus and incorporates
the most important legal developments that have shaped the sports industry, including labor law,
anti-trust law, intellectual property law, contract law, and gender law as well as the systems of
self-regulation created by teams, leagues, conferences, governing bodies, and player
associations.
Upon completion of this course, students should be able use the comprehensive economic,
organizational, legal and political knowledge gained to be able to strategize on behalf of a variety
of sports industry stakeholders promoting particular self-interests, often in conflict with other
industry stakeholders.
Of particular focus will be developing the ability to maneuver through a constantly changing
sports industry environment, impacted by issues such as labor relations, changes in sports
gambling regulations, concussion treatment and prevention, changes in media technology,
advances in sports analytics, franchise expansion and relocation, college conference realignment
and controversial practices of sports equipment companies impacting college recruitment.
The successful learner will be in an enhanced position to navigate within the sports business and
media context in a variety of roles.

     interest.
 -   Working as a sports agent
 -   Working in sports media as a journalist, producer, programmer, or in sports media sales


-   Working for a sports or non-sports corporate brand or agency evaluating sports marketing
    strategies that may include advertising, sponsorship or endorsement
-   A professional athlete seeking to leverage his/her highest value
-   A life-long sports fan who wants to understand the off the field forces that impact how
    sports are organized and presented.
-   The casual or non-sports fan curious about why the sports industry attracts so much
    investment from fans, sponsors, advertisers and media
Some primary skills and attitudes to be developed
- An understanding that sports is a business with nuance and complexity equal to anything
    created on the field
- The ability within this space, to think critically, analyze situations, consider creative
    negotiation options and use empathy to understand the self-interest perspective of other
    stakeholders.
Learning outcomes:

Class Prep Discussions/Quizzes Timing Grading
Up to twenty Class Prep assignments, often in the form of Canvas Discussions or Quizzes will be
assigned to prepare you for class discussions. If an amount other than twenty of these
assignments is ultimately given, then number actually assigned will be awarded points on a pro-
rated basis to total the 200 available points .
The schedule calls for relevant readings to be completed prior to class each Monday. Discussion
and Quiz assignments are normally due at 5 pm on the Tuesday of a given week a particular


Comments you make on other students work should be done before 9pm on that Tuesday. This
timing will allow time for students to comment on each other’s responses and for me review
submissions and incorporate them into the class session. If it appears that assigned content is not
being read by Monday, we will revert to all reading and assignments due on Monday.

Point of View Papers.
These may be assigned as in class or out of class work. These are an opportunity to display
higher level thinking and apply principles discussed.
Attendance Grading
Attendance is required for all class meetings and contributes a potential of 4 points to your final grade. In class
assignments will get a score of zero in the case of unexcused absences. For each unexcused absence after the
second instance, a student will lose one of the available 4 attendance points. An excused absence is defined as a
documented illness, documented University-related absence (sports team travel) and religious holidays (prior
notification required). Excused absence for illness requires health provider documentation.
Attendance Recording
Attendance is recorded and maintained in the required free Arkaive app. You are required to purchase the
feature that allows you to keep up with your attendance records. Discrepancies must be reported to the TA
within a week of the recorded absence in question. Though we often remind students to check in to
Arkaive as class begins, the responsibility to check in rests solely with the student. Lack of a reminder is
not an excuse for not checking in. The time window to check in to Arkaive may vary throughout the
semester at the Instructor or TA’s discretion.
Class Participation Grading
Class participation is essential and ranks at the top of factors students use to define a valuable course. Class
participation forms part of your grade in this class. Credit for the 6 available participation points is based on your
verbal in class participation as judged by the instructor and TA. To insure you receive full credit, you are
encouraged to turn in at least 3 Participation 3x5 Note Cards (student should have a supply with them in class)
at the end of the class in which they participated.
Cards are to include name, EID, the topic they contributed to and a description of the
contribution. Two points will be awarded for each appropriately completed and accepted card up to the 6 point max.

Late Work
All late work runs the risk of most likely earning none of the available points for the assignment.


Exceptions will only be made under extreme circumstances. If you turn work in late, do not expect to
earn points on it.
Electronic Devices Subject to Banishment
Devices will be allowed as we begin the semester but are subject to being banned if non class use is
significant and persistent. Don’t be the person who contributes to this action being taken. A lack of
involvement in class discussion is the first tell-tale sign that the experts are right. None of us can learn in
class and surf at the same time!
Classroom Behavioral Expectations
Any behavior that erodes the experience of other students will be grounds for a student being removed
from that class. A pattern of such behavior, including repeatedly showing up late for class or leaving
early, lack of participation or preparation, inappropriate use of electronic devices and visible non-
engagement, inappropriate talking, etc. will be grounds for the student being dropped from the class.
Course Instructor Survey
Participation in the end of semester Course Instructor Survey is mandatory
University Policies
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As
a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the
University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT.
Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in
previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and
subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible
for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be
found at the following web address:http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Qdrop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are
only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more
information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop

Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual
harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally
funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working
environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our
community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm
or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or
“Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the
Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents
that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty
or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible
employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official
report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting
options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at
titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety
and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
assembling outside.
• Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember
that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
• Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
week of class.
• In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter
a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of
Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
• Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be
