     (1) Introduction to BIM
     (2) Model-based Cost Estimating
     (3) Construction Scheduling and 4D Simulation
     (4) Design Coordination
     (5) BIM to the Field
SOFTWARE DEMONSTRATIONS:
In-class demonstrations of software tools will be presented. They are intended to provide students with first
introductions to the tools and give them a “jump start”, not to fully train students on the use of tools. Students will
require self-study before they will be able to work effectively with the tools
GRADING:
Grade components will be weighted as follows in the computation of the final course grade:
     For CE 395 R7                                                   For ARE 376
     Participation                  10% (instructor’s discretion)    Participation                 10% (instructor’s discretion)
     Case Study                     10%                              Case Study                    15%
     Quizzes                        20% (individual weights vary)    Quizzes                       30% (individual weights vary)
     Homework Assignments           40% (individual weights vary)    Homework Assignments          45% (individual weights vary)
     Synthesis Report               20%
The correspondence of letter grade to numerical grade is:
                    A:        grade ≥ 93
                    A-:       90 ≤ grade < 93
                    B+:       87 ≤ grade < 90
                    B:       83 ≤ grade < 87
                    B-:      80 ≤ grade < 83
                    C+:      77 ≤ grade < 80
                    C:       73 ≤ grade < 77
                    C-:      70 ≤ grade < 73
                    D+:      67 ≤ grade < 70
                    D:       63 ≤ grade < 67
                    D-:      60 ≤ grade < 63
                    F:       grade < 60
As the plus/minus system allows fairer grading, assigned grades will strictly follow calculated scores.
Fall 2019                                                                                                               2


GRADE DISPUTES:
Your grades will be posted on Canvas and you should check there often to make sure that the posted scores are
correct. Any grade disputes need to be made in written to the instructor up to 5 calendar days after the date the
graded material has been returned in class or posted on Canvas (whichever occurred first), regardless of whether the
student in question was present in class or not. No dispute will be accepted after the deadline.
COURSE/INSTRUCTOR EVALUATIONS:
An evaluation of the course and instructor will be conducted at the end of the semester using the approved UT
Course/Instructor evaluation forms.
POLICIES:
Assignments:
The student is responsible for all reading assignments and class handouts whether or not covered in class or listed on
the syllabus. All assignments are due at the beginning of the period assigned and those turned in late will count
off 10% per day (no exceptions!). Late period begins 10 minutes after class start time (e.g., if class starts at 9:30am,
any assignment turned in after 9:40am is considered late). My goal is to return all graded assignments to students
within two course-weeks from the date submitted. For all group assignments, peer evaluations may be
conducted and grades for each individual team member will be proportional to their peer assessments.
Quizzes:
Quizzes are closed book, closed note evaluation. Quizzes will cover part of the class material (subjects will be
announced in class), assigned readings and guest lectures. Quizzes may include problems, definition/matching,
multiple choice, and short answer questions as appropriate to the material covered.
Class Participation and Attendance:
Class participation grades are based on the instructor’s perception of student interaction and active participation in
the classroom. It is important that you are familiar with the course material as the course evolves. Your ability to
answer questions and discuss the material will be part of the overall participation evaluation. Therefore, you should
review class material ahead of time. Regular attendance is expected and encouraged. Your attendance will be used to
evaluate your participation grade. I consider a student missing more than one week of class without excuse to be a
serious participation problem. In some cases, I will petition the Office of Student Affairs to drop students from the
course who have excessive absences and may withhold the entire participation grade at my discretion for
participation problems. Each student is responsible for all material and administrative instructions given during the
lecture period.
Personal Problems:
If you have illness or personal problems that will affect your performance during the course of the semester, please
let me know as soon as possible. “After the fact” provides little protection unless there are extreme circumstances. I
have an answering machine, a fax machine, and an e-mail address if you need to get in touch with me after hours.
Do not hesitate to use them.
Scholastic Dishonesty:
IMPORTANT! Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the
individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.

Privacy – Web Based Class Sites:
Web-based, password-protected class sites may be associated with all academic courses taught at the University.
Syllabi, handouts, assignments and other resources are types of information that may be available within these sites.
Site activities could include exchanging email, engaging in class discussions and chats, and exchanging files. In
addition, electronic class rosters will be a component of the sites. Students who do not want their names included in
these electronic class rosters must restrict their directory information in the Office of the Registrar, Main Building,
Room 1. For information on restricting directory information, see:
https://registrar.utexas.edu/students/records/restrictmyinfo.
Dropping the Class:
Undergraduate Students: From the 1st through the 12th class day, an undergraduate student can drop a course via
the web and receive a refund, if eligible. From the 13th class day through the university’s academic drop deadline,
a student may Q drop a course with approval from the Dean, and departmental advisor.
Graduate Students: From the 1st through the 4th class day, graduate students can drop a course via the web and
receive a refund. During the 5th through 12th class day, graduate students must initiate drops in the department that
offers the course and receive a refund. After the 12th class day, no refund is given. No class can be added after the
12th class day. From the 13th through the 20th class day, an automatic Q is assigned with approval from the
Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. From the 21st class day through the last class day, graduate students can
drop a class with permission from the instructor, Graduate Advisor, and the Graduate Dean. Students with 20-
hr/week GRA/TA appointment or a fellowship may not drop below 9 hours.
Computer Usage:
Students are expected to be proficient on a personal computer and to be able to use word processing and spreadsheet
programs such as Word and Excel. Familiarity with the Civil Engineering Learning Resources Center (LRC) is
assumed. The web-based UT Canvas system will be used extensively to coordinate class assignments and
disseminate course information, including class notes.
IMPORTANT DATES:
No classes on November 28 due to Thanksgiving. September 13 is the last day to drop a class for a possible refund.
November 25 is the last day a graduate student can change the course to/from credit/no credit. October 31 is the last
day an undergraduate student may, with the dean’s approval, withdraw from the University or drop a class except
for urgent and substantiated, nonacademic reasons. October 31 is the last day an undergraduate student may change
registration in a class to or from the pass/fail basis. December 9 is the last day a graduate student may, with the
approval of the instructor, the graduate adviser, and the graduate dean, drop a course.
