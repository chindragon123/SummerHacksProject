Note: This is an ambitious plan! The schedule planned here is a guide and
may change during the course of the semester. I will do my best to keep up
and follow this plan. Each semester is different based on the number of
students and / or pace of our class. Thus, we may need to adjust our plans
accordingly. Any changes to this plan would be announced in class and also
would be noted to all the students on Canvas.
