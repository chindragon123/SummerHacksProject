I. Rationale:
This course simulates the production pipeline of a 3-D digital art studio; Manifesting creative ideas into tangible
reality via 3D modeling, texturing, rigging, animation, lighting, rendering, and interactivity.
II. Course Aims and Objectives:
Aims
This course teaches students to manifest ideas from thought to tangible reality in a digital space. This course
consists of projects focused on the creation of animated 3-D characters and objects, to virtual game environments.
In this semester-long exploration of 3-D digital artistry, one will be able to try on all aspects of the production
pipeline to see which best suits them. Digital production art 3D is an action packed and fun filled sampler of the
exciting world of creating 3D graphics and the myriad potential therein.
Specific Learning Objectives:
By the end of this course, students will:
          •   Understand the similarities and differences between producing animation for a 3-D game versus film
          •   Conceptualize characters and environments in both form and function
          •   Create character and environment designs in the form of 3-D digital models
          •   Comprehend the process of rigging, or character setup
          •   Explore texture through multiple approaches to surfacing digital models
          •   Apply 3-D character animation for use in both rendered video as well as real time game
              environments
          •   Evaluate the relationship between art history and its relationship to the current state of 3 -D digital art
          •   Create a most specific creative 3D project, utilizing the entire 3D production pipeline, for bo th
              maximum efficiency and maximum output possibilities.
                                        Project(s) intended to prove a thorough understanding of 3D production process
                                                                                   in order to dissolve boundaries between

III. Format and Procedures:
This course will meet twice a week. During the first meeting, there will be a lecture that will include demonstration
along with discussion. During the second meeting of the week, there will be group learning project with discussion.
The in-class projects will review and practice the material covered from the week’s first class meeting. Active
participation in weekly in-class group projects will be a major component of the professionalism and participation
component of student grades for the course that will comprise 20% of the final grade.

Feedback Statement (to encourage students to respond to your requests for their feedback)
During this course I will be asking you to give me feedback on your learning in informal as well as formal ways,
including through anonymous surveys about how my teaching strategies are hel ping or hindering your learning. It’s
very important for me to know your reaction to what we’re doing in class, so I encourage you to respond to these
surveys, ensuring that together we can create an environment effective for teaching and learning.
V. My Assumptions
It is my belief that with hard work and a little bit of patience, anyone can be good at 3 -D digital art. The learning
curve is slower for some than others, but do not be discouraged and you will get to where you wan t to be. With the
projects we create in this course, I advise students to make something that they can get really excited about. Think
about making short-term goals for your progress, and try to learn a new skill each day. The 3 -D digital art process is
very iterative, in that projects build upon one another, and many steps are repeated ad infinitum. With a firm plan in
place, it will be easy to create a road map for success.
VI. Course Requirements:
          1. Class attendance and participation policy:
                    (a) Expected classroom behavior: take notes, ask many questions, and attend class for the entire
                         duration. Make a solid effort on each project outside of class, so that you may have many
                         questions to contribute to the discussion.
                    (b) Cell phone use, including texting, is unallowable. Keep cell phones stored during the duration
                         of class
                    Religious Holy Days
                    By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
                    the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an exam ination, a work
                    assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to
                    complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
          2. Course Readings/Materials:
                    Recommended Textbooks:
                    (a) Introducing Autodesk Maya 2018: Autodesk Official Press, by Dariush Derakhshani. 1 st
                         Edition. ISBN: 9781119059639
                    (b) Unity in Action: MultiplatformGame Development in C#,
                    By Joseph Hocking. ISBN: 9781617292323
                    (c)Cartoon Animation, by Preston Blair. ISBN: 9781560100843
                    (b) Supplies needed: Laptop computer capable of running Autodesk Maya and Unity.
                    (c) Other supplies: Jump Drive for external storage and data backup. A mouse for your laptop, as
                    the 3D software will be much slower to use without one.
                    (d) To download free student version of Maya and Unity:

                    (f) Sketchfab.com → create an account for your class process blog
          3. Assignments, Assessment, and Evaluation
                     (a) Finished Assignments should be posted to canvas in the requested format before 9:00 AM on
                            the Due Date
                     (b) Late assignments will be lose 10 points for the first day late, 20 points if 2 days late, 40
                            points off if 3 days late, and so on, with point subtraction doubling for each day of lateness
                                                               33


(c) Preliminary information on papers or projects, with due dates, shall be posted to canvas on
      the date of assignment
                                      33


                       (d) List of assignments that will impact the final grade: (projects include presentation component)

                       aspect of the 3D digital production ART pipeline, and builds upon the last, culminating in a
                       finished multimedia work. (optimized for future output)
                       (f) Any changes in the syllabus, such as project due dates, will be announced in class as well as
                       on canvas.
              4. Use of Canvas in class
                     In this class I use Canvas—a Web-based course management system with password-protected
                     access at http://canvas.utexas.edu —to distribute course materials, to communicate and collaborate
                     online, to post grades, and to submit assignments. You can find support in using Canvas at the ITS
                     Help Desk at 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., so plan accordingly.

     ▪▪   Please notify me as early in the semester as possible if disability-related accommodations for field trips are
          required. Advanced notice will permit the arrangement of accommodations on the given day (e.g.,

Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six (6). As
stated in Senate Bill 1231:
          “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not per mit an
   undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has
   dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than
   that number.”
Emergency Evacuation Policy
 Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm
 is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
          ▪▪ Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest
               exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
          ▪▪ If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
          ▪▪ In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police
Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
