                                                                                            13
Attendance and active participation:
Your presence will be recorded0 at the beginning of each class. Unsatisfactory
attendance unsupported by medical documentation will preclude a student’s receiving a
grade higher than C. Active participation means being involved in discussions and
discussion groups, being curious and asking questions in the event you don’t understand
something, questioning statements and findings with which you disagree, and defending
your own findings and opinions, according to your own capacity to perform in a group. It
also means doing your homework regularly (being prepared for class). Finally,
disagreement with the instructor is strongly encouraged.
Additional shorter written assignments or quizzes may be assigned in the course of the
semester.
You will receive grading credit for such assignments.
For each class, please bring a hard copy of the essential course readings or a screen
version that is easily usable.
The Writing Centre offers support and help for student writing and research:
http://uwc.utexas.edu
Attendance at the Writing Center is NOT a substitute for my working with you on
your writing and research skills. It is an additional investment in your writing.
Additional Information / Rules of Conduct

                                                                                           14
See: <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/assistive/policy.html> for requesting help you
need in using the main library (PCL) or the Fine Arts Library (for films).
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
The University of Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean
of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY. Any student with a documented disability who
requires academic accommodations should contact the Service for Students with
Disabilities as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized
accommodations. These letters must be given to your TAs to receive accommodations.
See: <http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/index.php>.
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS AND OTHER ABSENCES
Students can make up work missed because of a religious holiday as long as they provide
the instructor with documentation at least one week before the holiday occurs. The same
applies to official university obligations like Club or Varsity sports. Documentation from
a physician is required for medical absence; arrangements for work to be made up must be
made promptly, and in no case should the work be completed more than 2 weeks after the
absence. Other absences (e.g. family events) must be arranged for IN ADVANCE and
missed work must be turned in at the NEXT CLASS SESSION upon return.
CHEATING AND PLAGIARISM
Cheating and other forms of scholastic dishonesty, including plagiarism, will be reported
to the Dean of Students. Cheating on tests or plagiarism on papers is an F for the assignment,
with no makeup possible. If you engage in any form of scholastic dishonesty more than
once, you will receive an automatic F for the course. If you are unsure about the exact
definition of scholastic dishonesty, you should consult the information about academic
integrity produced by the Dean of Students Office:
<http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php>.__
Plagiarism means using words or ideas that are not your own without citing your sources
and without indicating explicitly what you have taken from those sources. If you are unsure
about what constitutes plagiarism, consult:
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/plagiarism/>
What does “citing your sources” mean? It means providing appropriate footnotes and
bibliographic entries.
See <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/services/instruction/learningmodules/citations/>.
To make correct citations, researchers often use bibliographic software like UT’s
“Noodlebib” <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/noodlebib/> or Zotero <http://www.zotero.com.
