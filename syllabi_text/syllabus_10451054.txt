V. Course Requirements -both Undergraduate and Graduate Students will
complete requirements #1-4. Graduate students only - will complete
requirement #5.
1. Family of Origin (FOO) Movie Review Paper
Goal – the goal of this assignment has two main purposes; to help you understand how SUD
affects the family, and how SUD in the family can have long lasting effects on both an individual
and the family. Outside of class, no later than June 23rd you will watch the movie Saving Mr.
Banks. Watch through your therapeutic lens. Using the plethora of clinical indications in the
movie, record and discuss what stands out for you. Here are some questions that will help
guide the process.
     • How does someone’s family of origin (specifically with SUD) affect their ability to adjust
        in adult life? Consider;
            o Relationships
            o The color red
            o Pears
            o Fun
            o Kids
     • When working with alcoholics and addicts how much do you think someone’s FOO
        might be something that you will work with?
     • Why did Pamela need to push everyone away? Was Ralph an exception, why?
     • What are some of the cultural aspects of this movie? How do they influence addiction?
     • What did the progression of Travers Goff’s addiction look like?
     • Identify the various potential for trauma in this family.
When you have finished the movie, complete a 3-5-page paper discussing your thoughts. You
may use some of the above questions as writing points, but you are not limited to them. Also,
make sure to include at the end of your paper, the impact of this assignment on your self-
awareness. What did you learn about yourself and your FOO from watching the movie? What
areas might you need to monitor so that your experiences do not get in the way of what your
client’s and/or families need? Be reflective!
The paper must adhere to APA guidelines (with the exception of the self-reflection portion).
It should also be carefully edited for organization, spelling, grammar, punctuation, and clarity of
thought. Due anytime between June 16th – June 23rd, it must be posted on Canvas no later
than 12pm June 23rd.
Please Note: Reflecting on your family of origin can sometimes be difficult. Issues may arise
that cause thoughtfulness, pain or questioning. Please remember that all families ebb and flow
between unhealthy and healthy periods. This is central to our human condition. One of the
goals of this assignment is to help provide insight into your own family dynamics and emotional
system so you can better use and monitor your experiences in your work/practice. The
                                                                                                  3

VIII. University Policies
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HONOR CODE. The core values of The University of Texas at Austin
are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each
member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust,
fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND CIVILITY IN THE CLASSROOM. The professor expects students
to act as professionals in class. This means students should arrive on time for class, be prepared
to participate in the class discussion, and show respect for one another’s opinions. A course
brings together a group of diverse individuals with various backgrounds. Students are
influenced and shaped by such factors as race, ethnicity, gender, sex, physical abilities, religious
and political beliefs, national origins, and sexual orientations, among others. We expect to learn
from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. This
atmosphere includes working intentionally to recognize and dismantle racism, sexism,
heterosexism, and ableism in the classroom. Social Work also deals with complex and
controversial issues. These issues may be challenging and uncomfortable, and it would be
impossible to offer a substantive classroom experience that did not include potentially difficult
conversations relating to challenging issues. In this environment, we will be exposed to diverse
ideas and opinions, and sometimes we will not agree with the ideas expressed by others.
Nevertheless, the professor requires that students engage one another with civility, respect,
and professionalism.
UNANTICIPATED DISTRESS. Students may experience unexpected and/or distressing reactions
to course readings, videos, conversations, and assignments. If so, students are encouraged to
inform the professor. The professor can be responsive and supportive regarding students’
participation in course assignments and activities, but students are responsible for
communicating clearly what kind of support is desired. If counseling is needed, students may
contact a service provider of their choosing, including the UT Counseling Center at 512-471-
3515 or online at https://cmhc.utexas.edu/.
                                                                                                   6


POLICY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION. Public social networks are
not private. Even when open only to approved or invited members, users cannot be certain that
privacy will exist among the general membership of sites. If social work students choose to
participate in such forums, please assume that anything posted can be seen, read, and
critiqued. What is said, posted, linked to, commented on, uploaded, subscribed to, etc., can be
accessed and archived, posing potential harm to professional reputations and prospective
careers.
Social work students who use social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and other forms
of electronic communication (e.g. blogs) must be mindful of how their communication may be
perceived by clients, colleagues, faculty, and others. Social work students are expected to make
every effort to minimize material which could be considered inappropriate for a professional
social worker in training. Because of this, social work students are advised to manage security
settings at their most private levels and avoid posting information/photos or using any
language that could jeopardize their professional image.
Students are asked to consider the amount of personal information posted on these sites and
are obliged to block any client access to involvement in the students’ social networks. Client
material should not be referred to in any form of electronic media, including any information
that might lead to the identification of a client or compromise client confidentiality in any way.
Additionally, students must critically evaluate any material that is posted regarding community
agencies and professional relationships, as certain material could violate the standards set by
the School of Social Work, the Texas Code of Conduct for Social Workers, and/or the NASW
Code of Ethics.
Social work students should consider that they will be representing professional social work
practice as well as The University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work program while in the
classroom, the university community, and the broader area communities.
POLICY ON SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY. Students who violate University rules on scholastic
dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course
and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students,
and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For
further information, the student may refer to the Web Site of the Student Judicial Services,
Office of the Dean of Students: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/.
USE OF COURSE MATERIALS. The materials used in this course, including, but not limited to
exams, quizzes, and homework assignments, are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized
duplication of the course materials is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary
action being taken against the student. Additionally, the sharing of course materials without the
specific, express approval of the professor may be a violation of the University’s Student Honor
Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action. This
sharing includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for the purpose of
distributing those materials to other current or future students.
                                                                                                     7


DOCUMENTED DISABILITY STATEMENT. Any student who requires special accommodations
must obtain a letter that documents the disability from the Services for Students with
Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement (471- 6259 voice or
471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). A student should present the letter to
the professor at the beginning of the semester so that needed accommodations can be
discussed and followed. The student should remind the professor of any testing
accommodations no later than five business days before an exam. For more information,
visit: http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/.
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS. By UT Austin policy, students must notify the professor of a pending
absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If the
student must miss a class, examination, work assignment, or project in order to observe a
religious holy day, the professor will give the student an opportunity to complete the missed
work within a reasonable time after the absence.
TITLE IX REPORTING. In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the
University of Texas at Austin is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is free
from discriminatory conduct on the basis of sex https://titleix.utexas.edu/. Faculty, field
instructors, staff, and/or teaching assistants in their supervisory roles are mandated reporters
of incidents of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual violence, stalking, dating violence,
or any other forms of sexual misconduct. Students who report such incidents will be informed
of University resources. Incidents will be reported to the University’s Title IX Coordinator.
Further information, including student resources related to Title IX, may also be found at
https://titleix.utexas.edu/.
CAMPUS CARRY POLICY. The University’s policy on concealed firearms may be found here:
https://campuscarry.utexas.edu. You also may find this information by accessing the Quick Links menu
on the School’s website.
CLASSROOM CONFIDENTIALITY. Information shared in class about agencies, clients, and personal
matters is considered confidential per the NASW Code of Ethics on educational supervision and is
protected by regulations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) as well. As such,
sharing this information with individuals outside of the educational context is not permitted. Violations
of confidentiality could result in actions taken according to the policies and procedure for review of
academic performance located in sections 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 of the Standards for Social Work Education.
USE OF E-MAIL FOR OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE TO STUDENTS. Email is recognized as an
official mode of university correspondence; therefore, students are responsible for reading
their email for university and course-related information and announcements. Students are
responsible for keeping the university informed about a change of e-mail address. Students
should check their e-mail regularly and frequently—daily, but at minimum twice a week—to
stay current with university-related communications, some of which may be time-sensitive.
                                                                                                          8


Students can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating their e-mail address
at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
SAFETY. As part of professional social work education, students may have assignments that
involve working in agency settings and/or the community. As such, these assignments may
present some risks. Sound choices and caution may lower risks inherent to the profession. It is
the student's responsibility to be aware of and adhere to policies and practices related to
agency and/or community safety. Students should notify the professor regarding any safety
concerns
BEHAVIOR CONCERNS ADVICE LINE (BCAL). If students have concerns about their behavioral
health, or if they are concerned about the behavioral health of someone else, students may use
the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone their concerns. This service is provided
through a partnership between the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental
Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas
Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
EMERGENCY EVACUATION POLICY. Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are
required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement
is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
    · Familiarize yourself with all exit doors in the classroom and the building. Remember that
        the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
    · If you require assistance to evacuate, inform the professor in writing during the first
        week of class.
    · In the event of an evacuation, follow the professor’s instructions.
