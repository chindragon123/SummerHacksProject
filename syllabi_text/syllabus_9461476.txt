REQUIRED MATERIAL
    • Perfect Pitch: The Art of Selling Ideas and Winning New Business
        By: Jon Steel
        ISBN: 978-0471789765
        Publisher: Jon Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2006
COURSE DESCRIPTION
This class is the Capstone Class for the undergraduate Advertising and Public Relations
programs. The major focus of this course is on the development of a campaign for a
client. The class doesn’t focus on the development of new skills. Instead, it is about the
refinement, integration and implementation of what you have already learned.
In addition to the development of a communications campaign, the course is a mixture
of lectures, in-class discussions, assignments, exams and required readings.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
    • Provide students with an in-depth understanding of the process of planning,
        presenting and implementing a communications campaign. For this to happen,
        the emphasis in the course is on each individual learning-by-doing. That is, by
        developing and presenting a complete campaign for a real client.
    •   Increase students’ level of competence and professionalism by helping them
        sharpen the following skills: strategic and critical thinking; planning;
        organizational, written, verbal and visual communication; time management;


        interpersonal and task group (bringing out the best in others).
STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES
I expect each of you to be responsible individuals. As such, you must:
•       Meet strict deadlines and solve sometimes ambiguous problems;
•       Sell your ideas and defend your opinions/recommendations;
•       Work closely and respectfully with others;
•       Demonstrate creativity, enthusiasm and hard work; and
•       Present yourself and your work in a highly professional manner.
CLASS ATTENDANCE & COMMUNICATION
Given the nature of this course, we won’t meet as a class very often. Therefore,
attendance is not mandatory (i.e., no roll taking). With that said, to be successful in this
course (and in life), you need to show up. You need to attend all classes, presentations
and account team meetings.
If you miss a class for whatever reason, you are responsible for finding out what
happened in that class. Don’t email me asking me to summarize the discussion you
missed. Check with a classmate for notes.
I will communicate with you outside of class through email. You are
responsible for checking your email on a regular basis and are responsible for the
content of those emails. Failure to check your email does not excuse you from meeting
the responsibilities outlined in the message.
Conversely, email is an excellent way for you to communicate with me. I will respond to
your email within 24 hours of receiving it on weekdays or by Monday evening if I receive
it on the weekend. Many times I will email you back much faster.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS
The Syllabus, Course Calendar, Assignment Memos and other materials will be posted
on Canvas. You will submit assignments on Canvas.
The schedule is tentative and can change, especially since you’ll be working with a real
client. You are responsible for all changes to the schedule as announced in class and/or
on Canvas.
Team Work
As in industry, this class is primarily based around teamwork. Marketing
communications, to be effective, requires groups of people to work together toward a
unified goal. Within departments or agencies, people with varied areas of expertise (i.e.,
media, creative, PR, account planning) must cooperate and act together to solve
problems. And, on a broader scale, the whole concept of “integrated” marketing
communication is about everyone – even those in other disciplines (i.e., sales
promotion, direct marketing) – working in a coherent manner so that they are not
creating incompatible solutions to a single problem.


In other words, like it or not, you will work in teams.
I will pick team leaders based on top résumés and cover letters. The leaders will then act
as management and pick their team. Once students have been assigned to a team, that’s
it. I will not adjust a team’s membership.
Teams will consist of varying personalities, skill sets and interests. You must find a way
to manage these differences. The ability to cooperate, communicate and work effectively
is critical, both in this class and in the real world.
Bottom line is that your team will sink or swim together.
Measure Individual Group Participation with a Structured Peer Evaluation System
Learning to write peer evaluations is a key skill. Early in your career you will be on the
receiving end of many such evaluations. Later, you will be required to assess the
professional performance of subordinates in measurable, precisely articulated, easily
understood terms. You will begin your understanding of this difficult management task
with this required assignment.
Client and Ownership
Our client has volunteered their time and assistance to contribute to the educational
goals of our School. All materials furnished by our client are to be treated as strictly
confidential, and to that end, each of you will sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement).
In addition, our client agrees to form a temporary client-agency relationship with the
class in the spirit of academic learning. As an incentive for volunteering, all materials
presented to the client automatically become their property.
Client Campaign
You will create one client campaign during this semester. In groups of four or five,
you and your teammates will work as an agency team to compete with other student
groups to win the account. You will pitch your campaign to the client on the date
indicated on the Course Calendar.
At that time a plansbook will also be due. You will give a physical copy of the plansbook
to me and another copy to the client. You will also submit a pdf copy on Canvas.
COURSE EVALUATION
As you come to the end of your college experience, I hope that you realize that it’s more
about what you learn, not what you earn, that really matters. I encourage you to “worry”
about the quality of your work and how much you are learning, rather than focusing on
grades. In the long run, grades are the least important of those issues.
With that said, here’s how you’ll be evaluated this semester:
Client Plansbook                        80
Client Presentation                     50
Peer Evaluation                         20


Team Plansbook Analysis              25
Perfect Pitch Exam                   20
Resume & Cover Letter                 5
TOTAL                               200 points
_______________________________________________________
Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric. Please note: to
ensure fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any
stage. For example, a B- will be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999%. The
University does not recognize the grade of A+.
A = 94-100%
A- = 90-93
B+ = 87-89
B = 84-86
B- = 80-83
C+ = 77-79
C = 74-76
C- = 70-73
D+ = 67-69
D = 64-66
D- = 60-63
F = 0-60
Please note that extra credit will NOT be offered.
CLASSROOM CONDUCT
Cell phones must be silenced at the beginning of each class. Students may not take calls
or answer text and email messages during class time unless it is a dire, life-threatening
emergency. Those who violate this policy will be asked to leave the classroom for the
remainder of the class period and will be marked absent. Private conversations are not
permitted during lectures and in-class discussions.
COURSE STANDARDS AND DEADLINES
    • All reading material and project assignments are to be completed before class
       meetings. It helps the quality of class discussion as well as your level of
       understanding.
    •  All assignments must be turned in on time. Deadlines are absolute. Late
       assignments will not be accepted. This class simulates the real world, and in the
       real world, deadlines are non-negotiable. This means that you/your team will
       receive a 0 for late work. Period.
    •  No make-up assignments/exam, unless you have a documented emergency or
       serious illness.


    •   All work created outside the classroom must be produced on a personal computer
        and be professional in appearance. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors
        will result in a loss of points. If you need help with writing, please use the Moody
        College Writing Support Program, located in BMC 3.322,
        https://moody.utexas.edu/students/moodywriting.
    •   Additionally, all work produced for this class must be original. Enlisting aid from
        anyone outside the class is a breach of UT’s policy on Scholastic Dishonesty (see
        below) and will be dealt with accordingly.
    •   Team presentations are to be presented using Microsoft Office PowerPoint or
        another professional presentation software program/package.
    •   Any questions or arguments about a grade must be presented in writing within
        seven (7) days after the points are posted or returned.
UNIVERSITY AND COURSE POLICIES/STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Use of Email for Official Correspondence to Students
Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are
responsible for reading your email for university and course-related information and
announcements. You are responsible to keep the university informed about changes to
your email address. You should check your email regularly and frequently—to stay
current with university-related communications, some of which may be time-critical.
You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating your email address at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
toward peers and community.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized
collaboration, falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating
honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited
to, providing false or misleading information to receive a postponement or an extension
on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same written
assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By accepting
this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic
dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and readiness for the future
demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on scholastic
dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the
course and/or dismissal from the University.
