COURSE OBJECTIVES:
A. Develop an appreciation for the importance of cell biology, biochemistry and molecular biology in nutrient
   uptake and metabolism.
B. Understand the basic concepts and importance of metabolic regulation at the whole body, organ and
   cellular level.
C. Gain an understanding of how nutrients work alone and together to regulate physiological function.
D. Gain an appreciation for the roles of various organs (liver, muscle, adipose tissue) in macronutrient
   metabolism.
E. Develop the critical thinking required to apply alterations in metabolism to cell function and disease
   process.
F. Start to build problem solving skills to determine mechanisms for physiologic changes and uses in
   macronutrient metabolism in disease states.
G. Build upon the metabolism learned in NTR 312 to prepare the students for NTR 342.
1. Prerequisites for NTR 326
       Credit* in NTR 312 or 312H for Nutrition majors.
       Nutrition 312 with a grade of at least C in each.
2. Students with disabilities.
   Please notify me of any modification/adaptation you may require to accommodate a disability-related need.
   You will be requested to provide documentation to the Dean of Students’ Office, in order that the most
   appropriate accommodations can be determined. Specialized services are available on campus through
   Services for Students with Disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students
   at 471-6259 or 471-4641, https://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.

Grade Determination
   100% 5 Exams (4 Exams count)               (25% for each exam)
   NOTE: THE LOWEST OF ALL 5 EXAMS MAY BE DROPPED
   Grade Reporting
      Grades will be reported as:
        90-100         A
        80-89          B
        70-79          C
        60-69          D
        < 61           F
3. Exams:
      •    ALL LECTURES WILL BE RECORDED ON ZOOM.
      •    LECTURE MATERIAL WILL SERVE AS EXAM QUESTIONS.
      •    If figures/tables from other books are used, then only the information presented in class will be
           used for exams.
      •    THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP EXAMS. If an exam is missed, then that is your dropped
           exam grade.
      •    The material covered will be all the lecture material since the last exam.
      •    Pay special attention to things that are highlighted or asterisked by me in lectures. These items are
           more likely to be test questions.
      •    All exams are multiple choice, open book, online.
      •    Exam times are every Monday during class time.
      •    Questions regarding exam grading should be made, in writing, to the instructor (Dr. Jolly). For
           exam re-evaluation this must occur by the second class day following the return of the exam.
4. Texts:
      •    MANDATORY TEXT:                 Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism, sixth Edition,
           Gropper/Smith/Groff, Thompson-Wadsworth, 2017. Reading assignments for this textbook are
           given in the course outline.
      •    The lecture material is derived from a mixture of cell biology, biochemistry and nutrition textbooks.
5. Lecture Notes
   ü Handouts will be posted on Canvas.
   ü Handouts serve as an outline of the key content of the class and supply many of the diagrams/figures
      that we will discuss.
   ü All lectures are recorded on zoom.


                                                                                            3
6. Discussion sections:
         Ø  No new material will be presented.
         Ø  Ashley Neely (the TA) leads the sections and will reinforce the lecture material.
         Ø  This is your time to gain clarification on lecture material.
         Ø  Bring your questions!
