                           Introduction to American Studies: Closer to Home (31005/38735)
Course Description:
AMS 310 is designed to provide an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of American Studies, the study of
American history, culture, and politics. Though not a comprehensive U.S. history survey, this course will cover a broad
time period, beginning at the turn of the twentieth century and extending into the present day. “Home” will serve as our
central theme and organizing framework, allowing us to track changes and ideas in the American past in three major
ways. First, we will examine “home” in a literal sense, as a dwelling place or lack thereof, to help us uncover persistent
forms of racial and economic inequality. Second, we will consider “home” in a metaphorical sense, as a powerful and
enduring symbol of the nation as a whole, drawing our attention to issues of immigration and citizenship. Finally, we
will consider “home” in an ideological sense, as a place where ideas about family, gender roles, and sexuality cohere.
Throughout, this course will examine shifts in what it has meant to be American, the ways in which that identity has
worked to bring people together and push them apart, to bestow power and privilege on some while taking them away
from others. Hopefully, students will come away from this course with a firm grounding in the diverse methods of
American Studies research, a richer understanding of the American past, and a deeper sense of the multiple meanings of
home in the present.
Goals:
• To introduce you to a range of materials and methods that can be used to analyze American history,
   culture, and politics.
• To gain a better understanding of American history over the course of the 20th century.
• To learn how to identify and construct arguments.
• To understand the ways that the domestic sphere is always connected to the broader world.
Major Questions:
• What is American Studies?
• Who is does the term “American” include? Who does it exclude?
• How has “home” functioned as a symbol in American political, cultural, and social dialogue?
• What can a focus on the home reveal about transformations in this nation over the past century?
• Where are you most “at home?” How have your homes (in both literal and metaphorical senses)
   impacted you?

Participation: Attendance in this course will not be recorded, but you will not be able to succeed if you do not
regularly attend lecture. Over the course of the semester you will be asked to turn in 10 brief in-class writing
assignments which will be graded credit/no credit. Of these 10 writing assignments, 8 will take place on unannounced
class days. The other two are related to the following in-class scheduled activities:
     1) Visit the Harry Ransom Center to analyze primary materials from their collection related to our course themes.
         Half the class will visit the archives on March 5th and the other half of the class will visit the archives on the 7th.
     2) Visit the Christian-Green Gallery to examine an exhibition of the LA-based photographer Genevieve Gaignard.
         Half the class will visit the gallery on April 9th and the other half of the class will visit the gallery on April 11th.
First and third essays: The first and third essays will ask you to define key terms from lecture and to connect them to
course readings. For each essay you will have a choice of two prompts which will be announced no less than two weeks
in advance. The first 4-5 page essay will be based on your historical understanding of The Lucky Ones and lecture
material from the first third of the course. It will be due Friday, February 22nd. The third essay will be due on Friday,
May 10 and will be 5-6 pages. This essay will require you to draw on readings and lectures from the last two-thirds of
the semester. These essays should refer ONLY to course material, and do not require additional research.
Second essay: Much of this course will be devoted to analyzing domestic spaces and to understanding how the home is
always connected to larger social, political, and cultural transformations. For this essay you will be required to describe
and analyze a residence in which you have lived for at least a year. You will have to do some background research about
this place: When was it built? For whom? How did you come to live there? How did the structure and location of this
place affect your life at the daily level and/or in the long-term? This essay will also be 4-5 pages in length, plus a
creative rendering of the space. This essay will be due Friday, April 5th.
Online reading quizzes: There will be one online reading quiz for each of the four central texts in this course. You will
be able to take these quizzes whenever you choose within the section of the course to which they correspond. You will
have until 11:59 pm Sunday, February 24th to complete the first quiz. You will have until 11:59 pm Sunday, April
7th to complete the second and third quizzes. You will have until 11:59 pm Sunday, May 12th to complete the fourth
quiz. No extensions will be granted for quizzes.
All essays should be turned in on CANVAS and printed out and delivered to the American Studies Department on the 4 th
floor of Burdine Hall by 4pm the day they are due.

Additional Notes:
Cultural diversity flag: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. “The Cultural Diversity
requirement increases your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural experience. Courses
carrying this flag ask you to explore the beliefs, practices, and histories of at least one cultural group that has
experienced persistent marginalization. Many of these courses also encourage you to reflect on your own cultural
experiences.” https://ugs.utexas.edu/flags/students/about/cultural-diversity
                                                                                                                               2


Class conduct: Students are expected to be attentive, respectful, and polite to all classmates and instructors. Cell
phones, laptops, and hand-held electronic devices must be turned off and stowed during class. Students who
engage in disruptive or disrespectful behavior (e.g. falling asleep, engaging in side conversations, using cell phones) will
be asked to leave the classroom.
Supplemental Instruction (SI) Sections: This course includes SI discussion sections. Ms. Christine Castro will be
leading two SI sessions per week. SI sections provide an opportunity to analyze, review, and reinforce all aspects of the
course material—from specific details on lectures and reading assignments to wider thematic connections across
different time periods. Although optional, SI sections represent an invaluable learning opportunity in a helpful,
supportive, and smaller learning environment. Moreover, regular SI attendance has shown to improve overall student
performance by an average of one-half to a full letter grade above the class mean. SI sessions will be held Wednesdays
6-7pm in GDC 2.210 and Fridays 2-3pm in GDC 2.210.
Writing assistance: I strongly encourage you to use the Undergraduate Writing Center, FAC 211, 471-6222,
http://www.uwc.utexas.edu. The Undergraduate Writing Center offers free, individualized, expert help with writing for
any UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis.
Academic honesty: I will use Turnitin software on CANVAS. Students who commit acts of academic dishonesty (ex.
plagiarism) will receive a 0 on the assignment, and will be referred to the Student Judicial Services and the Office of the
Dean of Students. Please visit the Student Judicial Services website for additional information:
www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/. Plagiarism occurs if you represent as your own work any material that was obtained
from another source, regardless of how or where you acquired it. For examples of plagiarism, see
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis_plagiarism.php
Students with disabilities: Any student with a documented disability that requires academic accommodations should
contact the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) through the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement
at: 471-6259 (voice), or 471-4641 (TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing) as soon as possible to request an
official letter outlining authorized accommodations. Please submit this official letter to me within the first two weeks of
class (by Thursday, January 31). For all other SSD information, please see: http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/.
Essay extensions: Failure to hand in an essay without making prior arrangements with the Teaching Assistants or me
will result in a 0. I will allow you to have an essay extension only in the event of a documented medical or family
emergency, or if you have official, documented University of Texas at Austin business outside of campus. In both cases,
you must notify the TAs or me BEFORE the assignment is due. Assignments turned in late without a permitted
extension will lose one letter grade for each day past the due date.
Grievance procedure: If you would like the teaching team to review your essay after it has been graded, please
carefully review the comments of the TA who graded your assignment and wait a minimum of 24 hours before
contacting the TA. Thereafter, you should make sure to address all questions about your grade WITHIN 8 days after you
have received your essay back. If you do not reach an understanding with your TA, then I will be happy to review your
essay, as well. Please bear in mind that this process—including my review—should occur within this same 8-day period.
