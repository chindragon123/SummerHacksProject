1) Course Description: In this course, students will evaluate a variety of Advertising and Public Relations
Management issues. Students will learn how to become professional decision-makers and how to effectively and
respectfully communicate, elaborate on, and defend their decisions. The corporate landscape is changing. A 2017
Gallup survey reported that 43% of workers said they spent at least some time working remotely during the last
year. Since this course is an online course, students will master how to succeed in a workplace environment that has
a larger digital footprint. This course carries a writing flag. So, effective professional writing is central to your
success in this course. Learning how to effectively communicate through writing is a key skill employers look for in
potential new hires and for promotions!
2) Course Learning Outcomes:
     WHAT:          Evaluate advertising and public relations management issues utilizing the Case method.
     HOW:            Students will read and evaluate cases weekly in class. Students will also complete two case
                    analyses during the course.
     WHAT:          Present a case analysis in a professional manner.
     HOW:           In your future internship/job presentations provide an opportunity to showcase your mastery of
                    skills to internal and external teams. Becoming a great presenter is a skill that requires practice.
                    Students will practice their presentation skills by recording a presentation of their case analysis.
     WHAT:          Professionally critique a colleague on a case presentation.
     HOW:           Students will watch a classmate’s case presentation and provide constructive feedback on how
                    they could improve in their presentation content and style in the future. A primary management
                    function will be evaluating colleagues and those who will eventually report to you. In this class,
                    we will learn and discuss effectives ways to do this.
     WHAT:          Participate in professional discussions with colleagues, where you make a decision and
                    defend your choice in an informed, fact-based manner.
     HOW:           Students will participate in a small discussion group that will simulate their internal work
                    colleagues. Students will make decisions and discuss and defend their choices in their small
                    groups. Group participation can be as fun and enjoyable as you make it. Have discussions and
                    learn from one another!
3) Course Catalog Prerequisites: Advertising 344K and 345J with a grade of at least C in each; and Marketing
320F or 337 with a grade of at least C.
4) How to succeed in this course:
          Participate: As a student in online courses, I often felt a sense of isolation and anonymity. To combat
          those feelings, you will be assigned to a small group where you will get to know a few
          classmates/colleagues and have respectful fact-based discussions and debates. Remember, in a case-based
          course, interesting, thought provoking discussion is imperative.
          Collaborate: A career path in advertising and public relations is driven through collaboration and
          discussion. Your small group will become your day-to-day colleagues.
          Give Feedback: Students will learn how to provide constructive feedback to one another. Also,
          throughout the semester, please give your feedback on how you learn to me, topics that interest you, or how
          this course can help you land internship and job opportunities. This is your course! Help me make it one
          you will enjoy and look forward to participating in rather than a course you feel like you dread!
          Respect your fellow classmates: In this course, online discussions are an integral component of this
          course. Expressing your opinion is necessary; however, it is important to remember that others might not
          hold your same viewpoint. Discussions and healthy debates are an important part of the educational
          process. Please remember to respect your classmates and your professor in all classroom discussions. If
          you are in violation of this policy, your small group participation grade might be impacted or you may be


        removed from your small group. If you are asked to leave your small group for behavioral violations, you
        will receive a zero for your participation grade.
        Know your industry: Students should read blogs, newsletters, or other periodicals that are relevant to the
        class discussion and use them as inspiration for blog posts and online discussion. We are in a field that is
        constantly evolving, and it is crucial to stay on top of new developments.
                                        COURSE REQUIREMENTS:
1) Required Readings and Materials:
                      ▪    Murphy, J.H., Cunningham, I.C.M., Stavchansky de Lewis, L. (2011). Integrated Brand
                           Promotion Management: Text, Cases, & Exercises.
                      ▪    Readings posted on the course website and/or distributed in class
2) Major Course assignments: Assignments add up to a total of 100 possible points.
        Open-Note Quizzes: (4 quizzes - points 5 points each, total 20 points): During the course, students will
        complete four quizzes. These quizzes are open note and open book and will evaluate mastery of key
        concepts from lectures, readings, and assigned cases. These will be completed on Canvas.
        Individual Case Analysis (1st: 10 points, 2nd: 20 points, total 30 points): Students will complete two
        individual case analysis assignments during the semester. Students should reference the framework
        included in the textbook on p. 6 (Exhibit 1) for the assignment. Each analysis should include the following
        sections: Statement of the Problem, List of Critical Factors, Evaluation of Alternatives, Pro/Con
        Discussion, Conclusion, Additional Comments, and References. Students should also reference the “Case
        Analysis Process” on p. 7 (Exhibit 2) of the textbook. The case analyses should be 2 single-spaced typed
        pages in length (excluding references), and use 12 pt. sized font and 1 inch document margins. Case
        Analyses should be submitted to the assignment portal on Canvas by the due date. This is an individual
        assignment. As such, students should not discuss their approaches with one another.
        Individual Case Presentation (15 points): Students will individually present their individual case
        analyses. Presentations should be 10 minutes in length. Presentations should be submitted to the assignment
        portal on Canvas by the due date. Your grade will be determined by your delivery, content, and
        presentation visuals. A more detailed assignment sheet and rubric will be posted on Canvas.
        Individual Presentation Critique (10 points): Students will review one of their colleagues’ presentations
        and provide thoughtful, constructive, actionable written feedback on their colleague’s content and
        presentation style. The feedback should be between 250 – 400 words.
        Blog Post and Small Group Moderation: (Blog post: 10 points, Moderation: 5 points, 15 points total):
        This assignment requires students to step into the role of a manager and moderate a discussion on a current
        issue in advertising and public relations. Students are expected to write a blog-style post that they will
        submit to their small group and moderate a discussion with their colleagues on the issue. Students will
        record a short 2-5 minute video to provide background on the blog and practice how different forms of
        media can be utilized together. Blog-style writing is a little more informal; however, it should still maintain
        proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation. This assignment will also require you to “take a stand” on a
        current issue and elaborate and defend your opinion when necessary in a professional, respectful manner.
        Students will sign up for the day their blog post is due during the first week of class.


        Facebook Small Group Participation: (10 points): Discussion is imperative in a case-based course. In
        order to make class discussions more interactive and interesting, you will be required to join a small
        Facebook group that consists of 6-7 students and post daily. In this group, you will be responsible for
        completing the following: 1) posting a short introduction video, 2) participating in case discussion prompts,
        3) participating in discussions on classmates’ blog posts.

                                       POLICIES AND RESOURCES
1) Classroom Policies:
         A. Grading Policies: In this course, grades are not given. They are earned. Therefore, I do not give you
             a grade; rather, you earn your grade. For each assignment, you will be provided with a detailed rubric
             of how you earned your final score.
         B. Policy on late work: Late Work will not be accepted. Exceptions will be made under extreme
             circumstances, if the student discusses the issue with the instructor ahead of time, either in person or
             via e-mail/phone.
         C. Plagiarism: In accordance with the UT Honor Code, Plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. If
             words are not your own or are taken from another source, they must be properly quoted and cited. If
             you have any questions about plagiarism, proper citations, etc., please see me. Please read the
             http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct
         D. Course Communication: If you send me an email during business days, please expect a response
             within 24 hours. If an email is received on the weekend, please expect a response by Monday evening.
             All emails should be written in a professional manner. I will not respond to emails that are not
             properly formatted and/or include severe spelling/grammatical errors. I will assume that your email is
             spam if it is poorly written. If you are unsure as to how to properly format an email, please visit:
             http://smallbusiness.chron.com/proper-business-email-format-40878.html.
         E. Writing Flag: This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
             experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly
             during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor
             to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or more
             assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect
             a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core
             Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal
             Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
