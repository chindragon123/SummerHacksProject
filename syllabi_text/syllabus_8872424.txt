COURSE OBJECTIVES:
The objective of this course is to introduce students to the fundamentals of building materials and related
construction methods. The class will involve lectures, videos, class discussion, group exercises, and student
presentations. By taking this class you will be able to:
    1) Recognize and understand the technical vocabulary related to materials and methods of building
         construction;
    2) Identify and analyze different components, their properties, and their three-dimensional
         configurations;
    3) Understand manufacturing/fabrication and site construction processes.
Team exercises will serve as one of the primary mechanisms for further developing problem-solving and
technical communication skills.
TOPICS COVERED:
This course will cover general building material properties, codes and standards, and material
properties/construction methods pertaining to soils, foundations, concrete, metals, wood, masonry, cladding
systems, roofing, and finishes. In the context of buildings, emphasis is on engineered systems and materials,
rather than those designed primarily by architects.

                  C-:      70 ≤ grade < 73
The instructor reserves the right to adjust letter grades, upward only, based on individual attendance and
class participation if the numerical grade warrants such consideration.
Students are expected to actively participate and contribute to class discussions and the team projects.
COURSE/INSTRUCTOR EVALUATIONS:
An evaluation of the course and instructor will be conducted at the end of the semester using the approved
UT Course/Instructor evaluation forms.
                                                       2


POLICIES:
Exams, Quizzes, and Group Assignments:
Exam dates are listed on the syllabus. Make-up exams will only be available to those with legitimate,
documented medical reasons (as verified with a note from a physician). Please note the date of the final
exam - no early exams will be given.
This course, by necessity, involves the introduction of a large number of new technical terms. Exams will
emphasize both concepts discussed in class and technical vocabulary. Acquiring a technical vocabulary
does not come easy for most of us and doesn’t result from last minute exam “cramming.” Learning theory
has proven that mental retention of new terms occurs best with repetitive study and usage/application.
Accordingly, please read assignments prior to class, review course notes periodically, ask questions for any
clarifications needed, and try to make the terms part of your class projects, presentations, and “everyday”
working technical vocabulary.
The student is responsible for all reading assignments and class handouts whether or not covered in class
or listed on the syllabus.
All assignments are due at the beginning of the period assigned and those turned in late will count off
10% per day. (no exceptions!--except those listed for the exam make-up)
Quizzes and exams will not be returned to the student. The quizzes and exams solutions will be reviewed
in class. You can view your quizzes and exams during office hours.
Class Participation and Attendance:
It is important that you are familiar with the course material as the course evolves. Your ability to answer
questions and discuss the material will be part of the overall participation evaluation. Therefore, you should
review class material ahead of time. Regular attendance is expected and encouraged. Your attendance will
be used to evaluate your participation grade. I consider a student missing more than one week of class
lectures without excuse to be a serious participation problem. In some cases, I will petition the Office of
Student Affairs to drop students from the course who have excessive absences and may withhold the entire
participation grade at my discretion for participation problems. Each student is responsible for all material
and administrative instructions given during the lecture period.
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a
religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that
arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.
Personal Problems:
If you have illness or personal problems that will affect your performance during the course of the semester,
please let me know as soon as possible. “After the fact” provides little protection unless there are extreme
circumstances. I have an answering machine, a fax machine, and an e-mail address if you need to get in
touch with me after hours. Do not hesitate to use them.
                                                       3

assigned with approval from the Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Dean. From the 21st class day through
the last class day, graduate students can drop a class with permission from the instructor, Graduate Advisor,
and the Graduate Dean. Students with 20-hr/week GRA/TA appointment or a fellowship may not drop
below 9 hours.
Computer Usage:
Students are expected to be proficient on a personal computer and to be able to use CAD, word processing,
and spreadsheet programs. Familiarity with the Civil Engineering Learning Resources Center (LRC) is
assumed. The web-based UT Canvas system will be used extensively to coordinate class assignments and
disseminate course information, including class notes.

Recommendations Regarding Emergency Evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security (512-
471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/)
      Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
          buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
          assembling outside (across the bridge).
      Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may
          occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
          building.
      Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
          week of class.
      In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter
          a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Dept., The University of Texas
          at Austin Police Dept., or Fire Prevention Services office.
