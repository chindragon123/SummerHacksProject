                                                                                   Professor Osseo-Asare
Course Description
How do societies understand illness? How do they restore good health?
In this course, we explore how communities have confronted disease throughout Africa’s history.
During the first six weeks, we read about the changing role of specialist healers since the 1700s,
including shamans, malams, nurses, and drug peddlers. The second half of the course turns to the
history of specific diseases including malaria, AIDS, and Ebola through regional case studies.
Particular emphasis is placed on pre-colonial and traditional healing, medical education, colonial
therapeutics, and the impact of environmental change.
Throughout the course of the semester, participants will be able to hone their historical research skills
through primary source labs. The research labs will incorporate analysis of historical documents and
artifacts related to particular aspects of therapeutics and sickness in Africa.
Overall, this course offers participants a nuanced, historical perspective on the current health crisis in
Africa. Staggering figures place the burden of global disease in Africa; not only AIDS and malaria, but
also pneumonia, diarrhea and mental illness significantly affect the lives of everyday people. Studying
the history of illness and healing in African societies provides a framework with which to interpret the
social, political, and environmental factors shaping international health today.
No previous coursework in African history is expected. Course participants will make two oral and
written reports on weekly assignments. There will also be one longer research paper (8-10 pages) on
the history of a particular health concern.
Course Goals
After completing History 350L “Medicine in Africa” you should be able to:
1) Identify 3 key cultural influences on African healing strategies since the 1800s.
2) Describe generally the changing relationships between society, disease and environment in the
     context of 5 illnesses in African history.
3) Conduct basic research on the history of African health using multiple sources.
4) Describe in detail the history of a specific illness, or category of healing in an African country or
     region.


 Flags:

Description of Course Assignments:
Class Discussions (40 points)
          To prepare for class, set aside time to read the assigned books and articles at least two
          days in advance of the class meeting. Depending on how fast you read and your
          familiarity with historical texts and African history, it will take between 2 to 8 hours to
          digest the roughly 200 pages for each week. You may find it helpful to type or write
          down questions and points of interest as you read or shortly afterwards. Be sure to
          print out any e-reserves and highlight key ideas.

       During class, each participant will have a chance to respond to the readings and raise
       questions and thoughts. Be considerate of others, but be sure your opinions are heard!
Oral Reports/Response Paper (20 points total)
       Each participant will make two brief reports on assigned readings throughout the course
       of the semester. Oral reports should be no more than 3 to 5 minutes in length.
       The idea is not to provide an exhaustive summary of readings. Rather aim to highlight
       the main points of each reading and explain any criticisms you have of the author’s
       approach. At the end of the oral report, provide a general question that links together all
       the week’s readings.
       Response papers are to be submitted the day of the class when oral reports are made
       on Canvas. Each response paper should be 1-2 pages double spaced (12 point font
       with 1 ½” margins). Each should be a well written, closely argued statement that
       synthesizes and connects the week’s readings. It is not necessary, however, to use any
       outside sources to supplement your discussion of the assigned books and/or articles.
Final Paper (40 points)
       Each participant is responsible for one mid-length paper on the history of a particular
       health concern or category of healing from a region or country in Africa (6-8 pages
       double spaced, 12 point font with 1 ½” margins). Final projects are due at 5 pm on
       Canvas Monday Dec 8. Late submissions will result in -10 points/day.
Quality of the final paper (40 points total) will depend on:
   •   Creative use of available sources, both primary and secondary (10 points)
   •   Attention to course themes (10 points)
   •   Historical accuracy (10 points)
   •   Effective style, spelling, and grammar (10 points)
