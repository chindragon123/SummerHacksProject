III. COURSE DESCRIPTION, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES
This course offers an overview of Iberian and Latin American literatures and cultures, including
the arts and popular expressions, from a multidisciplinary perspective. Considering that culture is
a wider concept than literature but that both involve a social and communicative system, in this
course you will not only engage in a chronological study of literary texts within a social,
historical, linguistic, and theoretical context, but also as an introduction to a new world of
experience between the text and you, the reader. You will read some of the works in their
entirety and others as selected passages. Class discussions, lectures, writing assignments, and
assessments will be completed entirely in Spanish.
This course will guide you, the student, to
    • Relate historical, cultural, social, geopolitical background to texts and their authors,
        themes, genres, and styles;
    • Identify, discuss, and analyze literary works and the main tendencies of a certain literary
        period;
    • Understand some principal concepts of literary theory;
    • Appreciate the role of literary aesthetics in a social and communicative system;
    • Understand the cultural and literary memory of a wide range of signs (symbols, images,
        melodies, etc.) in texts;


As you develop your understanding of literature and culture in this course you will be expected
to demonstrate your capacity to
    • Place and classify literary phenomena in a socioeconomic, historical context including
        discussion and analysis of authors, their works, literary schools, main tendencies,
        techniques, styles, genres, and literary periods;
    • Make connections between literary, cultural, and chronological developments;
    • Identify and distinguish the different functions of literature since their beginnings;
    • Apply theoretical devices and literary terminology to analyze literary texts;
    • Interpret texts using close reading, textual analysis and comparison;
    • Develop, discuss, and support your interpretation of a text;
    • Use appropriate analytical language to present well-developed written or oral replies to
        questions or commentary about a text.
PLEASE NOTE: You are responsible for checking all assignments on a daily basis through the
Canvas calendar. Remember that many course activities have a due date. You can do them in
advance; there will be no extensions for any reason including the server going down at the last
minute or your computer crashing.
IV. FLAG COURSE COMPONENT. This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global
Cultures courses are designed to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United
States. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from
assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group,
past or present.
V. INFORMATION ABOUT GRADES
Your grade will be based on the following percentages. For more details see Section X.

VI. ATTENDANCE POLICY: Regular class attendance is required. Late work is not
accepted nor are there make-ups for missed work, including exams and quizzes. However, a
student who is absent from a class or examination for the observance of a religious holy day or a


university-sponsored activity may complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the
absence, if proper notice of the planned absence has been given at least two weeks in advance.
Students who will be absent owing to a university-sponsored activity must present a letter from
the department or office sponsoring the event, giving the student’s name, the dates of the
expected absence(s), and the reason for the absence(s). You will be allowed two absences; after
two absences, your grade will be dropped 1% on a scale of 100 for each additional absence. You
are responsible for signing the attendance sheet each day you attend.
VII. ACADEMIC ACCOMODATIONS: I will be available to discuss appropriate academic
accommodations that you may require as a student with a disability. Before I can make course
accommodations, you must provide documentation from the Office of the Dean of Students-
Services for Students with Disabilities. (This is in compliance with the Rehabilitation Act of
1973-Section 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act/ADA.) Any accommodations will be
as of the day you present the letter to me.
VIII. SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY: Students who violate University rules on scholastic
dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course
and/or dismissal from The University of Texas. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all
students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. For more information, visit Student Judicial Services (SJS) at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs
IX. EMERGENCY EVACUATION POLICY. Occupants of buildings on The University of
Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm
activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with
all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit
door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department,
The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
Information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at
http://emergency.utexas.edu/
X. COURSE ASSESSMENT
ACTIVITIES: You will complete both in-class and online activities throughout the course. In
order to complete the in-class activity you must be present.
QUIZZES: Content quizzes will be included in each Unit. Some will be online; others will be
in-class. The quizzes will assess your understanding of literary devices, periods, and authors as
well as your ability to comprehend and respond to reading selections. For online quizzes you
may use your notes and you can work with your classmates; however, each student must submit
the response for their individual quiz (some questions and responses may vary from one quiz to
another).


EXAMS: Your exams will include short responses as well as short essays both about literature
and cultural material (practices, beliefs, and histories) related to the literature being studied.
Although your ability to respond to literature is the focus of the essays, 30% of the score will be
based on your Spanish language usage. Information about exams will be given in class and/or
posted on the course site.
FINAL EXAMINATION
The final exam will be comprehensive and will cover all the literary and cultural material
(practices, beliefs, and histories) studied during the session. The exam will include short
responses as well as essay responses. As in the exams, Spanish language usage will comprise
30% of your grade.
XI. COURSE CALENDAR (Subject to change if needed)
A detailed course calendar will be posted on Canvas by Units. It is your responsibility to check it
