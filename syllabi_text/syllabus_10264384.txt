“The Ancient Mediterranean World” (AMW) is an introductory survey of the major civilizations
of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Italy, from around 3000 BCE to the 400s CE. Each had its
distinctive character, but vigorous cultural exchange in the region and beyond led to the
assimilation, adaptation, or rejection (or a combination) by one culture of the ideas and practices
of others. A major theme will be cultural interaction and its implications for understanding the
historical development of the various peoples living in this region. Other themes include: the
systems of government and political authority, social structures (class, gender, generational),
religion, war and violence, and the ancient economy. The lectures and discussion sections will
introduce you to many of the sources and analytical methods of the ancient scholar. The evidence
is wide-ranging and includes literary texts, documents written on papyri and inscribed on stone,
artifacts (such as coins, vase painting, sculpture, burials, personal adornment, and houses), and
more. This class will give you experience in interpreting these primary sources and constructing
historical arguments based on reason and evidence.

I. Flags
This course carries a ​Global Cultures Flag.​ Global Cultures courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. Your grade will be based on
assignments dealing with the practices, beliefs, and histories of the ancient civilizations of the
Mediterranean basin, informed by literature and archaeology.
II. Texts
        ●       Required:​ John Haywood, ​The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Civilizations
        (Penguin).
        ●       Recommended: D. Brendan Nagle, ​The Ancient World. A Social and Cultural
        History​ (8​th​ ed.).
I will be photocopying Nagle and making it available on Canvas.​ As such, you do not need to
purchase or rent it, though you ​must have a physical copy of the Haywood, ​because of the
detailed maps that do not translate well to photocopying​.​ If you’d like a physical copy please feel
free to purchase the Nagle, as we will be using both consistently throughout the semester.
You are required to have a subscription to Top Hat​.​ All of my presentations will run through
Top Hat and we will have regular quizzes and discussions in class using this platform. To
subscribe, please go to tophat.com. I have sent each of you an invitation to the course page (to
the email you have provided to the UT directory). Please see me if you did not receive an
invitation.
There will be additional readings or electronic resources posted to Canvas for the discussion
sections and for the lecture days.
III. Course Requirements and Grading
BREAKDOWN
        Exams (55%)
            - Exam 1 (15%) on Feb 26th
            - Exam 2 (20%) on April 8th
            - Exam 3 (20%) ​Final exam period,​ ​tentatively​ May 15, 9-12pm
        Participation in Lecture and TopHat (15%)
        Participation and Attendance in Discussion Sections (20%)
        Written/Creative Assignment (10%) ​due the Friday before Spring Break
                                                    2/ 9


Exams (55%): ​You will have ​three exams: ​two during the semester and one on the university’s
scheduled final exam date. Each exam will count for 15-20 percent of your grade. They are NOT
cumulative. Instead, they will each cover one third of the course material. Each exam is designed
to take 50 minutes, and will have three sections: slide identification, short answer, and essay.
Participation in lecture and TopHat (15%): ​We will have periodic multiple choice, short
answer, and map questions during lectures, facilitated through the program TopHat. These
Tophat questions will be factored into your participation grade, and cannot be made up if you are
absent. I allow three no-questions-asked lecture absences before absences begin to affect your
grade (1% per each day absent).
Participation and attendance in Discussion Sections (20%)​: Our weekly discussion sessions
provide an opportunity for you to encounter primary sources from each cultural group we will
focus on. They are designed to teach you how to read, analyze, and critique ancient sources. You
are required to attend your discussion session each week. You will be allowed two unexcused
absences. You will lose 1% of your possible 20% for each additional absence. You will also be
required to come to each session prepared to participate. This means you will have read the
assigned readings, made notes on the readings and any discussion questions included with the
readings, and prepared additional comments or questions on the readings. You can find these
readings on Canvas. Just attending the sessions WILL NOT fulfill the 20% allotted to these
sessions. Please bring all reading assignments with you to the session.
Written/ Creative Assignment (10%): ​You will have a short assignment due the Friday before
spring break. This assignment can take two forms. First, you can write a short (min 3 pages
double spaced, max 4 pages double spaced) podcast transcript, where you will pick an object
from a museum’s collection, research it, and write about the object and what it tells us about the
context and culture it came from. Alternatively, you can do a creative assignment. This
expression can take many forms, including (but not limited to): representational or
non-representational/abstract art (e.g. painting, sculpture, textiles); creative writing (poetry, short
stories, scripts); digital media projects; multimedia projects (e.g. audio, video), cooking, etc.
Your prompt is the place of ancient civilizations in the modern world, and any submissions must
have an accompanying 250-500 word response where you explain your project and your creative
intentions.​ Creative assignments MUST be approved by the instructor before you start your
project​. For more information and instructions, please see the assignment page on Canvas.
                                                     3/ 9


VII. Evaluation and Grading
All grades are based on the following grading scale:
                     100-93 A                                         76.9-73 C
                    92.9-90 A-                                        72.9-70 C-
                    89.9-87 B+                                       69.9-67 D+
                     86.9-83 B                                        66.9-63 D
                    82.9-80 B-                                        62.9-60 D-
                    79.9-77 C+                                         59.9-0 F
We will not grade on a curve for this course. All grading, even on short quizzes, will be done on
a 100-point scale: A = 90-100, B = 80-90, etc. ​We will not negotiate a final grade ​unless there
has been a demonstrable error, either in calculation or content.
If you would like to discuss a grade on a quiz or test, you must meet with us within one week of
receiving the graded quiz/exam. I will not review grades after this window. Please remember
that, according to federal law (FERPA), we cannot discuss specific grades over email. You must
make an appointment or come to our office hours to discuss your grades.
If you feel that you are having problems in this class, please come talk to your instructor or TA
and we will work together to address the things that are causing problems. We’re here to help, so
please reach out!
IV. Lectures
There will be two weekly lectures (MW 9:00-10:00, Waggener Hall 201). These will combine
historical outline, discussion of major themes, and exploration of problems in the interpretation
of historical evidence. In order to get the most out of the lectures, you should complete the
reading assignments in advance of the lecture. The lectures will amplify the reading materials by
placing them in a broader narrative.
V. Discussion Sections
The assignments for discussion section will usually include a set of questions concerning the
readings. You should come prepared to discuss these questions in an informed and respectful
                                                    4/ 9


manner. The main purpose of the discussion sections is to learn how to analyze ancient sources
and how to evaluate the interpretations of others. Please bring the assigned readings/images with
you to section, either printed out or available on your laptop. Not bringing materials to class will
adversely affect your participation grade. (Please do not bring assignments on your phone as they
do not afford for easy navigation either of images or long texts).
These weekly sections are required. Repeated tardiness or early departures will contribute to
your absence count. For absences due to illness or accident, notify us of your situation as soon as
possible and be prepared to provide adequate documentation if asked. In the event of an excused
absence, you may attend a different discussion section, but ​only with advance permission​. ​The
upshot is that attendance in discussion sections is critically important—you cannot ​discuss if you
are not present at the discussion section. ​Take the lectures and section meetings seriously. If
you miss a class session, you will have to get notes from another student.
V. General Information
Email and Office Hours
The best way to contact your instructor or teaching assistant is via email. We will do our best to
respond to your emails within a 24-hour period of time. We typically will not return email after
5:00pm on weekdays or during the weekends, unless the matter is urgent.
You are also expected to check email on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with
University and course-related communications, recognizing that some emails may be
time-critical. Remember to set your Canvas conversation and announcement notifications to
“ASAP.” Please be aware that ​you will be held responsible for whatever
information/deadlines I include in emails or on Canvas regardless of whether you read
them. ​It is your responsibility to maintain a functioning email account linked to Canvas. Read
the UT email policy here:
https://cio.utexas.edu/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy
You are welcome and encouraged to come to office hours if you are having any problems with
the course material. If you are unable to make it to scheduled office hours, please let us know
and we will schedule another time to meet. Always come to office hours prepared with an
agenda for the discussion.
Class​ ​Etiquette
Please, ​arrive on time and remain for the duration of the class​. Late arrivals and early departures
are disruptive and rude to the lecturer and your classmates. Leaving and returning during the
                                                    5/ 9


middle of class is equally disruptive. Please attend to your personal needs prior to the beginning
of class.
Electronic devices
Electronic devices are allowed (and encouraged) in class, as you’ll need them for Tophat. You
are all adults, and I trust that you will be able to use technology responsibly in the classroom. I
expect you to use this technology to participate in class only. If having computers or phones in
lecture and discussion sections proves to be a distraction, I reserve the right to ask you to put
your devices away. I also reserve the right to ask for a technology-free classroom, should the
problem persist.
VIII. University Policies
Academic Dishonesty
Academic dishonesty refers to a variety of practices that will not be tolerated in this class. ANY
attempt to pass off another’s work as your own constitutes academic dishonesty. This includes,
but is not limited to: Looking at classmates’ tests or quizzes in order to use their answers as your
own, discussing answers with another student during an exam or quiz, using notes during a quiz
or test, copying homework either from another student or online answer key, etc. All work done
in this class should reflect your own efforts and comply with the University of Texas Honor
Code (below). Any instance of academic dishonesty will result in zero credit for the assignment,
exam, or test and will be reported to the Student Judicial Services. For more information, contact
Student Judicial Services at 471-2841, or go
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php
University of Texas Honor Code:
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected
to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and
community.
The code is apple pie.
Religious holidays
If you need to miss a discussion section, midterm, final exam, or other required class activity for
the observance of a religious holiday, you must notify me at least 14 days in advance so we can
make alternative arrangements for your absence. The University's Religious Days Policy is
online: http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/
                                                       6/ 9


Late Work and Make-Up Tests
Make-up exams will be arranged only in the event of documented illness or other emergencies,
and you must let me know as far in advance of the exam as possible. In all cases proper
documentation must be provided.
Special Accommodations
 The University of Texas provides upon request appropriate accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. You must go through SSD to receive accommodations. Contact the
Office of the Dean of Students for more information at 471-6259 or
http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/. Once you have the proper paperwork, please let me know
immediately if you need accommodation for disabilities.
If you, or one of your fellow students, are having any troubles, the university provides a variety
of services. The​ Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)​ is a good place to start. This service
is provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and
Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of
Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit https://besafe.utexas.edu/behavior-

The weekly lecture topics, readings, assignments, and class exercises are planned to fit the
