I. Rationale: Archaeology covers a critical part of the human past—from the cultural
development of our hominin ancestors to the invention of writing (and beyond). Overlapping
with the time scales of both geology and history, archaeology uses the material record to tell the
story of how we became human, and how human societies developed from small bands of mobile
hunter-gatherers into the states and empires we know from the historical record. Archaeology
explores the global human experience, and its core themes remain important to understanding
today’s world: human-environment dynamics, the social construction of inequality, and the
social and ecological impact of urban life. Understanding the human experience from the
archaeological viewpoint offers a deep perspective on the world that we live in today.
Global Cultures Flag: This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are
designed to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the
practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
II. Course Aims and Objectives:
Aims: Required readings, lectures, and lab sections are designed to work together to achieve
several core aims. These include presentation of the basic facts of world prehistory, discussion
                                                       1


of key conceptual issues in archaeology, consideration of the methods that archaeologists use to
reconstruct the past, and the limitations of archaeological knowledge.
Real-Life Skills: This class focuses on developing basic skills that employers look for. Reading
assignments are designed to develop skills in rapid information processing and self-organized
work. The attendance requirement for lectures promotes consistent work performance. Lab
activities are designed to build team-based problem solving and data analytics skills.
Specific Learning Objectives:
By the end of this course, students will:
         •   demonstrate mastery of the key facts of world prehistory by successfully answering
             multiple-choice questions drawn from required readings during lecture meetings.
         •   show a critical understanding of key issues in world prehistory by writing responses
             to a range of questions on long-term developments of human social organization.
         •   express a knowledge of important questions of archaeological methods and
             professional practice by successfully completing laboratory activities.
III. Format and Procedures: There are three important parts of this course: 1. Individual
preparation. Students are expected to come to lectures and lab sections having already read the
required reading for that day. 2. Lecture (T/Th, 8:30-9:20 am) will present a global overview
of world prehistory and key concepts in archaeology. Lectures are intended to clarify student
questions about required readings and to frame them conceptually. 3. Laboratory sections
focus on archaeological methods and professional practice. Students will engage in discussions
and will work together to complete short activities.
IV. Tentative Course Schedule: * Required article **This syllabus represents my current plans and
objectives. As we go through the semester, those plans may need to change to enhance the class learning
opportunity. Such changes, communicated clearly, are not unusual and should be expected.

V. My Assumptions
        I approach this course with the assumption that most students have no prior background
in archaeology, and that most are taking the course to fulfill a university curriculum requirement
or to explore a curiosity about archaeology. I try to teach with this in mind, so I focus the
content on basic facts and concepts, as well as a discussion of key sites and controversies. For
me, one of the most important things about archaeology is that the story of the human past is still
being discovered, so I try to teach this class in a way that helps students to know how we know
what we know, and how we might learn more in the future.
VI. Course Requirements:
        1.   Attendance and participation policy:
On-time attendance for the entire lecture is required, and is part of your course grade (see
section VII below). Class meetings will review required readings, present new information, and
evaluate student mastery of assigned readings. Lab attendance is required, and any student who
misses more than four labs, regardless of performance in the rest of the class, will automatically
receive an F in the class. Respect is a central expectation for lectures and labs. This means
appropriate use of technology and refraining from distracting or disruptive behavior. Laptops
                                                   4


and tablets are permitted in the lecture hall for note-taking and taking quizzes in Squarecap.
Please limit your device use to class activities. Mobile phones should be switched off or into
silent mode, and should not be used in the classroom. Appropriate use of technology
communicates respect for other students and for the instructor; failure to do so may result in you
being asked to leave the lecture.
         Religious Holy Days
         By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
         observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a
         project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work
         within a reasonable time after the absence.
         2.   Course Readings/Materials: Almost all course readings will come from one required
              book, which should be available from the Co-op:
Scarre, Chris, ed. 2018. The Human Past, 4th edition. Thames and Hudson. This is a world
prehistory text that will be read alongside class lectures.
In addition to the required book, the following articles are required readings for the course.
These are freely available through UT’s electronic journals subscriptions, and if possible, a pdf
file of each reading will be placed on Canvas prior to the class meeting. Students are responsible
for accessing these readings.
         Dillehay, Tom D., Duccio Bonavia, Steve L. Goodbred, Jr., Mario Pino, Victor Vásquez,
and Teresa Rosales Tham. A Late Pleistocene Human Presence at Huaca Prieta, Peru, and Early
Pacific Coastal Adaptations. Quaternary Research 77(3):418-423.
         Gignoux, Christopher R., Brenna M. Henn, and Joanna L. Mountain. 2011. Rapid,
Global Demographic Expansions after the Origins of Agriculture. Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences 108(15):6044-6049.
         Jolie, Edward A., Thomas F. Lynch, Phil R. Geib, and J. M. Adovasio. 2011. Cordage,
Textiles, and the Late Pleistocene Peopling of the Andes. Current Anthropology 52(2):285-296.
         Neff, Hector. 2011. Evolution of the Mesoamerican Mother Culture. Ancient
Mesoamerica 22(1):107-122.
Squarecap: This course will use Squarecap (www.squarecap.com) to administer in-class quizzes
and evaluate attendance. Each student will need to purchase a subscription by the end of the trial
period for the software. Students should report any technical problems with the software to a TA
at the end of the class when the issue arises.
         3.   Assignments, Assessment, and Evaluation
Lab Work: Because most lab work is collaborative, there are no extensions or make-ups for
missed labs. Students must protect lab equipment and teaching collections and use them based
on instructions given during the lab orientation. Labs are required to pass the class.
Make-Up Exams: Ordinarily, there are no make-ups for exams. If you anticipate missing a class
for a valid reason, it is your responsibility to speak with your TA or with the professor in
advance about alternative arrangements. You should bring documentation of your reason for
                                                            5


missing class so that we can determine whether a make-up is warranted. Please feel free to
redact sensitive personal information (e.g., medical diagnosis, SSN) from your documentation.
Final Exam: There is no final exam for this course
Grade Issues: If you feel that your work has been evaluated inaccurately or unfairly, it is your
responsibility to bring this to the attention of your TA within one week after your graded work is
returned to you or posted on Canvas. Please review your graded work when it is returned or
posted, and let us know if you feel that there are any problems.
        4.   Use of Canvas in class: This class uses Canvas for a number of Web-based course
             management functions. Canvas can be accessed at http://canvas.utexas.edu/. The
             university provides support and tutorials for interested students—it is your
             responsibility to learn and access the site in order to prepare for classes, labs, and
             exams. For this course, Canvas will be used primarily as a place to post the course
             syllabus, slides from lectures, exam review sheets, required journal articles, and lab
             assignments.
        5.   Use of Squarecap in class: This class uses Squarecap to administer and evaluate in-
             class quizzes and to assess individual attendance. Squarecap can be accessed via
             https://squarecap.com/, and you will need to purchase a subscription. You must be
             present in the lecture hall for your quiz performance and attendance to be counted.
             Using another student’s Squarecap account will be considered a violation of the
             Honor Code, and both students will be sanctioned.
        6.   This class is using the Lectures Online recording system. This system records the
             audio and video material presented in class for you to review after class. Links for the
             recordings will appear in the Lectures Online tab on the Canvas page for this class.
             You will find this tab along the left side navigation in Canvas. To review a recording,
             simply click on the Lectures Online navigation tab and follow the instructions
             presented to you on the page. You can learn more about how to use the Lectures
             Online system at http://sites.la.utexas.edu/lecturesonline/. Although my intent is to
             make all lectures available, please note that there are sometimes technical difficulties
             that prevent this optional service from working as planned. Additional information
             about the lecture capture system is at: http://sites.la.utexas.edu/lecturesonline/.
VII. Grading Procedures: Grades will be based on:
                 (a) Lecture Attendance (10%). On-time attendance is required at class lectures,
        and will be assessed using the Squarecap app. You need to be in the classroom and
        logged into Squarecap on the UT wi-fi, or you will be flagged as absent. Each student
        may miss three classes during the term without a deduction to the attendance grade.
                 (b) Lab Assignments (30%). Lab activities will include discussions, exercises,
        and mini-projects taking place across campus. Some work will be assessed based on
        individual performance, and other work will be graded based on group completion of an
        assignment. We will drop your lowest lab score when calculating your final lab grade.
                  (c) Exams (3) (20% each, or 60%). The course lecture will be organized into
        three units, each of which will end with an in-class exam. The exam will consist of
        multiple choice questions (n=30) drawn from the Squarecap quizzes administered at the
        start of each lecture, as well as two one-page written responses to questions presented in
                                                    6


      the lectures. A review sheet will be posted a week in advance with a list of possible
      written response questions.
Grade Scale:                       B-: 80.00-82.99                     D: 63.00-66.99

VIII. Academic Integrity
University of Texas Honor Code
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
      “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of
      the University and uphold academic integrity.”
This means that work you produce on assignments, tests and exams is all your own work, unless
it is assigned as group work. I will make it clear for each test, exam or assignment whether
collaboration is encouraged or not.
Always cite your sources. If you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used
in previous class), you must make that clear otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and
subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course.
You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty Policy which can be found at
the following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Lab Work: Students will work together on group projects during their lab meetings, and the
group size and nature of the collaboration will be stated in the assignment. Students may only
collaborate with members of their group on lab assignments, unless expressly granted permission
to do otherwise by the TA. Copying lab work by members of other groups constitutes a violation
of the Honor Code. Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another
student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for
the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the
course and University disciplinary action.
Study and Review: Students are encouraged to work in small study groups to prepare for class
meetings and to discuss course materials prior to exams. Students should prepare their own
notes and review materials, and may NOT use materials prepared by others. Notes may NOT be
circulated (via social media or other means) without prior permission from the professor.
Copying the notes or review materials produced by another student will be considered a violation
of the Honor Code by both students.
Exams: NO form of collaboration or copying is permitted during exams, and no outside
materials may be consulted during exams without the express permission of the professor.
Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare papers,
copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any such behavior during the exam will result in a
score of 0 for the assignment, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary
action.
                                               7


IX. Other University Notices and Policies
Excused Absences for University Extracurricular Activities
Students participating in an officially sanctioned, scheduled University extracurricular activity
should be given the opportunity to make up class assignments or other graded assignments
missed as a result of their participation. It is the responsibility of the student to make
arrangements with the instructor prior to any missed scheduled examination lab for making up
the work.
 Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence to Students
    •   All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student
         notification policy. It is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to
         changes in his or her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent
         and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related communications,
         recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-
         mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this
         policy and instructions for updating your e-mail address are available at
         http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564.
Documented Disability Statement
Students with a documented disability may request appropriate academic accommodations from
the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities,

If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs or Professors, call
BCAL (the Behavior Concerns Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous. If
something doesn’t feel right – it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.
Q drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-
drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are
only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more
information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop   
Emergency Evacuation Policy
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus
Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when an alarm or alert is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting
and assembling outside, unless told otherwise by an official representative.
                                                     8


      •   Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
          Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
          building.
