Course description:
Enhancing French Skills is an advanced intermediate course that continues the development of
your communication abilities in French by practicing the four basic skills of speaking, listening,
writing and reading. In this course, you will expand your knowledge of the French language and
culture through the daily use of authentic documents, such as songs, cultural readings,
interviews, videos, and websites. This course fulfills the prerequisite requirements for French
320E and 324L. Prerequisite: French 611C.

     •  Canvas
     •  Course packet (available under each Theme in Modules)

The Lower-Division Grading Scale for French is the following:
                       89-87 B+           79-77 C+             69-67 D+
 97-93 A
                       86-83 B            76-73 C              66-63 D
 92-90 A-
                       82-80 B-           72-70 C-             62-60 D-
                                                               Less than 60 F
You must receive a grade of a C or higher (73% or higher) in order to continue on to FR
320E. A grade of a C- is not sufficient to continue on to FR 320E.
Assignments and evaluations:
Regular attendance online, daily preparation and persistent, active participation in class are
essential to your success in learning French. This includes joining class ON TIME (all times are
in the Central Time Zone). Your teacher will assign specific exercises to be turned in online. No
late homework will be accepted without previous approval from your professor.
You can also expect regular quizzes. These quizzes will be available on Canvas for a limited
period of time. You will receive a zero for a missed quiz.
Online oral assessments (submitted via Canvas) will take place following Thèmes1, 2, 3, and 4.
Your instructor will provide you with more details. The oral assessments will very closely
reflect the daily in-class activities.
Exams:


FIVE chapter exams will be given in 317. These will contain a variety of listening, reading, and
writing exercises. Please note exam dates indicated on the syllabus. The exams will be timed,
and you will have 60 minutes to complete each one. Exams will be administered outside of class
time, to provide maximum schedule flexibility. We will have only one hour of class on exam
days in order to free up an hour for you to take your exam.
Final Oral Exam:
For the final oral exam, which will take place at the end of the semester, you will have a
conversation with another student from our class in Zoom. You will record your conversation.
This culminating activity will count as 10% of your final grade. A separate information sheet
will be available to you with more details toward the end of the semester. Just keep in mind that
the communicative activities in class have been preparing you all semester long for this.
Classroom Expectations:
Even though courses will be given via Zoom, all students are expected to assist in maintaining a
classroom environment that is conducive to learning. Inappropriate behavior (making offensive
remarks, harassment or bullying of the instructor or other students, etc.) will be addressed by the
instructor. Repeated inappropriate or disruptive behavior will be reported to the Dean of Students
and will very quickly escalate into a judicial matter.
Syllabus
BEFORE class each day, PREPARE everything your instructor has assigned in the document
called Devoirs in Modules under each Thème.

Disabilities:


The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office
of the Dean of Students at 471-6259 or 471-4641, or go
to http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd (Links to an external site.)
Code of conduct: The dean may initiate disciplinary proceedings under subchapter 11-300
against a student who conducts himself or herself in a manner that impedes, interferes with, or
disrupts any University teaching, research, administrative, disciplinary, public service, learning,
or other authorized activity. For more information and a complete list of Student Standards of
Conduct, please consult http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi08-09/app/gi08.appc03.html -
subchapter-11-300-initiation-of- disciplinary-proceedings (Links to an external site.).
Scholastic dishonesty:
Scholastic dishonesty on any graded assignment will result in a zero. Scholastic dishonesty
includes any kind of cheating. In language classes, this includes the use of online translators. Be
aware that scholastic dishonesty can have far-reaching consequences, and can result in
suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information, contact the Student Judicial
Services at 471- 2841, or go http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis.php (Links to an
external site.)
Religious holidays:
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence
as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable
time after the absence. If these procedures are followed, students will not be penalized. Students
are only excused for the actual holiday, and not surrounding days. For example, if a holiday falls
on a Thursday, the student will be excused for Thursday’s absence, but not for an absence on the
Friday following the holiday.
