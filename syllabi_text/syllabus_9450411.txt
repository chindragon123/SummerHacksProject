Course Title: Quranic Arabic
Prefix: ARA 360L
Instructor: Mohammad A. Mohammad
Semester: Spring 2019
We begin by reviewing the core concepts of Arabic grammar by studying principles of ​iʔraab
and apply grammatical rules to verses in the Qur’aan.
We study in some depth some interesting aspects of the Noble Qur’a-fan. We explore word order
and its many functions in Quranic texts. Focus will be placed on meaningful particles by
examining the three most productive particles: ​baaʔ, laam, and al-.​ We explore the Quranic art
of story-telling and narration. Particular attention will be paid to the form and the use of
al-ʔsmaaʔ al-ɦusnaa​ and their different positions in verses. Some issues pertaining to tense and
aspect are examined. We also compare different books of ​tafseer​ by comparing different ​tafseers
of specific verses. ​ʔiʕraab​ ​will be present in all classes.
The course is totally conducted in Arabic.
