Course overview and objectives: This is a first course that emphasizes understanding and creating
proofs; therefore, it must provide a transition from the problem-solving approach of calculus to the en-
tirely rigorous approach of advanced courses such as M365C or M373K. The number of topics required
for coverage has been kept modest so as to allow instructors adequate time to concentrate on developing
the students theorem-proving skills. See tentative schedule below for the list of topics.
Text: personal notes available for free on my webpage (for content and exercises). Other recommended
(but not required) textbooks are:
    • Number theory through inquiry, by D. Marshall, E. Odell and M. Starbird. This is a must-have if
       you are serious about mathematical/critical thinking. It will guide you and help you develop the
       theory by yourself, and, in my opinion, that’s the best way to truly learn math. Unfortunately, we
       don’t have the time to follow its pace in the summer.
    • Elementary number theory and its applications, by K. Rosen. This is the standard textbook adopted
       by UT. It does not have any prerequisites, and it has a good selection of standard exercises.
    • 250 problems in elementary number theory, by W. Sierpinski. As the name suggests, you only get
       exercises, but wait for it... *drum roll*... they all come with solutions! This means you get to
       check your answers, or get hints (if you can control yourself and not read the full answer), and,
       most importantly, be exposed to mathematical writing (try to emulate this style). It’s a great
       selection of problems, ranging from straightforward to research-level questions (those are marked
       with an asterisk). I will let you know which ones I expect you to be able to do. Most problems on
       our exams are going to be on the same style/level of those problems.
    • A classical introduction to modern number theory, by K. Ireland and M. Rosen. First, this is not
       the same Rosen as above. Also, you should know some number theory before you read it, so it
       is not good as a standard textbook for an introductory course. Why am I mentioning it then?
       Because I really like it and I love the selection of topics there, and this is a must have if you want
       to continue studying number theory after this course.
Prerequisites: M325K or M341 with a grade of at least C.

Letter grades: All grades will be recorded in Canvas. Attendance will not be taken and it will not be
used in the computation of your grade, but I highly recommend attending classes to excel in this class.
Partial numerical grades are not rounded. The final numerical average (whose computation is described
in the next two sections) is rounded up and computed on a scale from 0 to 100, to one decimal place.
Your final letter grade will be converted from your final numerical average using a scale not stricter than
the following:
                    A:   92.6 − 100                                       C:  72.6 − 76.5
                  A− :   89.6 − 92.5                                     C− : 69.6 − 72.5
                  B+ :   86.6 − 89.5                                     D+ : 66.6 − 69.5
                    B:   82.6 − 86.5                                      D:  62.6 − 66.5
                  B− :   79.6 − 82.5                                     D− : 59.6 − 62.5
                  C+ :   76.6 − 79.5                                      F:  0 − 59.5
Assignments and exams:
   1. Homework: weekly. Homework always becomes available on Wednesday and it’s due 8 days later
      on a Thursday (except for the first week of class, when it becomes available on Monday and it is
      due 4 days later on Friday; it’s a very short set though). No late homework will be accepted. There
      will be a total of 5 assigned homework sets. Your homework average (HA) will be the arithmetic
      mean of your 4 highest homework grades.
   2. Midterm: there will be one take-home midterm. It will become available on 07/31 and it will be
      due one week later on 08/07. There is no makeup for the midterm. If I do not receive a hard copy
      of your midterm by the deadline, your midterm grade (MG) will be 0.
   3. Final: on 08/17. The final exam is cumulative and you should expect about 1/3 of it to be over
      material covered after the midterm. You will have 3 hours (180 minutes) to finish the final. No
      calculators or electronic devices will be allowed but you can bring one A4 sheet of notes. There
      will be no makeup for the final. If you miss the final, your final exam grade (FG) will be 0.
   4. Bonus points: at the end of some classes, I might give an extra problem that will be due the next
      day. If you get them right, you will be rewarded with a bonus point that will be added to your
      final grade. If you get them wrong or choose not to do them, you will not be penalized for it. It’s
      your responsibility to copy the question during class or get it from a friend. I will not announce
      the problems via email. The total number of bonus points will be denoted by (BP)
Grade calculation: With the notation from the previous section, the default final numerical average
(FNA) will be computed as follows:
                              FNA = 0.2 (HA) + 0.3 (MG) + 0.5 (FG) + (BP).
                                                       2


    Academic Dishonesty: Academic dishonesty of any kind will not be tolerated, and is punished to
the fullest extent allowed by university policy.
    Students with Disabilities: Upon request, The University of Texas at Austin provides appropriate
academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Of-
fice of the Dean of Students at 512-471-6259, 512-471-4641 TTY. If you plan on using accommodations,
please notify me early in the semester.
    Mental Health Services: The Counseling and Mental Health Center is located on the fifth floor of
the Student Services Building (SSB), with hours M-F 8AM-5PM, and may be reached at 512-471-3515
(appointments) and 512-471-CALL (crisis line).
    Religious Holidays: Per university policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least
fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holiday. You will be given an opportunity to
complete any missed work within a reasonable amount of time after the absence.
    08/02: Last day an undergraduate student may change registration in a second-term class to or from
the pass/fail basis or credit/no credit basis.
    08/16: Last day to drop a second-term or whole session class.
Proof writing tips:
    • Please, avoid words such as “trivial”, “obvious”, “straightforward”, or expressions such as “it is
       easy to see that...”. If it is easy to prove something, then it should be easy and it shouldn’t take
       long for you to write the argument for it! Also, it helps me give you partial credit.
    • Please, use proper grammar. The purpose of a proof is to convince the reader that a claim is true.
       If the reader can’t understand your sentences, then they can’t be convinced! Ask a friend to read
       your proofs, and see if they can understand your sentences.
    • Please, make sure the reader knows your notation. You can’t talk about an object x if you don’t
       tell the reader what x stands for! That’s why you see a lot of sentences such as “let x be (...)” in
       mathematical writing.
    • Please, try to use suggestive notation. If you have two sets X and Y , then it is a good idea to use
       the letter x for elements of X and the letter y for elements of Y . Compare saying “let x ∈ X and
       y ∈ Y ” with saying “let x1 ∈ X and x2 ∈ Y ”.
    • When writing a proof, if you ask yourself “do I need to prove this?”, then you might have to prove
       it, so maybe go ahead and prove it. Developing this “is this good enough”-meter is part of what
       you will learn in this course and in other proof-based classes. In fact, even when you are writing
       papers, you will face those questions, and that’s ok!
