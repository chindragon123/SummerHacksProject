FARE . FORM. FABRICATION: SUSTAINED CYCLES IN COOKING + CONSTRUCTION
This studio will investigate the relationship between food, academics, and construction techniques,
particularly steel structures, manifest in a multifaceted contextual urban building. All research and work
in the studio will be toward a single primary project, paced throughout the course of semester:
COURSE DESCRIPTION
INTEGRATIVE STUDIO is a comprehensive studio. Projects are expected to address the full range of
potential issues embodied in an architectural design; however, aspects that directly impact how projects
exist in the physical environment, including site relationships and materiality/construction, will be a
particular concentration. Therefore, the studio will have a strong focus on the design implications of
technical issues, particularly their potential for design generation and as a repository of meaning. In
addition, the thoughtful design and craftsmanship of presentation documents at all phases and scales
will be emphasized.
Issues of construction and assemblies are framed within a set of concerns that are present in any type
of construction, such as expansion & contraction, moisture infiltration and evacuation, ventilation,
primary and secondary structure, logic of connections, differential settlement, etc. Particular attention
will be given to the nature of detail drawings and the final product produced by the students will result in
a presentation package that will be comprehensive in content and scale.
Projects are expected to engage the socially current topic of food systems and their relevant
sustainability or lack thereof.
Students will work in SELF-SELECTED TEAMS of two [teams of one or three students will be
considered] throughout the semester. The studio begins with a short research phase intended to
generate initial attitudes toward program, site, and construction for the comprehensive project that
follows.


PROJECT PROGRAM
The project program is a hypothetical College of Culinary Arts on the campus of The University of Texas
at Austin. The project addresses diverse and multi-scaled infrastructures which have direct connections
to larger networks yet must operate integrally with local cultures and environments. The challenge is to
strengthen academic, public, private, and informal interests and transform the approach to campus
structures and higher education learning. Issues of scale, identity, site, in addition to tectonic
considerations such as structural and material logic will be examined with thorough sets of drawings
and models. The projects will be instruments of urban transformation, and viewed as catalytic examples
with potential to project an alternative model for campus, city, and urban environments.
STEEL: As a building material, there is nothing particularly new or original about using steel. Iron has
been used since the 19th Century, which evolved into steel alloys, and steel, along with other metal
alloys, are still being refined to increase performance and bring down costs. Mies van der Rohe and
Walter Gropius championed steel as a lightweight structural material to enable long spans and an
industrial aesthetic, and others such as Charles and Ray Eames used steel for its building efficiency and
economies of scale. In terms of ecology, one positive aspect about metals is their capacity for
recycling – steel is the most recycled material in the world. The studio will investigate the role of steel in
the construction industry as well as in everyday life, including cooking, to develop innovative design
methods for structural steel.
The project will take on the parameters of food preparation and education, the cultural underpinnings
which drive these methods, and enabling research to address local and global food issues. By
examining the technological and physical ramifications of food, education, business, and its future in the
city, the studio will explore ways that food can be intelligently incorporated in buildings in a productive
and synergistic fashion. Studio designs will embody both the complex organizational logic of the
campus and city, and the spatial and formal specificity of a building with a unique program.


SITE
Each student team will design their scheme on a selected site on campus, adjacent to the Main Building and UT Tower.
Each design will be expected to operate within the Campus Masterplan, while also offering something “new” and enhancing
the campus. A portion of the proposed site is currently a surface parking lot, and this transformation aligns with the larger
vision of a car-free campus. Projects are expected to both draw upon and contribute to the vitality of campus.
*Specific course assignments will more clearly define expectations for site research, constraints, and opportunities.

TOTAL BUILDING AREA [+/- 25,000 GROSS SF]


STUDIO COURSE GRADING POLICY
Establishing grades for projects of a creative nature is a more complex matter than grading in other academic areas. While each project
contains certain quantifiable elements by which it may be evaluated, a significant portion of each grade is derived from a broader, more
subjective set of issues.
Grading for studio courses is broken into three components:
      1.     GRASP (the ideas and understanding of the project at hand, combined with an appropriate process of inquiry),
      2.     PROCESS (the consistent and rigorous development and testing of ideas)
      3.     RESOLUTION (the demonstration of competence, completeness, and finesse through representation).
Your work will be evaluated on its rigor and evolution over the semester.
GRADE DESCRIPTIONS
A : OUTSTANDING WORK
Project surpasses expectations in terms of inventiveness, appropriateness, verbal and visual ability, conceptual rigor, craft, and personal
development. Student pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. Project is complete on all levels.
B : GOOD WORK
Project is thorough, well researched, diligently pursued, and successfully completed. Student pursues ideas and suggestions presented in
class and puts in effort to resolve required projects. Project is complete on all levels and demonstrates potential for excellence.
C : REQUIRED WORK
Project meets the minimum requirements. Suggestions made in class are not pursued with dedication or rigor. Project is incomplete in one or
more areas.
D : POOR WORK
Project is incomplete. Basic skills including graphic skills, model-making skills, verbal clarity or logic of presentation are not level-appropriate.
Student does not demonstrate the required design skill and knowledge base.
F : UNACCEPTABLE WORK
Project is unresolved. Minimum objectives are not met. Performance is not acceptable. Note that this grade will be assigned when you
have excessive unexcused absences.
X : (EXCUSED INCOMPLETE)
Can be given only for legitimate reasons of illness or family emergency. Simply not completing work on time is not an adequate cause for
assigning this evaluation. It may only be used after consultation with the Associate Deans’ offices and with an agreement as to a new
completion date. Studio work must be completed before the second week of the next design semester in which you are enrolling, according to
School of Architecture policy.
ALL GRADES ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIONS FOR ABSENCES, LATE WORK AND LATE ARRIVALS.


RECOMMENDATIONS
Professor Fajkus is willing to write recommendations for students who have showed consistent diligence, work ethic, and
ability in the studio. Please provide two weeks of advance notice.
METHODOLOGY
The primary subjects of the studio are the design potentials of techniques of building and siting. While students will be
expected to produce exquisitely crafted documents of their design proposals at the site, building, and detail scales, specific
software tools will not be dictated.
General material and format considerations will be suggested by the instructor throughout the course, however, investigation
and experimentation is strongly encouraged at all stages of production and design. In addition to digital production methods,
portions of the studio process will include hand sketches and drawings as well as physical models; students should equip
their studio workspace appropriately.
COLLABORATION
Projects are developed in collaboration with a partner, and your performance will be evaluated collectively. You should be
mindful of the ‘give and take’ that is associated with a collaborative design process. If the relationship between you and your
partner becomes strained in any way it is imperative that you bring such issues to the attention of your instructors. In addition
to the specific relation you will have with you partner, a general spirit of collaboration amongst all members of the studio will
be expected.
ATTENDANCE
Punctual and regular attendance is mandatory. Students are expected to work on their project in the studio. Active
participation in studio readings and discussions is expected. One unexcused absence during the term of the semester will be
forgiven. Absences after the first will impact the final grade for the course. Students with three unexcused absences may be
dropped from the course without further notice. The minimum penalty for more than three unexcused absences is a full letter
drop in your final grade for the course.
Excused absences are given for illness or family emergencies only. Any other absences constitute unexcused absences, even
if prior notice is given to the instructor.
A student who misses classes or other required activities for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the
instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within
a reasonable time after the absence. A student who fails to complete missed work within the time allowed will be subject to
the normal academic penalties.
DISABILITIES
At the beginning of the semester, students with disabilities who need special accommodations should notify the instructor by
presenting a letter prepared by the Services for Students with Disabilities Office. To ensure that the most appropriate
accommodations can be provided, students should contact the SSD Office at 471-6259 or 471-4641 TTY.
SECURITY, SAFETY AND THE STUDIO
The studio is an exceptional learning environment. Since it is a place for all, it necessitates the careful attention to the needs
of everyone in it. Please see your instructor if there are any problems (music, visual pollution) that you are unable to resolve
on your own. All spraying of fixative, spray paint or any other substance should be done in the shop. Security is a
necessary component for a studio that is accessible to you and your colleagues 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Please be
mindful not to admit any uninvited visitors and keep all exterior doors locked after hours.
SOFTWARE
Adobe software is often used in this course. When accessing Adobe software in SOA computer labs, you will be prompted to
sign in with an Adobe ID. You are not required to purchase Creative Cloud services to sign in on our lab computers, but you
are required to create a free Adobe ID. That can be done here: https://accounts.adobe.com/
