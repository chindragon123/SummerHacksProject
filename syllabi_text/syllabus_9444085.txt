COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course surveys the 550 years prior to the establishment of British rule in India.
The large states which emerged in this period -- the Delhi Sultanate, the Vijayanagara
kingdom of South India, and the Mughal empire -- incorporated regions of South Asia
that had previously been politically divided and thereby stimulated the circulation of
ideas, peoples, and goods throughout the subcontinent and beyond. On the one hand,
the diversity of South Asian culture and society increased during the timespan from
1200 to 1750, with the influx of peoples and religions of foreign origin. At the same
time, the increased scale of political, social, and economic networks led to greater
uniformity and communication. The roots of contemporary South Asia -- an area that is
distinctly different from other parts of the world yet also internally divided -- thus lie in
the precolonial era.
The first objective of the course is to acquaint students with the basic framework of what
happened in the subcontinent between 1200 and 1750. A second objective is to
familiarize students with the historiographic issues that are still under debate. Students
can expect to enhance their ability to grasp large-scale historical processes and to conduct
close analysis of primary source materials from the past. The course format combines
lectures by the instructor with active participation by students in group discussion.
Students will be exposed to both textual and visual sources from the period.
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
NOTE that this syllabus is subject to change; all changes will be announced in class and
on the course Canvas website.
ASSIGNED READING
1) C. Asher & C. Talbot, India before Europe (must purchase at Co-op or elsewhere)
2) Banarsidas, Ardhakathanak: A Half Story, trans. Rohini Chowdhury (on Canvas)
3) a variety of short readings, mainly primary sources, posted on Canvas.
4) several websites on built environments of Delhi & Vijayanagara, also Mughal art
                                                                                              1


REQUIREMENTS & GRADING
         Students will read several translations of original sources, in addition to the
textbook, and explore websites detailing the architecture of old Delhi and Vijayanagara
(Hampi). These literary and visual texts will be discussed at four discussion sessions, at
which attendance is mandatory. Every student will take a leading role in one discussion
session during the semester, which will entail not only vigorous participation but also the
written submission of two discussion questions accompanied by a paragraph-long
justification. The assigned readings will form the basis of two short papers (4-6 pages
apiece) on topics provided by the instructor. To broaden the range of primary sources
covered, we will also have three material culture sessions devoted to religious sites,
paintings, and trade-related objects or sites, respectively. Every student will have to
contribute to one of the three session by choosing a relevant item (site, painting, or
object) to present to the class in a brief written report. In addition, there will be two
examinations consisting of both short ID and long essay questions. Attendance and
participation will be considered in determining the final grade, as well.
         Various aspects of student performance will be weighted as listed below in
determining the final grade for the course:
         two exams                                              50%
         two short papers (1200-1500 words each)                35%
         1 report on site or object (300 words)                  5%
         discussion questions & justifications                   5%
         attendance & participation                              5%
 Grading scale. A 93-100; A- 90-92; B+ 87-89; B 83-86; B- 80-82; C+ 77-79; C 73-76;
C- 70-72; D+ 67-69; D 63-66; D- 60-62; F 59 or lower.
COURSE POLICIES
The course website on Canvas will be used to post readings, assignments, and grades, as
well as announcements relating to the course – plan on checking the site regularly. It is
your responsibility to maintain a functioning email account linked to Canvas. You are
welcome to email me at any time – I will do my best to return your email promptly.
However, complex issues (or questions about grades) can be dealt with much more
effectively in person.
Smartphones should never be taken out of your daypack, pocket, or purse. Laptop use is
allowed, but only for educational purposes. Your attention should be fixed on what is
going on in the classroom at all times, especially when your fellow class members are
talking. Infringement of these rules is subject to a grade penalty, to be applied at the
instructor’s discretion.
Please be prepared to complete assignments on the specified days, unless you are ill or
have another documented excuse. In order to encourage you to do so, I reserve the right
to apply a grade penalty for late assignments (equivalent to approximately one letter
                                                                                           2


grade per week) as well as for unexcused absences. However, if you are having difficulty
with the course or must be absent for a period due to personal issues, please stop by
during my office hours or be in touch by email. Don’t wait until weeks have passed and
it’s too late to catch up. Keep in touch!
Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. By UT
Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class session with
assigned work in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity
to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
“As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of
the University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at
UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in
previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism
and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are
responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code
which can be found at the following web address:
