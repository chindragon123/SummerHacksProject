Description
This survey course considers Latin American music within a broad cultural and historical
framework. Latin American musical practices are explored by illustrating the many ways
that aesthetics and society are embodied in and negotiated through performance. Our
discussions will be framed by a range of concepts pertinent in Latin American contexts
such as diaspora, colonialism, mestizaje, hybridity, migration, and globalization.
The course carries a Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or
present.
Readings
One textbook has been ordered for the course, Musics of Latin America (W.W. Norton,
2012); it is available for purchase in the Coop, and several copies have been placed on
reserve in the Fine Arts Library. In addition, a few assigned readings have been
assembled from others sources. These are available through the course Canvas site.
Listening
Students are asked to listen to musical examples each week and will be responsible for
recognizing and identifying them on exams; approximately three songs per lecture will be


                                                        Music of Latin America syllabus, p. 2
assigned and should be reviewed before class. You will be asked to remember something
about the histories, contexts, and meanings of the assigned music. Listening can be
downloaded from the Canvas site for our class.
Consider making notes that include the following information as you review to the
assigned music:
        —The title of the piece and the composer, if known
        —The approximate time it was written, within a decade
        —The culture area/country with which it is associated
        —The lyrics of the piece, what they discuss
        —The instrumentation of the piece
        —The typical contexts in which it is performed
        —The formal musical characteristics that define it
        —Any broader issues discussed that relate to the piece
Grading Policy
Students are required to attend classes and labs, to keep up with the reading and listening
and respond to readings on Canvas posts, to participate actively in discussion, to take
exams on the assigned day, and to complete all assignments punctually. Grades for
undergraduates will be determined on the basis of three in-class exams, other small
assignments (a concert review, weekly postings to Canvas), a final brief oral
presentation, class participation, and attendance. Out of approximately 450 total points,
the three exams will constitute 60% of the student’s overall grade, the minor assignments
15% (postings 10%, concert review 5%), the oral presentation 10%, attendance 10%, and
class participation 5%.
        In-class exams for students will consist of three parts: (1) the identification of key
terms, ideas, or people; (2) discussion of assigned listening examples; and (3) a short
essay on a topic related to class discussion. Students will be provided with a review sheet
prior to a given test that lists key terms they are to be responsible for and possible essay
topics. The essay will be evaluated in terms of the following five categories: clear
organization, clear grammar/syntax, reference to assigned musical examples in support of
arguments, use of relevant musical terminology from readings or class discussion, and
full response to all aspects of the question posed.
        Undergraduates may opt to write an 8-10 pp. paper instead of taking one of the
midterm exams or the final. If they choose the paper option, they should refer to the
writing guidelines below for graduate students. Those planning to write a paper should
provide the instructor and TA with a proposed topic and bibliography no later than week
5, and an outline by week 7.
Concert Reviews
As noted above, one written concert review is required of all students. The review should
be 3 or 4 pages in length, typed and double-spaced. The overall goal of the assignment is
that you experience music making live and develop an appropriate vocabulary with
which to describe/discuss it. Please consult at least two written sources (at least one from
the Fine Arts Library or online academic databases in addition to class readings) in order
to acquire background information on the styles of music heard at the concert; they
should be formally cited in the review. You should also try to conduct a brief interview
with one of the performers following the event and incorporate what you learn from them
into your review. See the “Extra Credit Options” section below about concerts for a
listing of possible events to attend. Other concerts may be appropriate but require
approval in advance from either the Instructor or TA. Please hand in your review no later
than Tuesday of Week 15 unless special arrangements are made with the instructor.


                                                        Music of Latin America syllabus, p. 3
Class Presentations
You will prepare a final class presentation on Latin American music in a small group
(usually 2-4 students) by researching a particular musical artist, genre, or national or
regional musical style of your choice. The collective presentation should take about 15
minutes, with distinct segments presented by everyone in the group. Some portion of the
presentation should discuss music per se: instruments, sounds, rhythms, etc., and the
remainder should address topics such as historical background, contemporary social
meanings, changes in style, accompanying dance, etc.
        The presentation should be accompanied by visual aids on Powerpoint or
Keynote. These files should be given to the TA at the class meeting prior to the
presentation so that they can be uploaded to a single computer. The talk may also include
audio examples: recorded music, youtube video, or other sources (please also send these
to the TA ahead of time as appropriate). Up to three minutes may be devoted to playing
music. The presentations will be evaluated based on the following categories: clear
organization, clear focus/framing of central issues, appropriate use of AV, incorporation
of musical analysis/discussion, and staying within time constraints.
Attendance
Regular attendance is important because various activities that take place in class (the
screening of video clips, musical demonstrations or performance opportunities, collective
discussion, guest presentations, and so on) cannot be experienced through individual
work at home. The same is true for attendance in discussion section. For that reason,
attendance in both is mandatory. Attendance will be assigned approximately 45 points
(10% of overall possible points), and after the first 3 unexcused absences by a given
student each absence will result in 3 lost points.
Class participation
This grade will be based on meaningful participation in collective discussions.
Meaningful participation is taken to be analytic engagement with the texts and course
themes. Each student is expected to come to class prepared to participate actively in class
discussions each week. Those students who take the initiative to engage critically with
the readings and themes of the class and actively participate by sharing their thoughts on
a regular basis will graded highly. Those who participate infrequently in class discussions
will be graded down.
Missed Test Policy
Students are required to keep track of scheduled test days on the syllabus and to take tests
when they are scheduled. Students missing tests without a medical excuse will not be
allowed to make them up, so please don’t forget to come.
Laptops, Tablets, Phones
While you may bring your electronic devices to class for the purposes of note-taking or
web browsing related to class activities, please do not abuse the privilege by using your
device to email, IM, text message, update your social media, or browse the web in ways
not related to class activity. It distracts your classmates and detracts from their learning
experience as well as yours. A student seen to be engaged in such activity will earn no
attendance credit for that day.
        Assignments for Graduate Students
        Graduate students who enroll in the course as MUS 380 will complete an
individual project on a topic of their choice that relates to course content, in addition to
their collective oral presentation. The individual project may consist of a performance
(learning a new piece of music), a composition, musical analysis, a transcription, a


                                                         Music of Latin America syllabus, p. 4
research paper, or any other project approved by the instructor. If written, individual
projects should be roughly 12-15 pp. in length, excluding notes and bibliography.
        In addition, graduate music students are required to complete two additional
tasks: First, they must transcribe and analyze approximately one minute’s worth of music
related to the class listening. This task may be incorporated into and/or support their final
project, or it may be separate. Second, they must learn to play and/or sing a
representative piece or rhythm of repertoire unfamiliar to them that relates to the course.
Again, this may be incorporated into to their final project or not, as they choose. Students
may demonstrate their performance skills to the class as part of final class presentations if
they wish.
        A two-page description/outline for the project and an accompanying bibliography
is due during week 5, and a draft of the project is due week 11. The final version of the
paper (assuming additional revisions are necessary) as well as the transcriptions and
recording of musical performance (in the case of graduate music students) will be due on
Tuesday of the last week of classes. This schedule will ensure that the instructor has time
to interact with you as you define the project and conduct your research. Graduate
students are welcome to combine the topic of their individual research paper and/or
musical transcriptions and performance work with their final class presentation.
        For graduates, the exams will constitute 25% of the overall grade, the final 15%,
the individual project 30%, the transcription and performance/recording 10%, the
postings/oral presentation 10%, and attendance 10%.
Extra Credit Options
Performance Ensembles. It is the intention of this course to encourage active
participation in musical experiences to the greatest extent possible. Therefore, any
student interested in enrolling and participating in a one-unit world music performance
ensemble at the University of Texas in conjunction with this course will have their lowest
test score raised to an A. If you decide to pursue this option, please notify your instructor
and TA as soon as possible. You will need to formally enroll in the ensemble by the 12     th
day of classes in order to receive credit.
