         Political Economy of Development in Postwar Korea
Spring 2020, ANS 361/ AAS 325
Instructor: Professor Youjeong Oh
Course Website: Canvas ANS 361
Course Description
This course will explore contemporary Korean society and culture during the post-Korean
War period. By reading texts about compressed modernity, developmental state, social
movements, gender politics, financial crisis and its aftermath, and globalization, this course
will address the tensions between industrialization, nationalism, authoritarianism,
democratization and neoliberalism in South Korea. At the same time, we will contemplate
contemporary South Korea in the global context by exploring such topics as Cold War
geopolitics, transnational migration and adoption, the globalization of Korean popular
culture, and K-pop tourism. It is a reading- and discussion-extensive course.
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Requirements
    1. Class attendance and Participation (10%). Class attendance is mandatory and will
       be checked regularly including the add/drop period. Students are allowed one

       by 2 points, up to a maximum of 10 points. The only exception to this policy is your
       health condition. In order for an absence to be considered excused, students must
       bring a doctor’s note or a letter from student emergency center. If you come to class
       5 minutes late or leave the classroom early, it will be considered as tardiness; three
       such occasions will be regarded as a full absence.

    3. Reading Response (20%). Students pick FIVE readings and post reading responses
       about the selected readings by 8pm the day before each class day on Canvas
       under Discussions. Reading responses (around 500 words for each reading) should
       discuss main points of each assigned reading and raise your own question(s) related
       to the topic Please sign-up for five preferred readings on Canvas under Discussions:
