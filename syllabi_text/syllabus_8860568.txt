Course Description
We live in a rapidly changing business environment. Marketing concepts that were relevant in
the past are no longer pertinent in solving great managerial matters. The new media setting and
the internet have definitely changed the way business people think and create. Today’s market
demands more of a “renaissance professional” than just a “specialized” one. Accordingly, this
course brings forward the integrated way of thinking; self-entrepreneurship, the big picture
insight of the organization, its problems, challenges and solutions, all in the context of brand
promotion. This Class will rely heavily on the case method. Each case analysis presents a
different set of integrated communication concepts that will be reviewed independently by the
students, their peers and in the classroom. Additionally, students will practice their presentation
skills and research abilities.
Overarching Goals and Objectives
    1) Intangible goals. This class has a unique structure. It offers an opportunity to develop: 1)
        your own creative way of thinking, while learning about decision making process, 2) who
        you are and what is important to you in the business setting, 3) sensitivity to worldly,
        business and ethical issues, and 4) communication skills and courage to express your
        ideas in a group dynamics and in front of an audience.
    2) Internalizing the Case method. In class, we will analyze “real life” business situations
        (aka, cases) that will prepare you as a professional in the field.
    3) Emphasizing and deepening understanding of some illusive marketing concepts such as
        branding.
    4) Developing a practical sense about your own business inclinations, entrepreneurship and
        desires.
                                                                                                    1


Teaching Methods and structure
The course will combine lecture, discussion, group work and presentation, individual
presentation and media.
The course begins with a short overview of the necessary tools in the field of brand promotion
and management (mostly a summary of your teachings in the program throughout the years). In
the first section of the semester Harvard Business Cases will be discussed in class by the
instructor and students. In the second part of the semester, students will be working on their own
business project, while focusing on business development as well as brand promotion. Overall,
the course is structured in a way that enables students the exciting opportunity to work on their
own business entrepreneurship, as well as communication research.
In general, my philosophy emanates from a deep/ spiritual outlook of business, marketing and
communication and thus the entire class will be guided based on that particular outlook.
Course Materials
A course packet is available for purchase at the University Co-op. Additional readings and
course material will be available through the PCL online resources, and/or will be distributed in
class. Due to the dynamic nature of the class and the possibility of guest speakers’
participation, readings and the actual course outline are subject to change. Students will be
held accountable for any changed reading material. In the event changes do occur, reading
assignments will be posted on Canvas prior to each class. It is the students’ responsibility to
check Canvas regularly and before each class.

Gaston Legorburu and Darren McColl (2014).
Assignments
The following section provides a brief summary of the course assignments; further explanations
will be provided by the instructor during the course of the semester.
    1) Business “from the soul” (team project): teams will be working on a business idea that
         is close to their heart and soul. The instructor will give further directions and information
         in class about the process of choosing the business ideas. Overall, teams will be working
         on promoting an original business idea and will present final solutions and brand
         promotion plan towards the end of the semester (comprised of a plan book +
         presentation).
    2) Phases’ presentations (team project): the business from the soul project is comprised of
         3 phases. Each team will present all three phases in class. Each phase takes you a step
         forward towards the completion of the business from the soul project.
                                                                                                      2


    3) Focus Group Team Presentation (team project): Teams will gain a hands-on
        experience, conducting focus group research. This research will assist you in advancing
        your “Business from the soul” project.
    4) Case presentation (team project): your team will be asked to present a case analysis in
        class! This includes, the case summary, the statement of the problem, suggested
        alternatives/or solutions, analysis of the data given in the case and finally a concise
        recommendation for action.
    5) Course Attendance: Students are expected to continuously attend, participate and
        contribute to class discussion. The instructor and TA will pay careful attention to the
        participation in class and to the quality of the arguments students make. Attendance will
        be maintained by the TA.
Evaluation
The following percentage breakdown will constitute your final grade. Final grades will be made

Religious Holy Days Observance Policy
The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student
from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of
a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused
under this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an
examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable
time after the absence. A student who misses classes or other required activities, including
examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in
advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an
assignment within a reasonable time after the
absence.http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi03-04/ch4/ch4g.html#attendance
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning
process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
