COURSE OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES:
Over the course of its history, advertising has solidified itself globally as a major economic and
cultural force. This course is designed to familiarize you with advertising’s rise to its position of
prominence. Our focus will be on understanding advertising’s development as a communication
tool, a cultural and economic phenomenon, and as a force that both constructs and reflects
society.
                                                                                                      1


This course has three main objectives. Using a historical frame of reference, we will spend the
semester exploring:
    1. What advertising can do and what advertising cannot do
    2. How advertising is a reflection of and a form of culture
    3. To what degree advertising is a pervasive form of communication
I have structured the course chronologically with an emphasis on specific themes, such as
gender or political engagement, as they pertain to particular points in the evolution of
advertising. While you will learn about the important people and dates that make up
advertising’s history, my aim is for you to understand these facts against the more interesting
and more important backdrop of how advertising is both a product and an agent of cultural
change.
COURSE METHOD
This five-week course is web-based and consists of online lectures, discussions, assignments
and tests. Most of the class is asynchronous, meaning you do not have to log on at a specific
day or time but can access the online material at a time that works for you. Most of the class is
self-directed. You will proceed through a series of topic modules. The modules are structured
sequentially, meaning you must finish one before moving on to the next. Each module must be
completed within a designated timeframe (three or four days), but you may complete the module
at your own pace and convenience within those three or four days. You can watch the videos at
any time that works for you within those days. The modules do not expire and can be viewed at
any time during the course.
Lectures
Each module will include mini online lectures. These lectures are designed to supplement the
material you’ve read in the book. I won’t spend the lecture time going over that material, but
instead will use it as an opportunity to go into more detail about issues and topics. For each
module, I will prepare a brief guide that will outline what we will be covering and provide you
with space to fill in the details.
Discussion Groups
You will be randomly assigned to a small discussion group that is a subsection of the whole
class. Each group will have four members in it and will have its own section on Canvas. This is
where you will post your discussion prompts and comments. Your discussions will only be
accessible to members in your group and not the entire class.
Tests and Assignments
There are four tests and three assignments. You get to drop your lowest grade for each. These
tests and assignments are timed, meaning you must complete them within a fixed amount of
time (as if you were sitting in a lecture hall during a class in the regular fall and spring
semesters). You will only have one opportunity to do them (meaning you can’t log out and log
back in again later to complete them). They will only be available for a limited amount of time on
the test or assignment date.
NOTE
** All times are Central Daylight Time (CDT). If you are in another time zone, you are
responsible for adjusting the time so that you are logging in at the correct CDT time. Missing a
meeting or deadline as a result of confusion about time zones does not count as an acceptable
excuse. **
                                                                                                  2


MY EXPECTATIONS OF YOU:
1. Speak up: If you have a question or need something explaining, then let me know. I am
   available via e-mail, Skype and Facebook.
2. Be prepared: Do the readings and work through the modules at a steady pace. Don’t leave
   things until the last minute.
3. Check the course Web site regularly: You must log on to the class web site regularly to
   participate in class.
4. You MUST check your e-mail regularly. Failure to do so is not an acceptable excuse for
   missing an important announcement, assignment or update. If your home-based Internet
   connection is down, then check your e-mail at the library or at a friend’s house.
5. Please let me know immediately if you have any problem that is preventing you from
   performing satisfactorily in this class. If you approach me at the end of the semester, it will
   likely be too late to do anything.
ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING:

        • One AD CRITIQUE. This post is a substantial discussion of a contemporary ad that
             you have found. You will be assigned a date on which to upload your post.
        • Three RESPONSE COMMENTS. For the three weeks that you are not responsible
             for posting the Ad Critique, you are expected to post a thoughtful and meaningful

5. Two Assignments:
   a. Each assignment will be a long-form answer to a prompt that asks you to apply the
        information you’ve learned so far. For example, you may be asked to compare and
        contrast three ads. Or you might be given a scenario and asked how you would respond
        as an advertiser.
   b. There are three assignments but your lowest assignment score will be dropped
   c. The assignment will be timed and you will only have 90 minutes to complete it. You must

  ** Lowest score will be dropped
**Important:
Because your lowest test and assignment scores are dropped, there will be no make-up tests
or opportunities to re-do (or hand in late) the tests or assignments.
There are no excused “absences” or missed assignments/tests. I do not differentiate between
excused and unexcused absences or justified and unjustified reasons for not meeting deadlines.
It’s not my place to decide which excuses are more legitimate or more worthy than others.
Assignment 3 and the Final Exam are essentially optional, since only two assignment scores
and three test scores will be counted toward your final grade. If you are satisfied with the scores
on your first two assignments and first three tests, then you need not take Assignment 3 or the
Final Exam. However, if you miss one of the tests or assignments during the semester, then you
must take the optional assignment or exam. Note that the Final Exam is cumulative and covers
the whole semester. The regular tests are not cumulative.
Some Words on Grading:
•    I will NOT be rounding up percentage grades or points. So if you earn an 89.6% that
     translates into a B+ and will not be rounded up to 90% (an A-). Note that Canvas does round
     up so your grade on Canvas might not be correct. Always add up your total points to
     determine your grade. Never go with the grade Canvas gives you.
•    Note that your grade on Canvas is most likely NOT accurate, for various reasons. First,
     Canvas often rounds up grades; I do not. Second, it counts everything, even assignments
     that will be dropped. To calculate your final grade, simply add up your points earned so far.
                                                                                                   4


•   Any questions or concerns about a grade must be presented in writing (i.e. via email) within
    three (3) days after the grade is announced or posted. I will not discuss grades after that.
•   When we grade your work, you start with zero points. You earn points based on the quality
    of the work and the accuracy, appropriateness and detail of your answers. You do not start
    with 100 points and then lose them based on mistakes you might make. Your final points
    represent the total points earned for that assignment, not the number of points “taken away”
    for errors or omissions.
Extra Credit:
You will have an opportunity to earn extra credit by taking part in two additional online research
studies. I will notify you when the studies are available and will send you the link. Participation in
each study will earn you 0.4 points (about 0.25%) added to your final grade.
Grading System:
This class will be graded using the plus/minus grading system, as outlined by the university’s
provost office (http://www.utexas.edu/provost/planning/plus-minus/) and described below:
                                                     This is the percent         And the GPA

What the letter grades mean:
A, A–        Earned by work of excellent quality indicating full mastery of the subject; in the case
             of an A, it indicates extraordinary distinction.
B+, B, B– Earned by work that indicates commendable comprehension of the course material
             and the student’s full engagement with the course requirements and activities.
C+, C, C– Earned by work that indicates average and satisfactory comprehension of the
             course material and the student has met the basic requirements for completing
             assigned work and participating in class activities.
D+, D, D– Earned by work that is unsatisfactory but that indicates some minimal command of
             the course materials and some minimal participation in class activities that is worthy
             of course credit toward the degree.
F            Earned by work that is unsatisfactory and indicates a failure to do minimal passing
             work
                                                                                                     5


COURSE PROGRESSION:
NOTE: You must move through the modules sequentially. Canvas will lock a module (it will be
invisible to you in Canvas) until the previous modules have been viewed. For example, you will
not be able to access Module 4 until you have gone through all the components from Module 3.
To complete a module, you will have to view all the videos, download all the files and click on
any included links.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:
University of Texas Honor Code: The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are
learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each
member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust,
fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code. Any
work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit must be the student's own work. I
encourage you to collaborate with your fellow students by studying together and discussing
information and concepts covered in lecture, but all tests, quizzes and assignments must be
done independently.
Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student
who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment.
Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and
University disciplinary action.
During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during
the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way.
Any collaborative behavior during the examinations will result in failure of the exam, and may
lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.
OTHER UNIVERSITY NOTICES AND POLICIES:
1. Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence to Students
All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student notification
policy. It is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or
her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in
order to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain
communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a
minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your e-
mail address are available at: http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html.
2. Documented Disability Statement
Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should
contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-
3986 (video phone). Faculty are not required to provide accommodations without an official
accommodation letter from SSD.
     ▪   Please notify me as quickly as possible if the material being presented in class is not
         accessible (e.g., instructional videos need captioning, course packets are not readable
         for proper alternative text conversion, etc.).
     ▪   Contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986
         (video phone) or reference SSD’s website for more disability-related information:
         http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/for_cstudents.php
3. Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
the date of observance of a religious holy day.
                                                                                                   8


4. Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns
Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service
is provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and
Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of
Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
5. Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic
reasons to six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:
        “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not
        permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any
        course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher education, unless
        the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
6. Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble
outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the
following policies regarding evacuation:
        ▪ Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember
            that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the
            building.
        ▪ If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of
            class.
        ▪ In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department,
or the Fire Prevention Services office gives you instructions to do so.
                                                                                                 9


A NOTE ON WORKLOAD
Because this is a summer class, the pace will be considerably faster than during the regular fall
or spring long semesters. To help you figure out how much time you can expect to spend on this
class, consider the following.
For each 1 credit hour, the university estimates workload to include one hour in class and an
additional two to three hours studying outside of class for a total of 3 to 4 hours per week (per
credit hour).
For a single, 3-credit course, workload would look like this:
       3 hours in class + 6-9 hours studying outside class per week = 9-12 hours per week
Over a 15-week semester, the total hours would be:
                 9-12 hours per week X 15 weeks = 135-180 hours per semester
For a five-week class, this translates into:
                     135-180 hours per 15 weeks/5weeks = 27-36 hours/week
                           OR 4-5 hours a day over a seven-day week.
Keep this time commitment in mind as you balance your other obligations, including work,
internships and other summer classes.
                                                                                                  10
