surrounding this site.
  TO ACHIEVE OUR COURSE GOALS, HERE ARE THE RELATED OBJECTIVES...
  • Define & explain key terms & concepts: African diaspora, race, gender, historical archaeology
  • Compare & contrast the experiences of African Americans in the U.S. from slavery to the early 20th century.
  • Relate, using case studies, how archaeological research has contributed to scholarship on African American
    history. What are some of the key questions and interpretations?
  • Demonstrate your knowledge of primary sources, artifacts, & other lines of evidence (e.g. oral histories) used to
    study Black history.
  • Explain how the past is politicized in today’s society and discuss examples of how to implement ethical &
    socially responsible approaches to researching the past.

Tips for doing well in                       I hope you’ll contribute to discussions,
this class…                                  share your insights and opinions, ask lots
                                             of questions, and get to know your
                                             classmates & I. The other option, which
1. Do the reading before class. I’ve kept    me & Bart really don’t like, is for you to

keeping in mind that this is an intro        your mind.
course on archaeology. We’ll have time
during class to discuss the readings so
you’ll become familiar with the concepts,
terms, etc., but the discussions aren’t an
alternative to the readings. You’ll get
more out of these discussions & be better
prepared for the exams if you’ve done
the reading.
2. Check the syllabus regularly for due
dates.
3. Ask questions, even (especially!) while
I’m lecturing.
4. Forty-percent of your final grade will
require that you are in class for the
exercises, etc. Might be easier just to
come twice a week for the semester
rather than worry about which days
there’s an in-class assignment.
5. Email me at least a few days before an
exam if you have questions, not at 1am
the morning of that exam.
