  VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (Core Component 050)
This course may be used to fulfill the visual and performing arts component of the
university core curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by
the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking
skills, teamwork, and social responsibility.
Course description:
Can we adopt the criteria used for the analysis and presentation of western art and artists
for the analysis and presentation of works by Africana women artists? How do we define
Africana women’s art and artists? Who are the most influential Africana women artists,
and in which mediums do they work? What tasks do they tackle and what challenges face


them? What are the stylistic diversities that define and distinguish their contributions?
What are the technological tools available to them, and how have they manipulated and
fashioned these tools? How have they shaped the past and present trends in art history, and
what are their aspirations and hopes for the future? These are some of the questions that
this course will investigate with the use of art historical and critical theories that draw on
oral and written literatures, music, films, and other formal and informal documents.

dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course
and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students,
and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For

Religious Holy Days
It is university policy that you must notify me of a pending absence at least 14 days prior to the

within a reasonable time after the absence.
