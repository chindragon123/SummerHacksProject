I. Rationale:
This course explores the production spectrum of 3-D digital modeling; building creative ideas into a variety of
completed models and assets through a series of iterative projects.
II. Course Aims and Objectives:
Aims
This course teaches students to manifest ideas from thought to tangible form in a digital space. This course
empowers students to create anything that they can possibly think of, through projects focused on the creation of
solidly constructed 3-D characters, objects and vehicles produced in various methods. One will be able to try
various aspects of production during the exploration of the commercial, artistic, and experimental nature of 3 -D
digital modeling. Students will also explore the link between digital and physical modeling via 3D printing of
digital models.
Specific Learning Objectives:
By the end of this course, students will:
         •    Understand the similarities and differences between producing high poly and low poly character
              models in 3-D
         •    Conceptualize both organic and hard surface models
         •    Create character and vehicle /prop designs in the form of digital 3-D models
         •    Display a thorough understanding of topology
         •    Explore 3-D modeling through multiple approaches, such as box modeling, planar modeling as well as
              3-D digital sculpting
         •    Apply clear Aesthetic choices to 3-D digital media
         •    Understand the state of the art of Digital Distribution through social media networks
         •    Explore digital modeling as sculpture through 3d printing of 3
III. Format and Procedures:
This course will meet twice a week. During the first meeting, there will be a lecture that will include demonstration
                                                            1


along with discussion. On the second class meeting of the week, there will be group learning project with
discussion. This may take the form of an in class activity, critique or other collaboration which should include
feedback. Even on days where a project is not due, students should be prepared with ready to show project progress.
The in-class projects will review and practice the material covered from the week’s first class meeting. Active
                                                            2


participation in weekly in-class group projects and discussions will be a major component of the professionalism
and participation component of student grades for the course that will comprise 20% of the final grade.
IV. Tentative Course Schedule: **This syllabus represents my current plans and objectives. As we go
through the semester, those plans may need to change to enhance the class learning opportunity. Such changes,

Feedback Statement (to encourage students to respond to your requests for their feedback)
During this course I will be asking you to give me feedback on your learning in informal as well as formal ways,
including through anonymous surveys about how my teaching strategies are helping or hindering your learning. It’s
very important for me to know your reaction to what we’re doing in class, so I encourage you to respond to these
surveys, ensuring that together we can create an environment effective for teaching and learning.
V. My Assumptions
It is my belief that with hard work and a little bit of patience, anyone can be good at 3 -D digital art. The learning
curve is slower for some than others, but do not be discouraged and you will get to where you want to be. With the
projects we do in this course, I advise students to make something that they can get really excited about. Think
about making short-term goals for your progress, and try to learn a new skill each day. The 3 -D digital art process is
very iterative, in that projects build upon one another, and many steps are repeated ad infinitum. With a firm plan in
place, it will be easy to create a road map for success.
VI. Course Requirements:
          1. Class attendance and participation policy:
                    (a) Expected classroom behavior: take notes, ask many questions, and attend class for the entire
                         duration. Make a solid effort on each project outside of class, so that you may have many
                         questions to contribute to the discussion.
                    (b) Cell phone use, including texting, is unallowable. Keep cell phones stored during the duration
                         of class
                    Religious Holy Days
                    By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
                    the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
                    assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to
                    complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
          2. Course Readings/Materials:
                    (a) Recommended Textbooks: Introducing Autodesk Maya 2016: Autodesk Official Press, by
                    Dariush Derakhshani. 1st Edition. ISBN: 9781119059639
                    (b) Supplies needed: Laptop computer capable of running Autodesk Maya and Unity.
                    (c) Other supplies: Jump Drive for external storage and data backup. A mouse for your laptop, as
                    the 3D software will be much slower to use without one.

Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six (6). As
stated in Senate Bill 1231:
          “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit an
   undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has
   dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than
   that number.”
Emergency Evacuation Policy
 Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm
 is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
          ▪▪ Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest
               exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
          ▪▪ If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
          ▪▪ In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police
