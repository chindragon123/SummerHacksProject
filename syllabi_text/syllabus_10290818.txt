Central Europe Goes to Hollywood
          Hollywood’s golden age, from the 1930s through the 1960s, was due in no small part to
the presence of emigrants or refugees: actors, directors, writers, studio heads, and technical
production people. The films in this class come from one of Europe’s most dynamic culture
industry: the filmmakers in Central Europe (= Austria, Germany, and Slavic countries) and what
they brought with them that created Hollywood as we know it.
          This course will introduce you to some of their finest films, to the relationship between
films and how/when they are made, and to the problems faced by artists in exile then and now (as
they try to recoup careers and reputations, and deal with media, publicity, stereotyping, and
language barriers). While these examples span films from b/w times on, they represent how the
commercial film industries worked before the era of streaming and niche audiences.
          The class will offer case studies in various problems associated with understanding films
in their own right and as part of a culture industry. Case studies here will favor especially “Austria
in Hollywood” as representing a cluster of problems surrounding filmmakers’ styles, audience
expectations, censorship, and commercial film genres (and how they came from the stage. The
talent from Central Europe on Broadway and in Hollywood was an unparalleled source of within
the culture industries, this exemplary immigrant community offered an unparalleled source of film
industry talent and critical intelligence, contributing an urbane, witty tone to the Hollywood film,
joining entertainment to sophisticated social criticism.
          These films will also be used to introduce how to “read” plays, films, and media and how
to think critically about their content -- especially what it means to cross cultural lines, to import
and export culture across political and social boundaries. Topics to be addressed include:
          -adaptations (book to play to film to remakes)
          -conventions and stereotyping
          -censorship
          -film genres and intertextuality
          -directors, esp. Ernst Lubitsch & Billy Wilder
          -famous faces: how celebrity works

      WATCH IN CLASS: Scene from Eyes Wide Shut: the argument (equivalent of text)
               (full film on Amazon for $2.99)
      CLASS DISCUSSION:
                "Translation" or adaptation (especially with remakes) requires awareness of a source and
               a target -- two frames of reference, each including a culture's sense of stereotype, genre,
               etc., and an audience with a specific set of viewing habits. The challenge for an adaptor is
               to make the source material fit the target. What kinds of issues must be dealt with in
               moving materials across national, audience, language, or time boundaries? What changes
               needed to be made to make EWS work for a US audience?

               and what figure out from reviews and star ratings if these films work in US and one other country
      HOMEWORK DUE (may be turned in by a group collectively): ~250-300 words: take either EWS or
               Some Like It Hot (using trailer and Wikipedia plot summary) and explain how it would have been
               rated in its day -- what could a censor have objected to?

      START Midterm Project:
      Choose one of the films we have seen clips of so far this semester and discuss it from three of the
      following perspectives:
           1. How its final form and distribution represents/ caters to something in the "star system"
           2. How it represents a "translation" of materials from one place to another (adapting content to
               viewership or casting, transformation of medium, etc.)
           3. How it caters to an audience and what audience you think it's catering to
           4. How it represents a particular style ("noir," "the studio musical," a genre)
           5. How it might be problematic for a production code system
      YOU TURN IN: 3-5 double-spaced pages written like an essay exam; be sure each topic is addressed
               with CONCRETE INFORMATION about film, reception, star, director, etc., AND with AT LEAST
               ONE, and preferably TWO references to specific scenes/production details that make your point.
               USE proper bibliographic citation styles for the film and any texts you quote from; - see
               https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/citesources (Chicago Style or MLA most common choices).

            settings.
      READ: two versions of one play
           • Thornton Wilder, Merchant of Yonkers
           • ---, Matchmaker (plays)
      SKIM (optional)
           • Oxenford, A Day Well Spent
      IN-CLASS DISCUSSION: How do the two versions of the Wilder play differ? Find at least two BIG
            differences and decide what the "elevator pitch" for each would be.
      NOTE: this discussion will be the basis for homework to be turned in next week.
TH    Importing Genres: Hidden Histories, 2: Two Different Adaptations

           • Hirschorn, "In the Picture"
           • Kelly, "Directing Dolly"
      IN CLASS DISCUSSION: we continue to compare versions of Wilder's materials -- some of the weird
                parts of Dolly may be holdovers! Be sure you've read through the plot summaries; Matchmaker
                (with Shirley Boothe) online at Amazon prime for2.99; Dolly for 3.99. You may need to pick one
                for next week's homework, not for today.

TU    Importing Genres: Genre Bending, 1


        BRIEF LECTURE: The film-native musical as a studio product importing other media but creating a
                new cinematography

            • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kelly
            • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busby_Berkeley
        IN CLASS: In these films, many were Jukebox musicals that exploited music catalogues to which the
                studio had rights. This is a problem of restaging that is different from the case of Dolly, whose
                score was composed for a musical. The auteur is now the choreographer and/or the studio
                cinematographers and cameramen. Discussion of scenes that are LEGENDARY!!!!!
            • Kelly's Dolly! vs. Busby Berkeley's 42nd Street and Ziegfeld Girl (1941)
                     o *Note: the former is pre-code and the latter is not.
        HOMEWORK DUE: Thornton Wilder PowerPoint Elevator Pitch. You want to remake one of the play
                and/or film versions as a movie. Pitch: 1) why that version; 2) why now; 3) for what audience
                (that might include casting). You have exactly 4 ppt slides (+ a title slide, with your name and
                bibliography for version on it) to make your case. Upload to CANVAS SITE where indicated.

         BRIEF CLASS LECTURE: Nativism and nationalism in theater/film history. The "American musical" can
                be linked directly back to Central European theater practice. Up until World War II, Broadway
                talent, including the Yiddish Theater, often were immigrants, children of immigrant, or
                professionals who had studied in Europe; the plays and musical entertainments were often direct
                borrowings, as well (see: Carousel and Dolly, as we have seen); film "talent" was Broadway and
                radio and vaudeville and nightclub talent, often without restaging (prominent early examples:
                Marx Brothers; W. C. Fields and Mae West).
         CLASS DISCUSSION: these two films recreate Broadway -- an operetta and a variety. What are the
                staging conventions?
         HOMEWORK DUE: proposal for your final project -- an abstract stating what film, why it's worth working
                on, how you're going to work on it, and why you chose that approach.


TH    Importing Genres, 2: Genre Bending, from Stage to Screen, and the Hangovers -- two different
      staging tribes?
      BRIEF INTRODUCTION: film vs. theater "cultures" -- the dangers of assuming "equivalencies" or
              "originality" when the media aren't independent; when the director knows "too much" and the
              studio (and its properties" are in control.
      DISCUSSION OF CASE STUDY CLIPS: what are the performance conventions? How "cinematic" are
              they?
          1. Vaudeville to the studio musical: For Me and My Gal (dir. Berkeley, but for the Arthur Freed studio
              unit at MGM) -- on Amazon Video
          2. Operetta to the studio musical: Gene Kelly, The Pirate
              (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ECX2X0)
          3. Ziegfeld Girl (1941), musical numbers by Busby Berkeley
          4. Hello, Dolly! -- store scenes from stage farce conventions, which often use one set with lots of
              doors and physical humor close calls (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farce)

      SHORT LECTURE: These are two of the benchmarks for pre-war operetta films, with the conventions in
              place because actors were experienced in both media -- Lubitsch set an early bar for character-
              driven operettas with Lehar's material; "Great Waltz" is the bio-pic of the "waltz king" Johann
              Strauss, Jr., done in operetta style.
