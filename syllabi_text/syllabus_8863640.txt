Description:
This course offers a broad introduction to the culture, history, and society of Japan from ancient times to
present. We will do this by tracing the evolution of key figures and people over time: the Emperor from the
dawn of time to today; court ladies in the Heian period; samurai, merchants, & their wives in the middle ages
to Edo. Along the way, we’ll consider also neighboring Chinese & Koreans, Western barbarians & postwar
occupiers, war dead, soldiers & Self Defense Forces, as well as poets, propagandists & protestors. In the
final weeks of the semester, students will break off into smaller reading groups centered around Norma
Field’s 1991 book In the Realm of the Dying Emperor to facilitate in-depth discussions on important
contemporary debates revolving around many of these key figures and issues.
The primary goal of this course is to discover how citizens, intellectuals, leaders, policymakers, and artists
were negotiating the particular contexts in which they lived by analyzing primary source materials (i.e. laws,
memoirs, letters, poems, essays, stories, art, etc.) produced in the period. The secondary goal of this course
is to learn how to read these sources critically and analytically. The format of the course will include both
lecture as well as small group and class discussion. Your active participation is essential. This course
provides an introductory foundation for students to go onto more specialized, upper-division courses in fields
such as Japanese anthropology, art history, economics, film, history, international business, literature,
political science, religion, and sociology. This course carries the Global Cultures flag, which means it is
designed to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States.
Required Materials:
     1) Course Reader, avail. for purchase at Jenn’s Copy Shop NORTH branch (2518 Guadalupe St, 482-0779).
     2) Norma Field, In the Realm of the Dying Emperor (IRDE), available at Co-Op for purchase or feel
          free to buy online (ISBN # 9780679741893).
     3) A packet of standard size 3”X5” index cards to use for frequent in-class pop quizzes or exercises.
     4) Discussion questions. For the vast majority of our readings (or sets of related readings), I will
          regularly post discussion questions (DQ) on Canvas under Files. These will help focus your reading
          and your notetaking as well as help to prepare you for in-class discussion and tests.
Your class will frequently use the Lectures Online recording system. This system records the audio and
video material presented in class for you to review after class. Links for the recordings will appear in the
Lectures Online tab (on left side) in Canvas.
Grading Policy
Grades are assigned as follows: 93-100 = A; 90-92.9 = A-; 87-89.9 = B+; 83-86.9 = B; 80-82.9 = B-; 77-79.9
= C+; 73-76.9 = C; 70-72.9 = C-; 67-69.9 = D+; 63-66.9 = D; 60-62.9 = D-; below 60 = F. As a rule, I do not
grade on a curve or round up grades. If you receive an 89, you will receive a B+. One exception to this rule
is that a grade that is very close to the next grade level, such as an 89.9 or 79.9, may be rounded up to the
higher grade if the student has consistently attended class and participated fully.
                                                                                                               1


Grading:
Pop Quizzes and In-class Individual & Group Work: 25% TOTAL (2 lowest grades automatically dropped)
    Frequent pop quizzes will be given at the start or during class. Their purpose is twofold: to track
    attendance and to check if you have done the reading assignments and/or are understanding the
    materials. You will be eligible for partial credit if you attend class but get the answers wrong. You need to
    use an index card for these or they will not be graded. Your two lowest quiz scores will be automatically
    dropped. No make-ups allowed.
Tests: 2 total = 55% TOTAL (no makeups)
    Exam 1 (weeks 1-6) = 25%
    Exam 2 (weeks 7-12) = 30%
    Each test will cover all materials – readings, lectures, discussions – from that Unit. Details about the
    format of the exams will be given at least one week prior.
Individual In-Class Work during Weeks 12, 14, and 15 = 5% TOTAL
    During the final weeks of the semester, we will be reading Norma Field’s 1991 book, In the Realm of the
    Dying Emperor. This book will enable us to review many of the key concepts and figures we have studied
    over the course of the semester as well as to update our analysis by considering how these issues
    continue to matter to contemporary debates. As noted on the schedule, for these sessions, you will be
    split into two separate groups to facilitate smaller group discussions. Show up only on the day assigned
    for your group prepared to actively engage/talk. Group assignments TBA.
Take-home final project/essay = 15% TOTAL (due Monday, Dec. 10 at 10 a.m.)
    This will be a cumulative final project/essay (maximum 5-pages) that focuses largely on your response
    to Field’s book while asking that you integrate what you have learned over the course of the semester
    into your response. The prompt for this project/essay will be announced by early November.
Extra Credit Opportunity = 0–3% added to Exam (2 maximum total, 1 allowed per exam):
Media Watch Assignment: Pick a recent (ideally within the past 3 months, no more than 1 year old) news
    article from any reliable news source (online or print media okay, avoid Wikipedia or random chat
    forums), and submit a hard copy of the original news article with complete citation information along with
    a 2-page (maximum) engaging personal response. Your grade is based on quality of submission & depth
    of engagement. Choose your topic and timing wisely so that it is something that enriches our study of
    Japan. You may opt to do a maximum of two of these assignments, one for each unit test, for up to 3%
    extra credit points toward that unit test. At the latest, the first is due by Mon. Oct 8th (class time on the
    day of Exam #1 day) and the second by Mon. Nov 19th (Exam #2 day). No lates accepted.
Instructions for 2-page (maximum) engaging personal essay:
    No need for a formal paper here, but be sure to do five things in your 2-page (typed, double spaced, 1”
    margins, in Times or equivalent font):
       1) Give it a catchy and appropriate title that establishes your main point.
       2) Very briefly (2-3 sentences) describe the article or speaker’s main point/argument.
       3) Pick 1-2 of the most interesting and thought-provoking things about the article to
           discuss and probe in depth. This should be something that provoked a strong reaction in you,
           whether positive or negative because it was intriguing, illuminating, controversial, objectionable, etc.
       4) Explain briefly how the article relates in some way to something specific we have
           discussed in class and/or why this topic is important to your understanding of Japan.
       5) Finally, be ready to discuss your ideas in the next class if called upon to do so.
                                                                                                                  2
