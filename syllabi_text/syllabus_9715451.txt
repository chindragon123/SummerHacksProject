Course Description:
         This is an introductory, inter-disciplinary course on the peoples and cultures of
Africa, designed for students with a limited background in African studies as well as
those who want to improve their understanding of this huge continent. The course is
divided into two parts, one on a survey history and the other on aspects of culture. The
subjects cover the long historical era known as the precolonial, which terminated at the
turn of the twentieth century when Africa came under European rule. Among the main
themes are: early history, kingdoms, interactions with external agencies, and various
institutions and customs of society. Readings are drawn from two textbooks, two
monographs. The books deal with essential outline histories and dense interpretive
literature on a few issues. Films provide visual illustrations and additional perspectives.
Goals:
     1) To use a combination of films, lectures and reading materials to introduce
         students to a number of themes in African history and cultures.
     2) To enable students to reflect on a number of issues in order to reach independent
         conclusions.
     3) To provide an adequate background that will prepare students for other courses on
         Africa.
     4) To improve the writing and analytical skills of students, by introducing them to
         the craft of history writing.
