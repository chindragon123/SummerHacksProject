COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course surveys the history and impact of music in the United States from colonial
times to the present, with an emphasis on music of the 20th century. The course
progresses more or less chronologically, organized around topics and themes. We will
delve into music’s role in the cultural, social, and political landscape of American history
from a range of genres, styles, and perspectives, including classical, popular, and folk
traditions. Topics covered include nationalism, race and ethnicity, the role of technology
in shaping and disseminating music, cultural register, and musical communities.
Musical background is not required for this course. We will mostly use recordings rather
than scores (although we will discuss the changing nature of the musical score over the
course of the semester). Regardless of musical skill level, you will be expected to listen
closely to the works assigned for each class and to be prepared to discuss and write about
the music in detail. During the semester, we will review any musical terms you will need
for assignments. Together, we will listen to, analyze, and discuss music and its creation,
reception and impact on American culture and history.
Research and writing are crucial components of the course. Prose is your vehicle for
creative and intellectual expression. Focus intently on your writing; the investment will
yield results. We will explore how strengthening research and writing skills can not only
enrich our understanding of American music, but also can affect our engagement with
music and culture outside the classroom.
COURSE OBJECTIVES:
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
    §   understand the cultural context of a range of musical styles and movements over
        the course of America’s history
                                                                                             1


     §  recognize and describe general elements of these musical styles and identify
        influential musical works
     §  gain greater knowledge of American political, cultural, and social history through
        the country’s musical history
     §  gain deeper understanding of how music both reflects and shapes various
        identities in American culture—including gender, race, ethnicity, and class—and
        how these categories have shifted over time
     §  become more aware of the contexts of our own music-making and listening in
        contemporary America
     §  strengthen research and writing skills, and understand how in-depth historical
        research can enrich our experience as musicians and/or audience members
WRITING FLAG:
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write
regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback
from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity
to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’
work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your
written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical
Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the
Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
CULTURAL DIVERSITY IN THE UNITED STATES:
This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity
courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the
American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your
grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least
one U.S. cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalization.
COURSE MATERIALS:

Attendance and Participation:
You are expected to attend all classes, complete all reading and listening assigned before
each class, and participate in class discussion. You will be allowed THREE unexcused
absences, and after that, your attendance grade will be affected.
We will work in class on many of the details pertaining to the written assignments;
therefore, it is crucial to your success in the course that you make attendance a priority.
Listening Quizzes:
Instead of a midterm or final exam, there will be 6 short quizzes over the course of the
semester. The quizzes are intended to keep you up to date on your reading and listening.
You will be asked to identify the composer/performer, the work, and the date (within 3
years), as well as to complete short answer prompts about key concepts from the assigned
listening and reading. Quizzes will only cover material covered in class since the previous
quiz. There are no make-up quizzes, but I will drop your lowest quiz grade.
                                                                                            3


Response Papers:
There will be a series of brief (~1 page single-spaced) response papers due over the course
of the semester. The response papers are intended to help you dig deeper into the course
material, and will give you a chance to practice your writing regularly throughout the
semester. Response papers must be printed out and handed in at the beginning of class on
the day they are due. Unless you have an excused absence, no late assignments will
be accepted. (Any response papers missed for an excused absence may be given an
extension of up to one week, at my discretion, if I am notified in advance of the absence.)
Written Assignments:
Paper 1: Review/Song Analysis Paper (750-1000 words): due Friday 3/1
Attend a concert featuring American music and write an analytical review, exploring the
historical and cultural context of the music performed and analyzing its style. You must
consult at least 2 sources to enhance your analysis. OR Choose a song or work on the
syllabus up to this point and analyze the work in depth, exploring its historical and
cultural context and its musical style. You must consult at least 3 additional sources not
assigned in class. You will complete the paper in stages, bringing in a paragraph and a full
draft in advance of the deadline, and will be expected to revise one paragraph based on
feedback after the paper is completed. More details will be provided closer to the
deadline.
Paper 2a and 2b: Trans-Historical Analysis: Paper 2a due Friday 4/12; Paper 2b due
Sunday 5/12
Paper 2a (1500 words): Choose two class days from our syllabus that could be part of a
trans-historical topic or theme (i.e. music and technology, music and race/ethnicity,
music and politics). (You may include one class day that we have not yet covered, but you
must complete the reading/listening in advance). Select one additional topic (a genre,
historical period, composer, etc.) that’s not included on the syllabus but that connects to
the theme you’ve chosen and that you think could be included on the syllabus. Make a
case for their points of connection. How do we understand these topics differently
studying them in conjunction, rather than in isolation? Does grouping them under a
single theme make us understand each topic in a different way? What biases do we risk by
grouping them together?
Paper 2b (2000 words): Based on the material gathered for your first paper, rework the
material from the first version of your paper into a think-piece that might be read by a
general audience (think New Yorker or Rolling Stone), conveying the contemporary relevance
of your trans-historical topic. This is a chance to be creative, and to experiment with a
different writing style and tone. You will be asked to include a writing reflection with the
final version of your paper. More details will be provided closer to the deadline.
Live Production:
On Friday, February 8, at 8:00pm, we will attend Songs of Freedom at Texas Performing
Arts. TPA has $10. Payment must be received by me (cash only) by Monday, 1/28. If
you cannot attend on 2/8, you must notify me by 1/28, and you are expected to attend
the production on Sat. 2/9 instead (you are responsible for purchasing your own ticket).
                                                                                             4


COURSE POLICIES:
Absences and Late Work
     § Absences: Excused absences are any absence for which you have a valid, verifiable
        excuse: a significant medical situation (with a doctor’s note) or a university-
        sponsored performance (with appropriate documentation). Undocumented
        illnesses may not be counted as excused absences. You are responsible for
        contacting me in advance about any absences and for providing the appropriate
        documentation.
             o You will be allowed THREE unexcused absences, and after that, your
                 attendance grade will be affected.
             o You are also responsible for any content that you miss due to absence,
                 including assignments or in-class activities.
     § Lateness: Arrive to class on time. If you are late to class three times it will count as
        one absence. (Please inform me in advance if there is a reason you expect to be
        late frequently, i.e. if you have a class right before this one on the other side of
        campus.)
     § Late work: Late papers lose one grade point per day (A to A-, etc.), and receive a
        zero after one week past the deadline. No late response papers are accepted.
     § Quizzes: There will be no make-up quizzes, but I will drop your lowest quiz
        grade.
Laptops and Technology
     § Laptops/tablets are permitted for note taking and referring to the readings. If you
        choose to use a laptop, please sit toward the front of the class. I reserve the right to
        prohibit the use of laptops if they are being used for other purposes during class. If
        I catch unauthorized laptop use during class, you will receive an
        absence for that class meeting. Studies show that you learn better if you take
        notes in a notebook rather than on a computer, so consider leaving the laptop at
        home or in your bag.
     § No phones to be used during class (including texting, facebooking, and tweeting!).
        Turn off your ringers before entering the classroom. You will get one
        warning, after which you will receive an absence for that class
        meeting.
Email and Communication Policy
Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are
responsible for reading your email for university and course-related information and
announcements. You are responsible for keeping the university informed about changes
to your e-mail address. You should check your e-mail regularly and frequently – I
recommend daily, but at minimum twice a week – to stay current with university-related
communications, some of which may be time-critical. Email is the primary mode of
communication for this course. It is your responsibility to make sure that your email
settings are such that you can receive official email from the university, and more
specifically, through Canvas. I will do my best to respond to your emails in a timely
manner. Please allow a 24-hour turnaround time for course-related emails, possibly
longer on weekends/holidays.
                                                                                               5


Honor Code
Students are expected to uphold the University of Texas Honor Code:
         The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery,
         freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of
         the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust,
         fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Plagiarism
According to the University of Texas Student Judicial Services, plagiarism occurs if you
represent as your own work any material that was obtained from another source,
regardless how or where you acquired it. For more information on plagiarism, see:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis_plagiarism.php
Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student’s
own work. Guidance on how to properly cite the sources you use in your essay will be
given in class, so that you will be equipped to avoid unintentional plagiarism. ALL
suspected cases of cheating and plagiarism may be reported to Student Judicial Services.
Students with Disabilities
If you require special accommodations, you must obtain a letter that documents your
disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity
and Community Engagement (471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf
or hard of hearing). Present the letter to me at the beginning of the semester so we can
discuss the accommodations you need. No later than five business days before an exam,
you should remind me of any testing accommodations you will need. For more
information, visit http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.
Religious Holidays
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days
prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an
examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you
will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after
the absence.
                                                                                              6
