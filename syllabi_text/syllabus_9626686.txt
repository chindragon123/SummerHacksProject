I. Course Overview
This course explores issues that impact human development. They are controversial in that they reflect problems with
no obvious solutions. Rather than memorizing a set of facts delivered via my lectures, students will become familiar
with the topics through their own class presentations. In the course of this analysis students should also become
more familiar with the many ways that developmental psychologists go about answering basic questions such as: “Is
nature or nurture more important for developmental outcome?”
II. Course Requirements
A. The Psychology Department will drop all students who do not meet the following prerequisites:
     (1) PSY 301 & PSY 418 (or equivalent listed in course schedule) completed with a grade of C or better
     (2) Upper-division standing (60 hours completed)
B. Readings: Posted in PDF format on Canvas: http://canvas.utexas.edu/
THIS IS A DISCUSSION-BASED COURSE. YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT:
         You will find yourself in small and large group discussions that revolve around facts associated with
          our target topics.
         If you do not feel comfortable talking to classmates, or you feel that you will not gain anything from
          a course that is not a traditional lecture-style course, you should probably drop this one.
         This is NOT the kind of course that you can register for and then only show up for exams. Attending
          class regularly and keeping up with weekly readings are crucial for success.
C. Evaluation of Student Performance
          Class participation I: Group Discussion Forum (on Canvas) To encourage you to interact w/your
          classmates about course material, we’ll post some discussion topics on weekly Discussion Forums
          accessible via Canvas through each topic’s module or through Assignments.
                   A new forum will be activated each Monday and closed the following Friday by midnight.
                   For the 4 weeks that the board is up and running, you are required to:
                         o offer comments/responses to posted questions.
                         o respond to at least one of your classmate’s posts.
                   Each correctly posted comment earns you 1 point. Of course, you are encouraged to read this
                    discussion forum regularly and to make comments whenever you like.
                    In addition to offering a chance to make observations, this discussion forum also ‘prods’ you to
                    keep up w/course topics. This component contributes a maximum of 4 points to your total grade.
        Class participation lI: Article Comments This type of class succeeds or fails as a result of your out-of-class
        preparation. You will be expected to read our topic materials in sufficient depth to be able to participate in class
        discussion. To motivate you to do so, you will reflect on the readings sufficiently to come up with a comment
        or a question.
                Ideally, you would read and comment on all of the posted readings in advance of the presentations.
                Realistically, we’ll be looking for comments and questions on at least 1 reading per topic.
                You will post an entry (a comment or a question about the readings for the week’s topics) no later
                 than Monday (by midnight) for the first topic and Wednesday (also by midnight) for the second
                 topic.
                       o As with the Group Discussion Forums, you can access the Article Comments links either
                           through the “Assignments” or the “Modules” areas. Each topic will have its own Article
                           Comment link.
                       o    Each of these comments or questions will be worth 1 point. So—these questions contribute
                           7 points (1 point for our ‘sample’ topic, Trigger Warnings & Microaggressions, plus 6 points
                           for the 6 presented topics) toward your course grade.
                                                               1


              o    The persons presenting on an issue will also be expected to post on the readings
                   related to their topics.
              o    This activity offers an opportunity for me to have a 1-to-1 dialog with each of you. I will
                   respond to at least one of your comments each week.
Ground Rules for Article Comments:
          Please indicate which paper your question or comment addresses (page numbers for specific
           questions/comments are encouraged).
          Since one of the purposes of the questions/comments is to encourage you to keep up with the
           reading, the questions/comments must clearly be related to the reading (Example of a poor
           question related to sex education: “So why are teenagers so stupid about sex anyway?” You could
           have come up with this question without doing any reading.)
          Personal reflections are fine as long as it’s clear that the reflections were stimulated by the reading.
           (“When I read about the type of information teens receive in abstinence classes, I recalled how my
           own sex ed classes….”)
          Clarification questions (“What is chlamydia?”) are OK, but plan on elaborating on your confusion
           (“what is chlamydia? I thought the authors were making a point about HIV, but then they introduced
           chlamydia….”). Remember that questions/comments that you would really like to talk about are
           preferred; many points of clarification can be cleared up on your own through a bit of internet
           research.
Class participation Ill: Student Presentations Finally, to encourage as diverse a set of perspectives as
possible, we will ask you to join a group in presenting facets of our course topics during the semester. You
will be given a separate handout with guidelines for how to do this. Please do not fear this activity.
          What we want from you is very straight forward—a presentation of important concepts, some
           analysis of the topic, and some initiative in encouraging your classmates to join in during your class
           presentation.
                o The presentation is worth 12 points.
          You will also turn in a 4-5 page summary of your contribution to the presentation. Paper grading
           criteria will be discussed in a separate document.
                o The paper is worth 12 points.
           A final component of this group collaboration is the creation of a Wiki for your group’s topic.
                o Links to blank Wiki pages have been created within Modules (on Canvas) for each topic.
                o The purpose of the Wiki is to provide your classmates with an interesting electronic source
                     for the information that you present in class.
                               The Wiki is worth 6 points.
          The presentation-related components total 30 points.
Attendance: Attendance will be taken Tuesday through Friday. This is to encourage you to be in class to
support your classmates as they present their information. You have 2 “free” absences across these 5
weeks. Thereafter, you will begin to lose 1 point per absence from your total course points unless you have
followed the procedures for excused absences described below.
Issue Reports: You will complete Issue Reports for 6 topics—the sample topic (trigger warnings and
microaggressions) plus the 5 issues that you are not presenting.
          By midnight each Monday, Issue Reports from the previous week’s topics that you did not
           present will be due.
          These reports simply summarize the issues associated with our topics.
     Each issue report is worth a possible 4 points making this component of your grade total 24 points. The
      report forms can be downloaded from the “Assignments” or “Modules” areas of Canvas . You will use
      the “File Upload” option. Directions can be found at: https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-3128
Quizzes: On Mondays you will take a quiz made up of multiple choice questions over readings and student
presentations.
          Quiz length will vary with the number of topics presented in the previous week: 10 questions per
           topic.
                                                      2


                    There will be 4 of these in-class quizzes (1 quiz comprising 10 questions, 3 quizzes each
                     comprising 20 questions)
                    The quizzes contribute 70 points toward your grade.
          End-of-Class “Controversy Fair”: For this last assignment, you will have the opportunity to create a
          presentation using 1 of 4 formats that differ from the more conventional one that you will have used
          throughout the course. Exhibits may be group or individual products. The idea here is to address an issue in
          as creative a way as you can devise. This assignment will be described in more detail in a separate
          document. This assignment contributes up to 5 points to your final grade.
          Extra Credit Discussion Boards : In addition to the discussions described above, 4 extra discussion
          forums will be posted as opportunities for extra credit. It’s your responsibility to check Canvas for these
          extra boards. For credit, you’; need to post your own response and one to a peer. These boards contribute
          up to 4 points to your final grade.
Total course points equal 140.          Points will be recorded in your grades on Canvas.
Course grades will be assigned on the basis of the percentage of the total possible points that you earn.
Course Grade                   Per Cent of Course Points
