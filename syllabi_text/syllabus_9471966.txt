                     MEXICAN IMMIGRATION CULTURAL HISTORY
This course seeks to develop a student's understanding of the history of Mexican
immigration to the U.S. It will provide an overview of migratory patterns dating
back to the late pre-historic period through contemporary times. The focus of the
course, however, will be current immigration issues dealing with: 1) causes of
Mexican immigration: globalization, Mexican politics, agribusiness, 2) U.S. Law,
3) incorporation, and 4) citizenship.

Cultural Diversity in the U.S. Flagged Course
        This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States.
Cultural Diversity courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the
variety and richness of the American cultural experience. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one U.S. cultural group that has
experienced persistent marginalization.
Special Accommodations for Tests and Note Assistance Policy
        If special accommodations for tests have been approved by the university,
or if you need assistance for note taking, you must meet with professor during
office hours, and bring your university accommodation letter.
