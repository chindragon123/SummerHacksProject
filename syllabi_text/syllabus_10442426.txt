Textbook: Advertising and Integrated Brand Promotion, 8h Edition, O’Guinn, Thomas C., Chris
T. Allen, Angeline Close Scheinbaum, Richard J. Semenik, including MindTap. (Cengage
Publishing, 2019)
Accessing the online lectures: Lecture content will be available Monday through Friday in the
Modules tab of Canvas.
Course Description:
         This course is designed as a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of
advertising and integrated brand promotion. The role of these persuasive communication tools within the
total marketing effort is studied. Advertising and IBP are presented and examined as (1) an element in our
social system; (2) a business process; (3) an art and communication form; and, (4) a science. The material
presented in class will supplement our textbook.
         ADV 318J will be an asynchronous online course delivered through Canvas meaning that you
have some flexibility within each week as to when you do your readings and view the content. This course
is entirely web-based and consists of daily topic modules that contain a combination of online mini-
lectures, content (podcasts, videos, etc.), assignments, and quizzes/tests. The online materials will be
available at 10:00am weekdays through a streaming media server which requires reliable access to the
internet. You must also have access to a computer that can play videos. Inability to be online is never an
acceptable excuse for missing an important announcement, assignment, exam or update. If your regular
internet connection is not working, then visit a library/coffee shop.
Student Responsibilities:
         • Pay close attention to announcements in Canvas. Announcements are sent through Canvas to
         communicate course information, updates, assignments, etc.
         •Check your email / Canvas messenger daily.
         •Exams test conceptual understanding of lectures and the text. To do well on the exams --
         study your lecture notes and assigned readings. You are responsible for all material
         assigned for each exam.
         •You should develop an awareness of the trends and issues concerning advertising and
         public relations through the weekly reading of Advertising Age, PR Week and AdWeek.
         You should also become especially aware of current advertising/pr methods and practices
         by observing and critically evaluating ads and promotions you see and hear every day.
         •Speak up. If you have a question or need something explained, then let me know. I am
         available via Zoom and email.


Rules used for grading:
         •Assignments must be in on time. If work is late, a grade of "0" will be assessed. All
         assignments must be submitted via Canvas in PDF format.
         •No make-up exams or assignments.
         •Any questions about a grade must be discussed within three days after the grade is
         posted.
Method of Evaluation
         Overall letter grades are based on point totals calculated by adding: (1) four exams (200 points
each), (2) two individual projects (150 points total) and MindTap participation (50 points total). Course
grades are based on each student’s total out of the 1,000 points available. The points necessary to earn a
letter grade are as follows:
                             A=910, A-=870-909.9, B+=850-869.9, B=795-849.9
     C+=766.7-794.9, C=733.4-766.6, C-=695-733.3, D+=666.7-694.9, D=633.4-666.6, D-=595-633.3,
                                                   F=<595.
          At each student’s option, s/he may elect to take the comprehensive final exam (worth 200
points). If the final exam score is higher than the lowest exam score, it will be substituted in place of the
exam score. There are no extra credit assignments, redoing projects or exams -- the only way to earn a
grade is by doing well on the exams and projects. You should check Canvas to confirm your grades on
exams and projects are recorded correctly. Report any errors immediately.
 NOTE: Students must earn at least a B in this class to apply or continue as an advertising/PR major.
Online Exam Policy
         There will be four exams during the semester and an optional final scheduled during the University
final exam period. Exams consist of 40 multiple choice and true/false questions and are given in Canvas.
The exams will be available on exam day for an eight-hour time block. You will have 50 minutes to
complete the exam once you start. If you miss an exam during the semester for any reason, you should plan
to take the comprehensive final exam. There are no make-up exams.
Individual Projects
         Grades on the two individual projects have a significant impact on your final course grade.
Note that although you are encouraged to discuss projects with others in class, you may only turn in your
own, original work.
         If you have a question about your grade on a project, you must contact your me immediately.
Project grades will be discussed three days immediately following their grade posting. After that, grade
changes will not be discussed -- no exceptions.
         Finally, following instructions is an important part of responding to these projects and no late
assignments will be accepted for any reason -- projects are due at 10:00 AM on the date as noted on the
syllabus but may be submitted early. The ability to meet deadlines and attend to details is an important part
of the advertising and public relations business.
MindTap Quiz participation.
          Grades on the MindTap portion of the class are worth a total of 50 points. MindTap is a digital
learning tool offered by the book publisher Cengage and is a part of your textbook purchase. Your grade
will consist of eighteen, chapter quizzes available through Canvas. Each quiz will count 2.5 points and is
due before the four 40 question exams held on Canvas. You get two attempts at each quiz to earn your best


score and they may be completed any time before the due dates on Canvas. Your scores are automatically
calculated by Canvas and entered in the gradebook following your completion of the quizzes. These are a
learning tool that you can use to help assess your knowledge of the textbook material prior to the four
exams. Access the exams by MODULES>ADV318J>Load ADV318J in a new window> Chapter>Chapter
Quiz. If you complete all of the quizzes, you will be awarded 5 extra credit points at the end of the
semester!

Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, falsifying academic records, and any act designed
to avoid participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same written assignment
for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to
them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who
violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or
dismissal from the University. For more information on scholastic dishonesty, please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site at
