 The online course format allows us to monitor and detect issues involving identity
 verification, collusion and plagiarism. A violation of the course policy may include (but
 is not limited to) the following:
      • Providing your UT EID and password to another person,
                                                                                               N

      • Failing to properly cite ideas, data, or arguments that are not originally yours.

 Please be aware that we are using a software system that automatically detects behavior
 that violates course rules. As part of this effort, we will occasionally send students email  E
 notifications when any problematic behaviors are detected. These emails are intended

mainly to remind students of the course code of conduct, and carry absolutely no
implications for a student’s grade in this course. We will only investigate cases where
                                                                                           S
our system determines that there is a considerable amount of evidence that the code of
conduct is not being followed. Regardless of the results, the faculty member, in
consultation with Student Judicial Services, will make the final determination as to
whether or not a paper has been plagiarized.
Students with Disabilities
Upon request, the University of Texas at Austin provides appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students. It is the student’s responsibility, to make the
instructor aware of any special accommodations or needs in a timely manner. Students
with disabilities may request appropriate accommodations from the Services for
Students with Disabilities at 512-471-6259 (audio) or 512-232-2937 (audiovisual) or
http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/how-to-register-with-ssd/. As soon as you have
received your letter of accommodation, please send a scanned copy to your professor.
Religious Holidays
The instructor complies with University policy regarding religious holidays. Students
must inform the instructor at least 14 days prior to any assignments that they will miss.
Students will be given a reasonable time to make up any items. It remains the student’s
responsibility to complete the modules in a timely fashion.
This course may be used to fulfill three hours of the U.S. history part of the university
core curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by the
Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking
skills, personal responsibility, and social responsibility. This course carries a cultural
diversity flag.
Geographical Literacy
This class will participate in a new History department initiative to improve student
geographical literacy. Geographical literacy helps us to deepen our understanding of
the complex processes of the past when we have a better grasp of time, space and
place. You will do a series of map exercises this semester that reinforce your key
conceptual issues and content knowledge, and you will access those exercises through
Canvas.
