SPECIAL NOTES:
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon receipt appropriate academic adjustments for qualified
students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students 471-6259, 471-
4641 TDD or the College of Engineering Director of Students with Disabilities at 471-4321.
Students should be aware that all required writing assignments may be submitted through a software
program called Turnitin. Turnitin is a software resource designed to help students avoid plagiarism and
improper citation. The software encourages original writing and proper citation documentation practices by
cross-referencing submitted materials with an archived database of journals, essays, newspaper articles,
books, and other published work.
MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION CENTER:
Measurement and Evaluation Center forms for the College of Engineering will be used during the last week
of class to evaluate the course and the instructor.
Mid-way through the semester, an informal evaluation form will be presented to the class. The informal
evaluation will be utilized by the instructor to adapt the class to the needs of the students.

Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT: Therefore, if you use words or idea that are not your own (or
that you have used in a previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of
plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible
for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the
