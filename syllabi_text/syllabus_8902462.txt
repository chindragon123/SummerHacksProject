Course Description:
A girl punished for her crimes with a sloth attached to back, vampires who look like little girls,
and crack cocaine as a character with a wicked sense of humor: this class will use satirical and
slightly off-kilter texts and performances to examine real-life dark forces that plague
contemporary black societies across the world. Moving from Southern Africa to black England
to African America, this class explores not just the meaning of race, gender and sexuality, but
also how those categories of identity can be reimagined given the omnipresent threat that black
lives face. We will pay close attention to both issues of context (historical, socio-economic and
anthropological) as well as to questions of structure and genre. Specifically we will think through
notions of Afrofuturism, addiction, ecological disaster capitalism, thinking through how the ways
black people make and embody art inform the content. The class will also include a large number
of contemporary cultural texts such as music videos, popular dance trends and music.

Requirements:
    1. Attendance and participation are crucial. More than two unexcused absences will be
         penalized. I will be asking for volunteers to look up information throughout the semester
         and this can boost your participation grade. If you keep up with the reading, you should
         do well in this class. However even if you haven’t read, be sure to come to class. Every
         student will have at least one question or point prepared for discussion each class. (10%)
    2. Every student must sign up for one performance based on the reading. Further
         information will be given during class about what this entails. (15%)

         is to visit the Blanton Museum Film and Video Gallery to see Wangechi Mutu’s “The
         End of Eating Everything” that runs from September 15 to November 25, 2018. You
         must also see the accompanying exhibit “Making Africa: A Continent of Contemporary


   Design” on view from Oct 14 to end of semester. For your final paper, you can write on
   the video and exhibit after you get approval from me. (20%)
4. 4 page minimum paper due Oct 18th by one in my office. I will be handing out topics
   later in the semester but students are welcome to come up with their own topics, provided
   I approve them during office hours. Students with late papers will be penalized. (20%)
