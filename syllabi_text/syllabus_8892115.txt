CLASS DESCRIPTION
This course examines theoretical and ethnographic issues facing indigenous peoples around the
world. It will critically examine debates surrounding terms often taken for granted, such as such
as indigeneity, mestizaje, and multiculturalism. The course will also take a historical and
ethnographic approach to analyze the ways in which indigenous peoples have been impacted and
continue to respond to forces such as colonialism and capitalism in different geographical regions
of the Americas. Drawing on topics such as contact and colonial expansion, self-determination
and the nation state, gender, ecologies, social movements, and ontologies, the course will explore
the lived realities of different groups of people, examine the influence of European contact, and
discuss how indigenous peoples are creatively advancing their life projects in different
contexts.
READINGS
Readings for the course can be downloaded from the Canvas course website at
http://courses.utexas.edu/. I will use Canvas to distribute course materials, to communicate and
collaborate online, to post grades, and to submit assignments. You can find support in using
Canvas at the ITS Help Desk at 475-9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., so plan
accordingly.
REQUIREMENTS
1. Attendance and Participation (15%)
Attending and actively participating in class is vital to the learning process. Your active
participation in class is required. You demonstrate your commitment to the class by contributing
respectfully to discussions, including online discussions, and engaging enthusiastically in learning
activities. Attendance will be checked in every class. Students who miss class due to conference
attendance, illness or emergency are required to bring documentation from their healthcare
provider or other relevant, professional third party. Failure to submit third-party documentation
will result in unexcused absences. Note: No student with four (4) unexcused class absences will
pass the class.
2. Reading Responses (20%)
Prior to each class you will prepare a quarter page summary of the reading and a reflection on one
or two issues that made an impression on you and formulate questions you would like to
discuss. Reading responses are designed to help you synthesize complicated arguments,
encourage you to keep up with the readings, and most of all, to help you come to class with ideas,
questions, and thoughts to contribute to discussions. See details in the Guideline for Reading
Responses handout.
                                                                                                   1


Deadline: You will share reflection and questions via the Canvas site by 11 p.m. before the day of
class.
3. In-Class Assignments (15%) Two Class Presentation assignments will be due over the course
of the term. See details in the Guideline for In-Class Assignments handout.
4. Essay Exams (50% total): These will consist of 2 set of essay questions based on class
readings and will take place by Week 9 and at the end of the semester. Details will be discussed
in class.
GRADES
Final grades will be assigned as follows:
A = 94-100 % (of 500 possible points) A- = 90-93
B+ = 87-89                                  B = 84-86        B- = 80-83
C+ = 77-7                                   C = 74-76        C- = 70-73
D+ = 67-69                                  D = 64-66        D- = 60-63
F = 0-60
At the end of the semester once grades are calculated, the professor will round up scores of 0.5
and higher and round down scores of less than 0.5. Students who wish to contest a grade must do
so 48 hours after an exam grade is handed out to ensure students fully review the exam and
comments indicating where they made a mistake. The deadline to contact TA and/or Professor to
contest grades will be within two weeks of the day on which the exams are handed back in class
and/or grades are posted on canvas.
Note on Incompletes
Incomplete (I) grades are given only in documented emergency cases (usually only for a death in
the family, major illness or injury, or birth of your child), and if the student has completed the
majority of the coursework (usually everything but the final paper). If you encounter any
difficulty that might prevent you completing the coursework, please do not wait until the end of
the term; contact the instructor immediately.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND OTHER UNIVERSITY POLICIES
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University,
policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines academic
dishonesty as basically all conduct that violates this standard, including any act designed to give
an unfair or undeserved academic advantage, such as:
• Cheating
• Plagiarism (Links to an external site.)
• Unauthorized Collaboration / Collusion (Links to an external site.)
• Falsifying Academic Records
• Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain an
     extended deadline for an assignment, or even gain an unearned financial benefit)
• Multiple submissions (Links to an external site.) (e.g., submitting essentially the same written
     assignment for two courses without authorization to do so)
• Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity
                                                                                                    2

Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside
when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following
policies regarding evacuation:
• Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the
     nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
• If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
• In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT
Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
Class Technology Policy: Cell phones must be silenced and put away. If I notice otherwise, you
will be marked absent. You may use a laptop to take notes. However, it should not be used for
anything else during class. If the teaching assistant or a peer tells me your actions on your laptop
are distracting during a lecture, you will lose the privilege to work on your laptop during class.
Please note: I reserve the right to change or amend the course syllabus as necessary.
