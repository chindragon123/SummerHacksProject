GENERAL INFORMATION
Meeting Times: MWF 1:00–2:00pm
Meeting Location: Patton Hall (RLP) 1.106
Instructor: Professor Jonathan Kaplan
Course Description:
For almost seventy years, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has influenced significantly our
understanding of Second Temple Judaism, the formation of the Bible, and the origins of the
religious movements of Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. This course presents an in-depth study
of the Dead Sea Scrolls in order to understand better the development of law, interpretation,
ritual, messianism, apocalypticism, and prayer in the late Second Temple period. This course will
include discussion of the archaeology of the Qumran community, textual production and
transmission in antiquity, scribal practices in antiquity, and pseudonymous authorship.
Prerequisites:
None
Global Cultures Flag:
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your
familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and
histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Learning Goals:
After completing this course successfully, students should be able to:
• Outline the development of Jewish history between the third century B.C.E. and the second
     century C.E.
• Give an overview of the types of literature found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.
• Describe the history of the group associated with the Dead Sea Scrolls.
• Situate the practices and ideas described in the Dead Sea Scrolls in the landscape of Second
     Temple Judaism.
• Articulate at least three ways that the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has contributed to
     our understanding of the development of the Bible and interpretive practices in antiquity.
Course Websites:
In this class I use Canvas – a Web-based course management system with password-protected
access at http://canvas.utexas.edu – to distribute course materials, to communicate and
collaborate online, etc. You can find support in using Canvas at the ITS Help Desk at (512) 475-
9400, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., so plan accordingly.

Major Course Requirements and Assignments:
(1) Participation counts for ten percent of the course grade, and one cannot participate if he or
     she is not in class. That being said, I understand that students sometimes miss class. More
     than two unexcused absences will result in a lowering of a student’s participation grade. If
     you are going to be absent from class, please contact the teaching assistant as soon as
     feasible and provide any documentation for an excused absence. If there is a personal or
     medical reason for multiple absences, please alert me. I understand that students may be
     hesitant to speak in class for a variety of reasons. If students have any concerns about class
     participation and would like to meet with me to discuss alternative ways to participate
     and/or strategies to improve class participation, please do not hesitate to contact me.
(2) Mid-term test – The format of this test will consist of identifications (terms and passages), a
     map section, and short essays. This test will be given on Wednesday, March 13 during class.
(3) Two 3–4 page papers – These papers will involve close readings of a primary source chosen
     from the assignments listed on the syllabus and discussed in class. Specific instructions will
     be passed out in-class. Papers will be due on the following dates during the semester:
     Monday, February 25 and Monday, May 6.
(4) Cumulative three-hour final exam – Requested with the registrar’s office. I will let you know
     as soon as I know. It will likely be held on Wednesday, May 15, 2:00–5:00pm.
“House Style”:
All written assignments for this class are to be formatted according to the following house style:
     • Font: Arial, 11pt
     • Margins: 1 inch
     • Page Size: 8.5” x 11”
     • Line Spacing: Double
     • Page numbers: wherever you prefer in either the header or the footer.

cell phones, etc.) during class sessions for specific course-related activities only. The instructor

CLASS SESSIONS AND COURSE SCHEDULE
Ground Rules for Participation in Discussion:
This course is a critical introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is important to emphasize that
the course does not expect students to have a particular religious perspective. Students who
have such a perspective are encouraged to bring their own experiences into the classroom
while respecting the opinions (and individuals) that may challenge those views. As such, I ask
that during class discussions you (1) listen carefully and respectfully to the viewpoints of your
classmates; (2) make sure you understand the position offered by your classmate (asking
clarification questions if necessary) before responding; and (3) offer your contributions to the
conversation respectfully and in the interests of advancing critical, academic discussion.
Course Outline (subject to change):
Note: Assigned readings must be completed before the date on which they are to be discussed
in class! Do not SKIM the readings from ancient texts (i.e., selections from Josephus, the Bible,
or the Dead Sea Scrolls). They must be read S-L-O-W-L-Y, or else you will not understand them
or be able to articulate what you do not understand about them.

Assignments turned in after their deadline will be accepted but with a reduction in grade on the
assignment equal to one-third of a letter grade per day (or portion of a day that an assignment
is late). For instance, if an assignment is due at 1 p.m. on a Friday and a student turns the
assignment in the following Monday at 9 a.m., the assignment will be considered three days
late, and its grade will be reduced by one full letter grade.
Accessible Education:
The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. You will need to provide
documentation to the Dean of Student’s Office so that the most appropriate accommodations
can be determined. Specialized services are available on campus through Services for Students
with Disabilities (SSB 4.104, 512-471-6259). Any student who requires special accommodations
must obtain a letter that documents the disability from the Services for Students with
Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement (512-471-6259 voice
or 512-471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). Present the letter to the
professor at the beginning of the semester so that needed accommodations can be discussed.
The student should remind the professor of any testing accommodations no later than five
business days before an exam. For more information, visit
