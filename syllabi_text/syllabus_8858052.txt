Description: The Indian Subcontinent can teach us a great deal about diversity in the cultures of
the past, as well as the political conditions that can lead to the disappearance of such diversity.
For these reasons, we need to understand the carving out of the Indian subcontinent into separate
political units called India and Pakistan respectively (in 1947-50). The course begins with ‘caste’
and ‘religion’ in the subcontinent, moves to the gradual consolidation of British colonialism, the
redrawing of social, economic, religious, political boundaries and identities and ends with the
growth of modern political forms such as political parties, and end with the cataclysms of
Partition in 1947.
Aims: 1) to acquaint students with basic concepts and a basic chronology of events, people, and
processes.
2) familiarize students with an understanding of the differences between ‘primary’ and
‘secondary’ sources in the understanding of any past
3) teach students to think critically by exposing them to a variety of perspectives on the past,
including some key controversies around each of the themes of the course.
Requirements. On days marked ‘Read’ in the syllabus, students are required to read a
compulsory number of pages in a given text in each topic before they come to class. They will
