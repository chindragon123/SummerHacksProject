                    A plus or minus grading scale will be used to assign final grades, with an

                        1. The exams will be administered during the times outlined in this
                            syllabus calendar. Please reserve these times in advance so that you
                            do not have a conflict during a scheduled exam. You must sit for the
                            exams on the dates and times scheduled. If an extraordinary event
                            (death in immediate family, illness requiring hospitalization, etc.),
                            contact me before the exam and I will resolve on an individual basis.
           Exams        2. Exams will test the material covered since the last exam; however,
                            due to the integrated nature of tax law, there may be a
                            comprehensive element to each exam.
                        3. During each exam you may use a calculator, your text, notes, and
                            any printed material you wish to bring. You may not bring your
                            laptop, tablet, cell phone or other PDA device to exams.
                        There is assigned reading for each class meeting and you are expected
                        to come prepared to discuss the material.
  Outside Reading
    and Problems        Problems are included in each chapter and the solutions to the problems
                        are posted on Canvas. Although these problems will not be collected or


                      graded, you are expected to attempt these problems as they will help you
                      learn the material and prepare for the exams.
                 A U.S. Return of Partnership Income (Form 1065) will be assigned and
                 completed in groups. All information will be provided for you to prepare the
     Tax Return return, including a list of the forms and schedules required. These forms are
                 available at www.irs.gov in fill-out and print format. Tax preparation software
                 is NOT permitted.
                 Students will work in groups on a project that will be assigned mid-semester.
  Group Project This project will incorporate tax research, comprehension and analysis,
                 critical thinking, creative presentation development and communication skills.
                 In calculating your final grade, 100 points will come from your display of
                 professionalism in my class. This discretionary evaluation will be based
                 upon the following:
                      • Class attendance
                      • Participating in class discussions
                      • Evidence of preparedness by responding to class questions
