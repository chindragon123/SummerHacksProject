Course Description:
A child born when the door between the spirit and material world was swinging open, 100 year
old vampires who look like little girls, and crack cocaine as a character with a wicked sense of
humor: this class will use satirical and slightly off-kilter texts and performances to examine real-
life dark forces that plague contemporary black societies across the world. Moving from
Southern Africa to black England to African America, this class explores not just the meaning of
race, gender and sexuality, but also how those categories of identity can be reimagined given the
omnipresent threat that black lives face. We will pay close attention to both issues of context
(historical, socio-economic and anthropological) as well as to questions of structure and genre.
Specifically we will think through notions of Afrofuturism, addiction, ecological disaster
capitalism, thinking through how the ways black people make and embody art inform the content.
The class will also include a large number of contemporary cultural texts such as music videos,
popular dance trends and music.

Requirements:
   1. Attendance and participation are crucial. More than two unexcused absences will be
       penalized. I will be asking for volunteers to look up information throughout the semester
       and this can boost your participation grade. If you keep up with the reading, you should
       do well in this class. However even if you haven’t read, be sure to come to class. Every
       student should have at least one question or point prepared for discussion each class.
       (10%)
   2. Every student must sign up for one performance based on the readings and short
       assignments. Performances should be approximately five minutes and no longer than ten.
       Further information will be given during class about what this entails. This will be
       accompanied by short writing assignment d below. (15%)
   3. Students will be given four creative short assignments. (20%)
       a. Please write a short piece on the relationship between your race and your sexuality.
            How does your understanding of your racial positioning impact the way you think
            about your body and sexual intimacy? OR. Describe how your race impacts your
            gender? This is a personal reflective essay. (2 pages)
       b. Students must attend the exhibit “In Their Own Form” at the Christian Green Gallery
            and Idea Lab. They must choose one piece to write about, keeping in mind the
            themes of the class. Please provide a copy of the image. (2 pages not including
            image)
       c. Write a scene for a play based on Rivers Solomon’s An Unkindness of Ghosts. This
            scene should take place between Aster and her dead mother or Aster and Giselle. Be
            sure to utilize the gender-neutral language and dialect that Aster uses and to
            incorporate aspects of Aster’s neuroatypicality. This must be 4 pages long.
       d. Written component of performance requirement. If students are enacting a scene
            from one of the novels, they must provide me with a script. If they physically
            perform, I need some sort of written choreography. In addition to a treatment,
            students must explain why they chose the genre of performance, what were the
            challenges putting together the performance and what did they feel was the most
            successful aspect of the performance. This should be a minimum of four pages.
   4. 5 page minimum paper due March 12th by one in my office. I will be handing out
       topics later in the semester but students are welcome to come up with their own topics,
       provided I approve them during office hours. Students with late papers will be penalized.
       (20%)
   5. 8 page final comparative paper, due on May 7th by one in my office. Topics will be
       distributed later in the semester. There will be no final exam for this class. This is a
       comparative paper that requires outside sources and must include a bibliography and
       works cited page. I do not grade late final papers. (35%)
