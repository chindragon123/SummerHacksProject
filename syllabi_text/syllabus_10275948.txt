Course Description:
This graduate seminar deals with the cultural analysis of sexuality. Its aim is to evaluate
critically formative concepts and theories that have been subject to debates within
Anthropology, History, Philosophy, and Gender Studies/Queer Theory. Through the
reading of a variety of texts, including scholarly and literary ones, we will explore the
central position sexuality occupies within culture. By discussing recent works covering
Feminism and Critical Gender Studies, we will examine the ways in which the nation and
the state, as well as social and racial relationships, are closely tied to the politics of
sexuality. We will look at how bodies marked by pivotal concepts such as gender, race,
desire, and class are situated in particular places and times. One of the basic themes of
the material for this seminar concerns the extent to which both realities and their
perceptions are socio-cultural constructs that are subject to constant change and,
therefore, need historical and anthropological contextualization. Throughout the
semester, students will be writing their final course paper in four different stages on an
original topic pertaining to the subject of the class and connected to their respective
research projects.

Course Requirements for Registered Students:
The class relies on the intellectual commitment and active participation of all students.
It will be run as discussions within a seminar format. In order for the course to be
effective, all students must have the reading assignments completed and ready for in-
depth discussion for each meeting. Regular attendance is required. Attendance in class,
however, does not constitute participation. You must come to class having carefully
read all materials and be prepared to discuss, question, and argue about issues raised in
the readings. It will be beneficial for you to take excerpts/notes on any material that you
find enlightening, controversial, or objectionable. You should also take notes in class on
themes, key terms, and debates we tackle. These note-taking strategies will be crucial
when you write the different drafts of your term paper. Moreover, for each class that
warrants a discussion based on assigned readings, two students will be responsible to
launch the general discussion with a 15-20 minutes presentation that summarizes the
work, engages with a key concept raised in the text, and comes up with a set of two
questions to be responded to by the rest of the class. Finally, the research paper will be
written in four different stages. For that, the students will share their different drafts
with the other members of the class who will discuss them during the indicated dates. In
short:
                                                                                           2


1) Do all assigned readings by the date indicated on the syllabus and participate actively
in the general class discussion.
2) Regular two presentations (15-20 minutes combined) on the weekly readings
assigned to students. They are meant to launch the general seminar discussions.
3) Three different drafts of the research paper (which are intended to build upon each
other) to be sent electronically to the entire class on Thursdays and presented and
discussed in front of all members of the seminar on Monday, February 17th (4 pages),
Monday, March 9th (8 pages), and April 6th (15 pages). On Monday, May 4th (up to 20
pages), the final draft will be discussed. Again, all drafts need to be shared
electronically on Thursday before class. Focused topics on your own scholarly interests
that raise a central research issue or query are best. Avoid general or overview topics. If
the paper is theoretical, you must include around 25% of the readings in your paper.
4) Give and Receive active feedback on the respective written texts to and from your
peers.
The writing assignment, that will take place in different stages over the entire semester,
is designed to develop critical reading, analytical, and writing skills, but also form- and
content-based creativity. Evaluation criteria include, but are not limited to, critical and
integrative analysis of texts, clarity of thought, ability to synthesize readings and,
occasionally, class discussions into your own argument, and ability to formulate a
theoretical and creative grounding for it. Every student is encouraged to visit the
University Writing Center (UWC: http://uwc.utexas.edu/).
