                                             Course Description
This course will provide an overview of theoretical and practical perspectives on the nature of language in
    education, its use and usage. Students will explore principles of discourse, phonology, morphology,
    syntax and semantics as they relate to second language acquisition. We will also cover language
    varieties, social conventions and linguistic structures. The focus of the course is to prepare pre-service
    teachers to best meet the ​linguistic and academic needs of bilingual English learner (EL) students
    in the K-12 classroom.
Topics include English structures and analysis, identification of bilingual EL students’ academic and
    linguistic learning needs, and pedagogical strategies to promote language acquisition. Our beliefs
    about the English language and its acquisition shape the kinds of opportunities we provide our
    bilingual EL students and are therefore highly consequential to their academic trajectories. This
    course is structured to support the student in designing, implementing and reflecting on the academic
    language development of bilingual EL students in a variety of contexts.
                                                Course Goals
By the end of the semester, the successful student will be able to:
    1. Discuss the complexities of the English language.
    2. Explain English language structures and patterns.
    3. Critically analyze the linguistic features of a bilingual EL student’s oral language sample.
    4. Understand language as a sociopolitical and historical construct.
    5. Appreciate varieties of the English language and its ongoing transformation.
    6. Identify the linguistic challenges facing bilingual EL students in the academic context
    7. Design activities appropriate to bilingual EL students’ linguistic needs in the academic context
    8. Identify attitudes towards, and modes of inquiry regarding language
    9. Articulate theories of language (e.g. variation, phonology, social conventions, use/usage)
    10. Identify instructional strategies to address bilinguals’ academic & linguistic development.

Use of e-mail and ​Canvas​ are essential elements of this class. Successful completion of this
course requires that you record a language sample from your bilingual EL student for
transcription and analysis. Projects and assignments must be submitted electronically, posted to
the class ​Canvas​ website. E-mail will be used to communicate with Katherine & Randy and
other class members. A ​Canvas​ Site has been established for this course; the site contains a copy
of this syllabus, project guidelines, readings which are not in your textbooks, and general course
information. Announcements, updates, and new documents will be posted throughout the course;
students are expected to check ​Canvas​ regularly. Students are encouraged to post their own
presentations to the group presentation folder on ​Canvas​ so others in the class may have access
to them. All students must post to ​Canvas​ their ​critical commentaries​ ​by​ ​9:00am on the day
they are due so that Katherine & Randy can review them before class. (See below for more
details.)
                                             Attendance
Regular attendance and participation is required. One class absence is acceptable; each
subsequent class absence will result in a ​3-point reduction of the final grade​.
If you absolutely have to miss a class session, talk to me before about your plans for keeping up
    with the coursework and compensating—not eliminating—the absence. You are responsible
    for contacting a class member so that you are prepared for the next class session. When you
    come to class, please sign in on the attendance sheet. Tardies will also lower your final grade
    for this class.

                                      Linguistic Analysis (30%)
Students will display their understanding of both (1) the distinct structure and features of oral
English, and (2) the linguistic development of bilingual EL students by analyzing a language
sample from a tutoring session with their student. Language samples will include approximately
10 minutes of discussion around an academic or social topic. Claims made in the linguistic
analyses must be supported by ​references​ drawn from course readings as well as external texts.
Final projects will consist of 4 discrete sections:
Introduction
How do you connect with your student? What have you learned about yourself and your student
beyond our course teachings? What kind of EL/bilingual instruction does your student
experience? How has this experience influenced your perspective on language and culture in the
community? Connect to course readings as possible. (1.5-2 p.) ​(cont.)
Linguistic Analysis.​
Critical analysis of your student’s linguistic development as represented in the language sample:
     1. Phonological development
     2. Morphological development
     3. Syntactic development (cont.)
     4. S​emantic development
     5. Pragmatic competence (e.g., discourse routines, social conventions).
     6. Free choice: anything else that strikes you as important--Analysis of additional features
         not listed but studied this semester are welcome. ​(​Maximum 5 pages; Minimum 10 references)
Recommended Classroom Practices.
                     i. Describe 2-3 recommended instructional strategies for working with your
                        bilingual EL student.
                    ii. Strategies should target improving content area development and
                        comprehension based on your work together.

SOLOM Results and Discussion.
Throughout your classroom observations and tutoring sessions, take the time to chat in English.
Analyze the how and why of your participant’s SOLOM results. How (well) does the SOLOM
measure a learner’s use of: syntax, semantics, morphology, phonology, language use/usage?
Which features of the EL student’s oral language prompted the rater to place him/her at each
level in each domain? How well do ratings in the individual language ability areas reflect the
overall assessment? What questions did the SOLOM answer for you as a teacher? Were any
areas of concern left unaddressed? (1-2 pages; min. 2 references)

In the 2nd week of your tutoring experience, you will record a ​language sample​ with your
        bilingual student.
You will not be interviewing your student, rather you will be recording a regular tutoring
        session. You will then transcribe this language sample, both your language and your
        student’s, and use this as the base of your linguistic analysis. (cont.)
Print out a copy of your ​transcript​ and bring this to class with you. You will use the language
elicited from the L2 learner to identify various linguistic features we examine in class. In class,
we will workshop our transcripts, looking for examples of:
                Pragmatic competence
                Semantic development
                Phonological development
                Morphological development
                Syntactic development (cont.)
As you work with your EL student throughout the semester, reflect on his/her language growth
        and development. At the end of the semester, you will evaluate your student’s English
        proficiency based on the SOLOM rubric. The ​SOLOM​ allows a teacher to observe an EL
        student’s oral English skills in a natural context and identify the appropriate English
        language development stage through observation.
