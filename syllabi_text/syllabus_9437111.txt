Course Routine
     I will conduct the course by giving lectures, facilitating in-class exercises, and conducting discussions in a manner
     that encourages class participation by students, consistent with the objectives of the course and the time available.
     Students are expected to study the chapter readings before topics are introduced in class and do assigned homework
     questions, exercises and problems to reinforce what they learn.
Homework
     Homework will consist of reading the text book and some internet research.
Academic Standards
     A high academic level will be maintained with respect to (a) the quality of the course and (b) grading. Semester
     grades will be determined using the following factors and relative weights:
    Exam I                     40%
    Exam II                    40%
    Quizzes                    10%
    Class Project              10%
                   Total      100%
E-mail
    I will use the e-mail addresses that are supplied to me on Canvas. If you normally use a different e-mail address,
    please make sure the UT email address you have given the registrar is set up for forwarding. Any outside-of-class
    announcements that I make (e.g., corrections or clarifications of items discussed in class, syllabus changes, quiz
    announcements, etc.) will be sent to you via e-mail.
Dropping the Course
    Students must go through the official procedures to drop the course. A student who stops attending the class and fails
    to officially drop will receive a grade of F. Consult the Academic Calendar on the Registrar’s website
    (http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/cals.html) for specific deadlines.
                                                  Students with Disabilities
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641

                                               Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The McCombs School of Business and the department of accounting have no tolerance for acts of scholastic
dishonesty. The responsibilities of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in
detail in the Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty for the CBA.
By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all of the faculty responsibilities described in that document. By
enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all of the student responsibilities described in that document. If
the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear in any way, it is your
responsibility to ask me for clarification. Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty: Students who violate University rules
on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course
and/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the
University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to: copying tests or assignments, representing (copying) the work
                                                                                                                           2


of another person as one's own or allowing another person to represent your work as their own, collaborating
without authority with another student during an exam or in preparing academic work, using or having on your
desk unauthorized materials or aids to complete a quiz or exam (e.g., cheat sheets, solutions, graphing or
programmable calculators, pagers, cellular telephones, Palms, etc), continuing work on an exam after a stop time
has been announced, etc.
Students are expected to adhere to a strict ethical standard in this course.
You should refer to the Student Judicial Services website at: http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/ or the General
Information catalog to access the official University policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as
further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
                                                     Electronic Class Rosters
An opinion from the US Department of Education states that the University must inform students in advance if their name
will be appearing on an electronic class roster:
    Since Fall 2001, web-based, password-protected class sites have been available for all accredited courses taught at
    The University. Syllabi, handouts, assignments and other resources are types of information that may be available
    within these sites. Site activities could include exchanging e-mail, engaging in class discussions and chats, and
    exchanging files. In addition, class e-mail rosters will be a component of the sites. Students who do not want their
    names included in these electronic class rosters must restrict their directory information in the Office of the Registrar,
    Main Building, Room 1. For information on restricting directory information see:
    http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi00-01/app/appc09.html. Privacy in Canvas: Information in Canvas
    is protected by your UTEID login. Please be aware that I will use a merged Canvas site for all sections of the course
    that I am teaching this semester. This will allow students in other sections to see that you are enrolled in the course
    and send you email from within Canvas. However, they will not actually learn your email address and no other
    personal data will be revealed through Canvas. If you have any concerns, please contact the ITS Help Desk at 475-
    9400 for help removing your name from view of other students.
    The University delegates to individual faculty members responsibility for and authority over classroom procedure and
    decorum. Due to the distraction that can be caused, use of laptops, tablets and cell phones, or any other such
    equipment is not allowed during class time (unless it is an accommodation specified by the Office of Services for
    Students with Disabilities). All such equipment should be turned off and put away at the start of class.
                                                                                                                             3
