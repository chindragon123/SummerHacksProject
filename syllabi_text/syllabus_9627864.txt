           H. UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE & DEPARTMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:
Profanity Policy
At NO time during the duration of the course shall profanity be tolerated especially
usage directed toward any students, staff, faculty or official agent of the course or
facility. Pending on the severity of the incident, person violating this policy will be asked
to leave the class immediately. The return to class will be determined by the instructor
of record of the course.
Sexual Harassment
It is the policy of the University to maintain an educational environment free of sexual
harassment and intimidation (Rev; HOP, 4.A.3, June 3, 2003). The General Policy
Guidelines and Procedures for Reporting and Responding to Sexual Misconduct can be
found at http://www.utexas.edu/policies/hoppm/04.A.03.html.
Students with Disabilities
Services for Students with Disabilities is the area on campus responsible for
determining eligibility and implementing reasonable accommodations for students with
disabilities at the University of Texas. Federal law is clear on this matter and applies to
all students with disabilities. SSD works with undergraduate and graduate students and
serves as a resource to faculty, other University departments, agencies, and the Austin
area community. Housed in the Office of the Dean of Students, located on the fourth
floor of the Student Services Building, the staff (471-6259; TTY471-4641) can assist
both students and faculty or staff who have questions about these obligations.


Academic Dishonesty
Scholastic dishonesty will not be tolerated and that incidents of dishonesty will be
reported. When a faculty member suspects a student of cheating, published guidelines
(available from the Office of the Dean of Students) should be followed. Faculty can
virtually eliminate cheating by specifying the ground rules, by challenging students to
practice education ethics, and by creating environments that discourage cheating. It is
recommended that faculty include the Honor Code in course syllabi. The Honor Code
can be found at http://www.utexas.edu/welcome/mission/html

Although exercise testing and participation are relatively safe for most apparently healthy individuals under age forty-five,
the reaction of the cardiovascular system to increased levels of physical activity cannot always be totally predicted.
Consequently, there is a small but real risk of certain changes occurring during exercise testing and participation. Some
of these changes may include abnormal pressure, irregular heart rhythm, fainting, and in rare instances, a heart attack or
cardiac arrest. Therefore, it is imperative that you provide honest answers to this questionnaire. Exercise may be
contraindicated under some of the conditions listed below, others may simply require special consideration. If any of the
conditions apply, consult your physician before you participate in an exercise program. Also, promptly report to your
instructor any exercise related abnormalities that you may experience during regular exercise participation.
          Have you ever had           __ Uneven, irregular, or       Do you suffer from           Do any of the

c. increase resistance to the water.
d. decrease stroke efficiency.
10. _____ The first thing you should do if you unexpectedly find yourself immersed in water is
a. begin to tread as slowly as you can.          c. get out of the water if possible
b. survival float.                               d. swim to safety.
 11. _____ How many lengths of the pool is 450 yards?
a. 25 b. 14 c. 16 d. 18
TRUE OR FALSE
PLEASE CIRCLE THE CORRECT ANSWER
T or F 12.       The resistance your body creates in moving through the water
      is known as drag.
T or F 13.       Swimming with one's head out of the water will create poor
      body alignment with the water and increase a swimmer's
      drag.
T or F 14.       The use of bi-lateral rhythmic breathing helps to develop proper
      rolling on both sides of the crawl stroke and will improve stroke
      mechanics.
T or F 15.       An advantage of swimming is that it requires the continuous
      use of more of your body's major muscle groups than do most
      other forms of exercise.
T or F 16.       The difference between most competitive and non-
      competitive strokes is the amount of gliding used in the
      stroke.
T or F 17. Drag is only important in the horizontal position.
T or F 18. Backstroke, Breaststroke, and Freestyle are the ONLY
      competitive strokes.
T or F 19. The correct sequence for swimming the breaststroke is
                 Pull - Breathe - Kick – Glide - 123.
T or F 20. The water is wet.


                            Sports Nutrition 101
Terms
•  “CHO” = carbohydrate - breads, pasta, candy, soda, potatoes, corn, cereal
•  Kcal = kilocalories = Calories
•  Nutrition Label measures in grams = g
•  Glycemic Index - a measure of how quickly CHO enters bloodstream.
    – High G.I foods = candy, soda, potatoes, bread, Gatorade, raisins
    – Low G.I foods = most fruit, beans, milk, ice cream
                                 Energy Costs of Activity
•  During Swimming 400 kcal/1600 m (also depends on VO2 during workout)
   versus
•  During Running 100 kcal/mile (depends on body weight)
                                      Exercise Fuels
•  “Light-Moderate” (50-60% VO2max): Half Fat/Half CHO
•  “Intense” (70-90% VO2max) : Mostly CHO from muscle glycogen
                                   Endurance Training
•  For same absolute VO2, one uses more fat and less CHO. Muscle glycogen
   sparing prevents fatigue
•  As one gets “fitter,” fat supply increasingly comes from intramuscular
   triglycerides (readily available!)
                            General Protein recommendations
• For sedentary to moderately active .8g/kg body weight
• For weight-lifting performance 1-1.5 g/kg body weight
• For endurance athlete 2g/kg body weight
                                           Fat?
• Excess CHO is stored as saturated fat (palmitate). So, you might as well eat some
polyunsaturated fats (good fat) because your body uses these for cellular maintenance
and repair. E.g. avocado, salmon, olive oil. FDA recommends no more than 30% diet
from fat


                          CHO Recommendations for Performance
                                         Before Exercise
  • 1g/kg CHO. Individual preferences. Gastric tolerance varies.
  Glycemic index irrelevant, but low GI may be detrimental. Eat what you like (probably avoid fat –
  slows gastric emptying), bring a CHO supplement for exercise lasting more than 45-60 minutes
  (Or CHO + Pro for exercise exceeding 2 hrs.
• 2.2 lb. = 1kg
• 50 g CHO
  3-4 slices of bread
  1 bagel
  1 poptart
  1 liter Gatorade
  Check “Nutrition Information” on pre-packaged foods
                                      Pre - Exercise Meal
•  You don’t HAVE to eat before exercise.
•  Some people WANT to eat before intense exercise to ensure blood glucose is
   maintained.
•  Other people CAN’T tolerate food in stomach while exercising.
                                         During Exercise
• 30-60 g CHO during (1 liter of [Gatorade])/hour
• For exercise exceeding 2 hours, 4:1 CHO:Protein ratio (Accelerade, Perpetuem)
•  Try food during training before you race
                                          After Exercise
•  1.5-2 g CHO/kg body weight (high glycemic index CHO best) every two hours
   until your next big meal which includes 300g CHO
•  Best to eat CHO + Protein to maximize insulin response which maximally
   replaces muscle glycogen @ 7-8%/hour (not very fast!)
                                              Fluids
•  ACSM recommends “enough fluid to replace fluid loss”
•  A more practical recommendation is to drink about 1 liter/hour
•  If you are unsure, weight yourself before and after exercise to measure fluid
   loss
                                 Dehydration and Hyponatremia
• Too little water or too little salt


         • Bottom line – either condition impairs performance significantly!
                                      Weight Loss?
                       •1 pound fat = approximately 3500 kcals
  • Have to be in caloric deficit to lose weight, period. The composition of your
kcals is irrelevant. Diets like Atkins and South Beach are caloric restriction. Meat
  makes you feel full, dieters get to eat “forbidden foods” like cheese and meat.
   They are able to calorically restrict, so they are successful at losing weight.
     •Do not attempt to lose more than 2 lbs per week. Even 1 lb per week is
  aggressive. 1 lb per week can be accomplished by eating 250 fewer kcals and
              exercising 250 more kcals per day for 7 days (3500 kcals).
