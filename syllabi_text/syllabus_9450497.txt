improve their pronunciation of Arabic. Homework will include parsing, translation, oral
recitation, dictionary work, and root/form identification. Prerequisites: 3rd semester Arabic
proficiency.

Preparedness and Participation
• This class only meets 15 times in the semester, so attendance at every session is required. If
you miss class, you will lose the participation point for that day, and must find a way to submit
your written homework to me by the end of the class period.
• You are expected to be prepared for each week’s session – i.e. to have prepared both the
grammar lesson and the Qur’an lesson. Expect to be called on in class, such as to recite/read
aloud, answers questions, etc.
• Voluntary participation will be considered as part of this grade, i.e. offering to read, offering
answers, etc.


Written homework: WG (written grammar) and WQ (written Qur’an)
• Written Arabic homework must be submitted at the end of the class period that it is due.
Written Arabic homework must be handwritten, neatly, on lined paper. All Arabic homework
must include full vocalization (taskhkīl, voweling), and answered should be
numbered/labeled as appropriate.
         - Parsing of Arabic grammar sentences should be done on print-outs of the
         Exercises – i.e. as mark-ups of the texts.
         - Written Qur’an exercises should be done on separate pages – i.e. not on print-
         outs of the verses.
• Written English homework must be submitted before the start of class on Canvas.
• It is advisable to keep a binder for your Arabic homework over the term, for reference and
study purposes.
• Written homework will be graded on correctness, grammar, and legibility.
Oral homework: OG (oral grammar) and OQ (oral Qur’an)
• Oral homework must be submitted via Canvas as audio recordings on indicated due dates.
• All oral submissions must include full vocalization and be numbered/labeled as appropriate.
• Oral submissions will be graded on correctness, grammar, and pronunciation.
Recitation Test
On the final class day, each student will be asked to analyze and recite a passage. The passage
will be distributed on that day in class and students will have a few minutes to analyze it, and
then will be called upon to recite it individually. Analysis will be graded on correctness.
Recitation will be graded on precision and pronunciation.
IMPORTANT: Tackling the Material
• Read each chapter carefully. Make sure you understand every point.
• Learn all vocabulary introduced in each chapter. Do as follows:
- Group words into nouns, adjectives, verbs, prepositions, adverbs, and particles. Learn words
in their groups.
- Use the five “senses” of language learning: speaking, listening, reading, writing, imagining.
• Test your passive recall and your active recall of vocabulary.
