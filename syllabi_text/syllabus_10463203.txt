Course Objectives:
KIN f349 carries three undergraduate competency flags: writing, global culture, and
independent inquiry. It takes a multi-cultural approach to the study of sports and emphasizes
the contributions of diverse peoples to the development of our American sport history. The
course is particularly focused on the rise of sport in ancient Greece and Rome and how those
civilizations shaped the modern world of sport. It is hoped that the course will enhance
students’ knowledge & understanding of the following:
    1. The meaning of history, why it matters, and how to “do” historical analysis.
    2. The origins of sport and sport traditions in Ancient Greece and Rome and how those
        cultures influenced modern sports and the Olympic movement.
    3. The evolution and unique features of sport in American society.
    4. The role that gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic class have played in determining
        people’s sporting and exercise practices.
                                                                                              1

Lecture Schedule and Allowances:
Owing to the Disruptions caused by Covid-19 the University has advised staff and students to
stay away from Campus and maintain social distancing. This has, for obvious reasons,
impacted how this course can be taught but also taken. If you are struggling to keep on top
of the workload and/or the readings please email me right away. Together we can work
through difficulties and ensure you both enjoy and complete the course.
I am also aware that studying away from Campus will not be easy for many of you with
family or work commitments. Due to this, our classes will blend live and recorded materials.
We meet from 10am to 12.30pm each day and a rough daily schedule will be as follows
  Time                                                Subject
  10am – c. 10.45am                                   Live Lecture

UT Writing Center:
I strongly encourage you to use the Undergraduate Writing Center, FAC 211, 471-6222:
http://www.uwc.utexas.edu/). The Undergraduate Writing Center offers free, individualized,
expert help with writing for any UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis.
Any undergraduate enrolled in a course at UT can visit the UWC for assistance with any
writing project. They work with students from every department on campus, for both
academic and non-academic writing. Whether you are writing a lab report, a resume, a term
paper, a statement for an application, or your own poetry, UWC consultants will be happy to
work with you. Their services are not just for writing with "problems." Getting feedback
from an informed audience is a normal part of a successful writing project. Consultants help
students develop strategies to improve their writing. The assistance they provide is intended
to foster independence. Each student determines how to use the consultant's advice. The
consultants are trained to help you work on your writing in ways that preserve the integrity of
your work.
University Policies
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a
student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the
University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT.
Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous
class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to
academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be
found at the following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Religious Holidays
Section 51.911 states that a student shall be excused from attending classes or other required
activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including travel
for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be
penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an
assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the
absence. University policy requires students to notify each of their instructors as far in
advance of the absence as possible so that arrangements can be made.
                                                                                                 6


       The University of Texas at Austin Department of Kinesiology & Health Education
Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the
Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law,
you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For
more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we
all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or
exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to
meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. There are also a range of resources
on campus:
CARE Counseling
CARE is a program through the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center. It is common to
need support when dealing with feelings and problems that seem beyond your
control. CARE Counselors are available to help with a variety of issues that may serve as a
barrier to your academic success. Your CARE Counselor in the College of Education is
Danie White, LPC, LMFT. Her office is in the George I. Sanchez Building, SZB 212E. To
schedule an appointment, call 512-232-6862 and ask to schedule a CARE appointment. If
you leave a voice mail, please include your name, EID, and contact number. Walk-in hours
are also available on Mondays and Wednesdays from 1 - 2 PM in JES A115 and Tuesdays
and Fridays from 1 – 2 PM in SZB 216. You will check–in at the Front Desk, and they will
let Danie know you're waiting. All services are confidential. None of your information will
be shared without your written consent. Come by and see us, we are here to listen.
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there
are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have
medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in
case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an
effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs
with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If
appropriate, also contact Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-
866-329- 3986 (video phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
                                                                                                7


       The University of Texas at Austin Department of Kinesiology & Health Education
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you
achieve your goals and cope with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many
helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is
learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings
like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.
