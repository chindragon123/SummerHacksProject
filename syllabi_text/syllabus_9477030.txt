                     Welcome to ALD 321: Play in Early Development
This course is designed to examine play from a variety of political, anthropological,
sociological, educational and social justice perspectives. In an era where play is increasingly
disappearing in schools and neighborhoods, it is essential that anyone who cares about or
for children have a deep understanding of the connections between play, learning, healthy
living and capability expansion. In this course, we critically evaluate research on play and try
to better understand the role of play in our lives and in the lives of children. We investigate
how society and culture shape the ways we think about play and how much access to play
we have in our daily lives. We talk about play experiences for children on the Autism
spectrum as well as for children who have experienced trauma. We address whether video
games count as play and how to support principles of play in an increasingly digital world.
There are two goals for this course. The first goal is to help each student value play for
children and for themselves and to have a range of theory and evidence to advocate for play.
The second goal is for students to expand their capabilities to support children’s play in ways
that increase their agency rather than try simply to control them.
This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are designed
to engage you in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing you with the
opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related to your
major. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from the
independent investigation and presentation of your own work.

Required Text
Course Reading Packet - ALD 321 can be purchased on first day of classes (Tuesday) or at
Asel Art Supply 510 W. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.
Technology Etiquette
I expect that you will use your laptop/tablet/phone in appropriate ways and at appropriate
times. There are so many ways you *could* distract yourself in class – please don’t. Stay with
us. Posting on social media any pictures or quotes from students or teachers is prohibited.
Class should be a safe place for sharing ideas without worrying about people posting it. If
you are on social media or email instead of engaging in class, you will lose participation
points.
Course Assignments
I. Participation (60 points)
Participation includes coming prepared to class, reading the assignments, appropriately
participating in class discussions and periodic attendance assignments. Regular attendance
at all class meetings is a requirement of this course: you cannot learn if you are not here. For
each class session you miss, 3-5 points will be deducted from your final grade for the course.
In addition to attendance, your class engagement will be evaluated as well based on your
participation during Tuesday’s lectures and small sections. Each of you will be granted two
Emergency Release (ER) days. Your ER excuses you from two class sessions with no penalty.
To use your ER you must notify me and your TA by email BEFORE class. (If you fail to contact
me before class, you ER will not count, and you will lose points.) Save your two ER’s for
medical issues, family demands, car trouble, etc. All other absences are unexcused and will
affect your grade. *Students will not be penalized for absences due to the observance of
religious holidays that fall on our scheduled class day. You must give me an advance notice
of these absences, so I can make the necessary accommodations. All other absences are
unexcused and will affect your grade.
For both Tuesday’s lectures and the small sections, sign-in sheets would be made available
for the first 10 minutes of class for you to mark attendance. If you are late and unable to sign,
then please check in with your TA after the class for attendance.
II. Daily Reflection (65 points total)
Before each Tuesday class you will post a reflection of the reading by 11 am on Canvas under
the Discussion tab (except for Week 1 and 15). To post, students will reply to the discussion
board created each week. Once your response is posted you will be able to see your other
classmates’ responses as well. You are free to discuss and respond to one another, but that
is not a requirement. However, glancing over each other’s work may enhance the
conversation within class. Please see below for a few reflection guidelines:
                                                                                               2


1. Your post should be approximately 250 words (excluding your 2-3 questions- see below).
2. Your writing should synthesize all the readings, not summarize.
3. Your reflection may include a few, some, or all of the following:
     • What was most compelling and striking to you in the readings? What makes you think
         more deeply in the reading in helpful and provocative ways?
     • What are the major arguments/thesis of each reading (what supporting evidence,
         facts, experiences, or data do the authors provide to support their arguments)? And,
         what are your reactions to the arguments? Are you convinced, why or why not?
     • What are specific strengths and weaknesses of the promulgated ideas? How did the
         authors support or not support their argument? Were there any perspectives missing
         in the reading?
     • How do the authors' perspectives compare and contrast across readings?
     • How does the reading content relate to your own life experience and your research
         in education? Critically reflect on this question.
Finally, ALWAYS create 2-3 robust questions from the readings that may be used for
discussion. Have a mix of larger questions that relate to the theme of the course, but also
specific questions that relate directly to what you read for that week. Include page numbers
and direct quotes where appropriate. These questions will guide discussions during small
group meetings on Thursdays.
III. Opening Activity (10 points)
For each small section meeting on Thursday, students will prepare one 10-minute opening
activity that relates to the topic we will be discussing. The activity can be and is not limited
to a game, video clip, discussion questions, etc. Be creative! Students will sign-up for a
session on the first day of class. On your opening activity week, you need to send your TA a
paragraph about what you are going to do for opening activity and how it is connected to
that week’s readings by Tuesday.
III. Play Series
1. Generation Play (Data due 02/07/19 and Reflection due 02/14/19 ) (25 points)
For this project, you will be asked to complete an interview with one adult about his/ her
play memories (using guiding questions that we come up with in class) and one interview
with a child (ages 3-12) about his/her experiences and ideas about play. Students will bring
data to class and the following week turn in a 1-2 page (typed, double spaced) reflection that
draws upon readings and interview data.
2. Observation of Play (Paper due 03/07/19) (25 points)
                                                                                               3


Students will observe children (0-12 year-old) playing in a public space such as a park,
museum or school for one hour and then analyze their observations using at least one
theorist and/or reading from class in a 3-4 page (typed, double spaced) paper. You are also
encouraged to use your experiences from the interviews and connect it to your observations
in the paper. Possible areas of focus include the ways children engage in play, welcome or
don’t welcome others into their play, how physical materials and nature play a role in the
play, how adults interact with children during play, ways that certain things encourage and
discourage play and how regulations impact play.
*Be sure to be respectful of children. You do NOT have permission to film or take
photographs – only observations from a distance.
3. Environment Design for Play (Due 04/04/19) (25 points)
Due: Environment redesign map
Students will take a picture of an inside space (classroom, family room, hospital, library,
outdoor space, supermarket, museum, hallway) and change the design to allow for play –
this includes attention to time and space as well as what people do, what is around for them
and how it is regulated. Students can map, draw arrows, stick pictures, create models or
narratively explain the readings/ concepts/ theorists/ researchers that inspire each change.
4. Equity and Development (Due 04/25/19) (25 points)
Write a paper or create some type of a visual demonstration (e.g., poster, ppt presentation,
or video of yourself) to explain how play and development is impacted by equity issues. The
equity issues include, but are not limited to, race, class, ability, gender, sexuality, language or
immigration status. Select one of these equity issues and provide three related examples to
articulate how play is affected by that particular equity issue. You can draw examples from
legitimate news sources, articles, reports, or books (NOT from the reading packet). You may
use the readings to support the examples you have found from the other sources. One
example can be your own experience You can also write about your own experience(s) as a
child, aunt/uncle, or parent and reflect on how (in)equity issues played a part in your or the
child’s/children’s play and development Please cite your sources according to APA style.
IV. Play Advocacy Project (Final) (Presentation due 05/09/19, Paper due 05/13/19) (70
points)
Due: Play advocacy artifact Cover sheet (found on Canvas)
      Reflection paper (2-3 pages, double-spaced)
      Proof of Project’s execution (i.e. screenshot, forwarded email, etc)
This project is meant to demonstrate knowledge of the importance of play and a committed
effort to advocating on behalf of young children. Using discussions and readings from the
class as a guide, students will create an advocacy piece that is meant to publicly explain the
importance of play. This is meant to be a flexible but high quality creative project. For
example, students could write a general op-ed for the Texas Tribune on the importance of
                                                                                                  4


play. Students could choose to advocate for play in certain specific environments such a
schools, doctors’ offices or other locations. Students could choose a particular group of
people/organization to focus on with their project. Other possible project options include
policy brief, podcast, graphics poster, graphic novel, social media campaign. Students will be
graded according to the play advocacy project guidelines/ cover sheet found on canvas.

Class Policies and Grading Criteria
    •  All papers, assignments, and projects must be completed and submitted through
       canvas by the start of the class session on which they are due. The grade on any late
       work will be decreased by 5 points for each day beyond the due date unless

       an A. Please refer to the University of Texas at Austin's grading system that defines
       the following letter grades: A (excellent); B (above average); C (average); D (pass); F
       (failure). In this class A= 93-100; A- =90-92; B+=87-89; B=83-86; B- =80-82; C+=77-
