Course Description
                         This course examines one of the most radical moments in civil rights
                         history—the 1964 Mississippi Project. Widely known as “Freedom
                         Summer,” this civil rights campaign organized a multi-faceted program
                         that challenged white supremacy and racial terror through the
                         establishment of Freedom Schools, voter registration drives, and an
                         alternative political party called the Mississippi Freedom Democratic
                         Party. Even more, Freedom Summer called on Black youth, women and
                         men from the community, many of whom were poor and uneducated, to
                         lead their own movement.
It was during the Freedom Summer campaign that activists considered the merits of non-violence
vs. self-defense; the limits of charismatic male leadership; the role of white allies in the struggle
for Black freedom; and the meaning of solidarity. In the face of extraordinary violence and
economic deprivation, Black Mississippians waged one of the most powerful, yet understudied,
movements in civil rights history, and they modeled the maxim that “ordinary people can
accomplish extraordinary things.”
Using primary sources, film, music, and scholarly texts, students will explore the 1964 Freedom
Summer Project in order to understand diverse struggles, leadership styles, and competing
interpretations of what it means to be free. Borrowing directly from the original Freedom School
curriculum, students will contemplate the “myths of society” as well as theoretical and
conceptual frameworks necessary for the creation of a just society. Students will situate Freedom
Summer in the larger context of the Black Freedom Movement in the United States, the Cold
War, independence and human rights struggles.
                                                                                                      1

Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
      “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core
      values of the University and uphold academic integrity.”
This means that work you produce on assignments, tests and exams is all your own work, unless it is
assigned as group work.
Always cite your sources. If you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have
used in previous class), you must make that clear otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and
subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course.
You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Integrity Policy which can be found at
the following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php
