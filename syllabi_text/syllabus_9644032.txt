COURSE DESCRIPTION
UNIVERSITY CATALOG C OURSE DESCRIPTION
Further exploration of biomedical engineering design principles through open-ended hands-on applications.
                        How do engineers actually design devices?
This course will challenge students to engage in many aspects of the engineering design process. Students will
learn the basics of engineering design in both lab and lecture by participating in a semester long design project.
The goal of the course is to provide students for opportunity for professional growth by exposing them to an
extended engineering design process while giving opportunities for strengthening teamwork, creativity, and
practical communication skills.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of the semester, students will have the opportunity to:
     • Design and build a working biomedical engineering device prototype
     • Consider the impacts of market, budget, and the FDA on device requirements and design
     • Participate in an engineering design process including reviews and documentation
     • Follow the medical device design control process outlined by the FDA and ISO
     • Learn about companies and recent events in the biomedical device industry
     • Assess and improve team function

ABET PROGRAM OUTCOME S
(2) an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of
public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors
(4) an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed
judgements, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and
societal contexts
(5) an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative
and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives
(7) an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies
COURSE REQUIREMENTS
REQUIRED MATERIALS
There is no required textbook. All required content will be posted on the Canvas webpage. You will also be
responsible for doing your own research to find content applicable to your design project.
You must keep a lab/design notebook. For this class you will have the option of keeping a physical lab/design
notebook or an electronic lab/design notebook.
          Physical notebook must meet the following criteria:
               1) Permanently bound pages
               2) Pages pre-numbered, without any missing numbers or pages torn out
               3) Room for table of contents at the beginning
          You can buy acceptable lab/design notebooks from either BMES or from the Co-op.
          Electronic notebook must be Microsoft OneNote.
          OneNote can be downloaded free for almost every platform.
          The lab/design notebook must be a separate OneNote notebook from class notes, personal notes, etc.
          Guidelines for maintaining both physical and electronic lab/design notebooks are posted on Canvas.
          Lab/design notebooks will be graded in lab throughout the semester.
PREREQUISITES
BME 245L and BME 343.


COURSE FORMAT AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES
The course will consist of lectures on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays from 9-11am and a 3-hour lab section
on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays from 12-3pm. All lectures will be held in GDC 1.406 and all labs will be
held in BME 3.310.
Lectures will contain some background information, and will help students understand the design process.
However, much of the learning in this course will be self-directed. Student’s will use the knowledge and
resources from lecture and will be responsible for learning the specifics that are needed to complete the semester
long design project.
Labs will be time to work with your team and ask TA and LA questions, but teams are given freedom to work on
their projects on a convenient schedule. Every student will be required to check in for every lab period so that TAs
can ensure progress is being made and give feedback. While every student will have the opportunity to learn the
specifics of the engineering design process, not every student will learn the same material in this class because of
the collaborative nature of the design project.
Lecture materials, lab assignments, and examples may be found on Canvas https://canvas.utexas.edu/.
HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS COURSE
Participation: This is a hands-on course. You will learn the most by participating the design process with your
team. Participation includes showing up on time to both lab and scheduled lectures. Lab session attendance is
mandatory.
Project management: In order to complete the design project successfully, you will have to manage the project
well. You will have to work steadily throughout the semester and use all of the available resources (including all of
your teammates)
Explore: One major goal of college is to teach you how to find answers yourself. Research has shown that you will
learn more by actively participating in learning rather than being spoon fed information from an instructor. The
design project in this class is open ended, which means you have a lot of freedom to explore. Learn something new
by trying something new!
Teamwork: All of your work in the class will be accomplished in teams of 4-5. Teams are randomly assigned and
you will have to work well with your teams in order to be successful. There is no formal peer-feedback for this
class. [Translated: there is not a mechanism where you can write an angry letter to the instructor complaining
about your teammates]. Depending on the random team assignments, you might be given the opportunity to
learn to work with people who may be quite different in their approach and goals than you are.
Practice safety and cleanliness: Successfully working in the lab requires adherence to all safety guidelines. You
must dress appropriately for a laboratory environment (socks and closed toed shoes are required), follow all safety
procedures, and wear PPE (googles) when appropriate. You must also maintain the lab room as if you were
working in a professional setting and part of your grade will be based on your ability to clean up after yourself and
respect the shared equipment available to you. Because this is the summer session, you may store parts of your
project in the junior lab room, provided they are packed up and stored neatly in a way that does not interfere with
working space for other teams.

COURSE POLICIES
CLASS PARTICIPATION AND ATTENDANCE
Lecture and lab attendance is mandatory. Students are expected to attend all lectures and show up to at least the
beginning of all lab sessions. All absences must be discussed with the Instructor prior to the session or as soon as
possible in case of an emergency. Because of the open-ended nature of the project and the various resources that
are not located in BME 3.310, students are not required to stay for the entire lab section, but all teams are
expected to meet all deadlines for the class.
LAB CLEANLINESS
Before leaving lab, you must clean up after yourself. If the TA or instructor has to clean up after you, you will lose
points on your lab work grade. If the lab space is not cared for, specific sections or the entire class may lose points.
GRADING POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Lab assignments must be submitted electronically on Canvas before the beginning of your lab session on the due
date. Lecture assignments are due before the beginning of lecture on the due date. Due dates will be made clear
when assignments are given. Any late submission will be penalized 5 points before close of business (5:00 p.m.)
and 10 points per day after that. A student (and an assignment) will be considered “late” 20 minutes after the start
of the lab session.
REGRADE REQUESTS
Grading questions and clarifications should be discussed with the grader (either TA or instructor). If you believe
the TA unfairly graded an assignment, you must submit, in writing, a re-grade request to the instructor within 3
days of the assignment being returned. The instructor will re-grade the ENTIRE assignment from scratch, without
referencing the original grading.
LATE ASSIGNMENTS
Because all assignments will be accomplished as a group, no late assignments are accepted without penalty.
Groups will have to work together to make sure all assignments are submitted on time. Assignments will be posted
via Canvas unless otherwise specified. If there are extenuating circumstances, they will be handled on a case by
case basis. Communicate with the instructor as far in advance as possible.


GRADING
The breakdown of your final grade is as follows
                     Assignment                          Points possible          Percent of total grade

Grades will be assigned as follows. If you are within 3 points / 0.3% of the next cutoff, consideration will be given
for participation and effort to bump your grade up to the next level. I will not bump grades up automatically; you
must ask and give me the rationale why I should round your grade up.

  F               0%             0


Some assignments will be graded on a rubric that corresponds to the total number of points shown in the above
grade breakdown table. These assignments are: my learning objectives, reflection essay, and lab work grade.
For the rest of the assignments, a 0-5 scale will be used for each rubric item. This scale is meant to correlate
stronger to industry norms used for annual performance evaluations.
Grading scale for each rubric item:
    • 0: incomplete / not done
    • 1: needs significant improvement
    • 2: does not meet expectations
    • 3: meets expectations
    • 4: exceeds expectations
    • 5: outstanding
The score for most rubric items should be 3 = meets expectations. If you meet all expectations in this course, you
will receive an A. However 3/5 = 60%, so in order to assign the correct number of points that corresponds to an A,
the percentage grade you receive on the 0-5 rubric will be mapped to the a percentage grade for the assignment
using linear interpolation as show in the chart below:
                                                  100
                                                   90
                         Grade on A-F scale (%)
                                                   80
                                                   70
                                                   60
                                                   50
                                                   40
                                                   30
                                                   20
                                                   10
                                                    0
                                                        0          20      40       60       80      100
                                                            Score on 0-5 'meets requirements' scale (%)
The specific mathematical mapping is as follows:
  x = percentage score     y = percentage score
    on 0-5 rubric scale         on A-F scale
                    x > 60 y = 0.15x + 85
              20 < x < 60 y = 0.7x + 52
                    X < 20 y = 0.303x
Example: if your team scores all 3/5 ratings on the customer needs assignment rubric items and therefore receives
a score 24/40 = 60%, your grade that will go in the gradebook is (0.15)(60)+85 = 94% = 37.6 points.
However, if you did not meet expectations for a couple of items and received a 22/40 = 55%, then the grade that
will go in the gradebook is (0.7)(55)+52 = 90.5% = 36.2 points.
Conversely, if there were a couple of items that you exceeded expectations on and received a 26/40 = 65%, then
the grade that will go in the gradebook is (0.15)(65)+85 = 94.75% = 37.9 points.

DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH ACADEMIC INTEGRITY. IF YOU ARE UNSURE OR CONFUSED, ASK FOR
HELP. IT IS EACH STUDENT’S RESPONSIBILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSITY’S POLICIES ON
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY. IF YOU TURN IN AN ASSIGNMENT THAT HAS ACADEMIC INTEGRITY ISSUES, “I
DIDN’T KNOW” IS NOT AN EXCUSE.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INF ORMATION
If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs or Professors, call BCAL (the Behavior
Concerns Advice Line): 512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous. If something doesn’t feel right – it probably
isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security,
512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when an
alarm or alert is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside, unless told
otherwise by an official representative.
     •    Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that
          the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
     •    Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of
          class.
     •    In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a
          building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at
          Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
