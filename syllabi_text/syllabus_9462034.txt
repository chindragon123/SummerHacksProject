Course Description
As the capstone courses in the advertising program, this class integrates all of the course work
within both the major and outside areas. This is the course in which students learn the most and
have the most fun working in agency teams on a real project.
In order to provide students with an appreciation of what should be included in an integrated
brand promotion (IBP) campaign plan, a major campaign development project and a series of
individual task and group projects are used during the semester. The major focus of the course is
on the development of an IBP campaign plan for a client; students will work on a range of
projects as members of agency account teams. The class does not center on the development of
new skills; rather, it is about the refinement and integration of what you have already learned.
In addition to an emphasis on developing and presenting a complete campaign, the course is
given direction and supplemented through the use of lectures, handouts, video presentations, and
recommended readings.
Course Objectives
The objective of the course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of the process
of planning, presenting, and implementing complete IBP campaigns. In order to accomplish this
objective, the emphasis in the course is on each individual learning-by-doing—that is, by
developing and presenting a complete campaign for a real client.
Secondary objectives of the course are to increase each student’s level of competence,
professionalism, and ethical thinking. Specifically, the course is designed to help students
sharpen the following skills: strategic and critical thinking; planning; organizational; written and
                                                   1


verbal communication; time management; interpersonal; and group work (bringing out the best
in others).
Required Course Materials
Berger, J. (2016). Contagious: Why things catch on. Simon and Schuster.
Jugenheimer, D. W., Sheehan, K., & Kelley, L. D. (2015). Advertising media planning: A brand
management approach. Routledge (e-book available on the UT library website).
*Other supplementary readings and video lectures will be available on CANVAS.
Instructional Approach
To achieve the course objectives, I will provide:
(a) supplemental readings and examples to provide a common framework to structure
understanding of the strategic IBP planning process;
(b) guidance for a major account team campaign development project—as well as several
smaller ones—to mirror the work environment on both the client and agency sides of the
advertising and communications business; and
(c) writing assignments and other projects to help focus on key components of the strategic
planning process and personal development.
Course Requirements
                                 Main-client Presentation (15%)
Main-client presentations should be 12 minutes long in total. The audience will be your client,
me, and your peers who intend to offer helpful feedback. This will consist entirely of group-
based work, from initial research to design, deliverables, measurement, testing, etc. Your focus
should be on carrying out campaign planning from beginning to end. In order to be an effective
pitch, every element should support your main ideas and recommendations.
An essential part of any career is the ability to present ideas in a clear and engaging manner.
While the ideas themselves of course have great value, it would be difficult to overstate the
importance of how you present those ideas. Presentation grades will reflect the fact that it is not
simply about how good your ideas may be but how effectively you present them.
                                         Plansbook (30%)
A sample outline of a plansbook will be released. You will follow the outline provided, except
when revisions are necessary. For everyone, the plansbook is due by Apr 29. You will need to
submit a good hard copy and a pdf file to me. The hard copy will be given to your client on the
final presentation day.
The advertising business is characterized by attention to details and deadlines. All written work
must be prepared using a personal computer and high quality printer. Late work is not accepted.
Demonstrating creativity, enthusiasm and hard work should be each student’s objective during
this course and beyond.
                                                   2


                            (Other) Group Assignments (25% in total)
During the first half of the semester, your group will practice your research and creative skills by
choosing one successful advertising/marketing campaign released in the 21st century, analyzing
and reconstructing it in a reverse way - you will create a proposal pitch using the idea as if it had
not been executed yet. In order to prepare this, your group will (a) identify one successful
campaign and explain your rationale (choosing a campaign, 5%), (b) perform a situation analysis
that likely led to their campaign idea (case study situation analysis, 7%), (c) analyze a target
market (case study target market, 5%) and pitch the main idea of the campaign (pitch the insight,
8%) in front of the class.
                                   Individual Assignments (15%)
Individual assignments are designed to prepare you to go into an interview with a strong
philosophy of how to complete your job. The first assignment requires you to interview a leader
of any small/local/larger business, organization, community, etc., and interview him/her on why
they do what they do. A Ted talk by Simon Sinek will provide you more information on this
question. The second assignment requires you to write an essay on (a) your personal approach to
your communications career, and (b) why it is the right approach for you. More details about the
assignment will be provided in class.
                                          Attendance (5%)
Attendance will be taken as frequently as possible. For the third to fifth absences, your final
grade will be dropped a letter grade. For instance, if you missed three classes and had earned
a B grade, you will receive a C grade for the course. The 6th absence constitutes F for the
course.
I expect you to arrive in class on time and to stay for the entire class. Frequent unexcused,
tardy arrivals will be considered as absence. A random exit may be considered an unexcused
absence.
In extremely rare circumstances, students may be unable to attend class due to serious illness or
crises. These situations will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. In general, notice must be
given to me at least 24 hours before the absence occurs. Excused absences may be due to a
work conflict (confirmation should be presented in advance), illness (a doctor’s excuse should be
provided at the first opportunity) or legitimate emergency situation. You are responsible for
any assignments given and all work missed when absent or late.
                                      Class Participation (5%)
Your active presence in class is vital to meeting the course requirements. Students are expected
to actively participate in class discussion.
Laptop use in lecture is strongly discouraged. Using your laptop or tablet to take notes often
leads to checking email and social media or browsing the internet. This hinders your learning and
has also been shown to distract those around you (https://www.brookings.edu/research/for-
better-learning-in-college-lectures-lay-down-the-laptop-and-pick-up-a-pen/). If a student is
found engaged in any of these distracting activities, s/he will get zero attendance score for
the class. Phones must be in silent mode and all technology (except for taking notes or
performing in-class or group activity on your laptop) must be put away during the class.
                                                  3


                                       Peer Evaluation (5%)
Experiencing the rewards and learning to cope with the problems of working in a small group is
an important part of the class. Advertising is an all-weather, team sport – thus, your group members
will evaluate you as a team member at the end of the semester through a confidential survey.
Late Work Policy
No late work will be accepted for any group work. For individual assignments, I may accept
late work, but you will automatically lose 50% of your score. Software, network or storage
device failure is not a valid excuse for late work. No assignment will be accepted two weeks past
the due date.

Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/index.php)
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning
process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and
submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and
must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and
readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Plagiarism
Part of maintaining academic honesty includes avoiding plagiarism. In your work for this class
and all others, you must cite sources if you use words or ideas that are not your own. This
obviously includes quoted material, but it also covers works that may have inspired your
thinking or ideas you build upon. All your works may go through Turnitin software
(https://www.turnitin.com) that automatically detects plagiarism.
Policy on Religious Holy Days Observance
(http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi03-04/ch4/ch4g.html#attendance)
                                                    6


The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student
from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of
a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under
this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an
examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable
time after the absence.
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence
as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable
time after the absence.
Students with Disabilities (http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd)
Please notify your instructor of any modification/adaptation you may require to accommodate a
disability-related need. You will be requested to provide documentation to the Dean of Student's
Office in order that the most appropriate accommodations can be determined. Specialized
