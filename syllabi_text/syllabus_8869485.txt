Abstract
       An introduction to building interactive and visually appealing 3D levels in a game engine. This
       will include ideation and concept design, whiteboxing, integrating art and sound assets,
       scripting interactions, and adding animations and particle effects, as well as playtesting and
       iterating based on user feedback.
Assessment
       All homework assignments and in-class activities are equally weighted toward 50% of the final
       class grade and are pass/fail. Two larger projects will be worth 25% each, one due at midterms
       and one due at the end of the semester, and will be graded based on the provided rubric.
       Assignments are due by the start of class on the due date.
       No late work will be accepted. No incompletes will be given. If you feel you will not be able to
       complete all work on time, you should ask the instructor for a grade of Q or drop before the
       deadline for doing so passes.
       Note: If you cannot attend class for any reason, please send an email and attach any
       class work as needed, and talk to your classmates to find out what you missed.
