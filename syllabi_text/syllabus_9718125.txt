Course Description and objectives: From the middle 18th century through the late 19th century the Great
Plains region underwent drastic changes in terms of the environment, demography, and cultural diversity.
The rapid influx of various groups of people into the Plains, from Native American groups to European
settlers, made the Plains the ultimate theater to rehearse short-term strategies and long-term policies. This
course will survey the ethnohistory of some of the most influential Native groups on the Plains, from the
arrival of the Spanish through the reservation period. We will explore the relationships and interaction
between European settlers and Native groups, as well as the outcome of some scientific expeditions and
military campaigns. In this course, we will adopt a long-term perspective to make sense of the
development of European policies and movements, the changing configurations among Native groups,
and the pivotal importance of resources such as the buffalo, the horse, and the gun. We will also look at
specific events and historical figures, such as Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and General Custer, whose
actions became symbolic of a turbulent historical period.
FLAGS:
This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. The purpose of the Cultural
Diversity in the United States Flag is for students to explore in depth the shared practices and beliefs of
one or more underrepresented cultural groups subject to persistent marginalization. In addition to learning
about these diverse groups in relation to their specific contexts, students should engage in an active
process of critical reflection. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come
from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one underrepresented cultural
group in the U.S.
This course also carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience
with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester,
complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your
writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to
read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to
come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical
                                                                                                            1


Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher
Education Coordinating Board.
Coursework/Grading:
Map test: 10 points. Students are allowed one re-take of the map test and choose the highest grade.
Students must pass the map test.
Book Report: The Book Report assignment is meant to evaluate each student’s reading, comprehension
and writing capabilities. To achieve these objectives this assignment will be composed of two steps:
                  q   Statement of Interest: students will prepare a ½ page description (typed, double-
                       spaced) of the issue or issues they wish to discuss in the Crazy Horse and Custer
                       Book Report. 5 points.
                  q   Book Report (typed, double-spaced and 3 to 5 pages in length): 15 points.
Text-Image Group Project: (typed, double-spaced, 5 to 10 pages in length): 20 points
                 q   The Text-Image Project is a group project. The maximum grade for the group is 15
                       points for each member of the group. The remainder five points is the maximum
                       grade given to each student for their individual specific contribution to the overall
                       project.
Term Research Paper: The Term Research Paper is meant to evaluate each student’s capabilities to
choose and research a topic, organize that research, and present a well-written, cogent argument about
that topic. Students will be given a range of topics based on the readings and class discussions. Like the
Book Report, the Research Paper will be composed of two steps:
                 q    Research Paper Proposal: one page (typed, double-spaced): 5 points.
                  Students will present a proposal of the topic they chose to research. This proposal has to
                 indicate how the student intends to address and develop the topic chosen and should
                 include at least two of the sources to be used in the paper. Term Research Paper: (typed,
                 double-spaced and 10 pages in length): 25 points.
                           Ø   In the Term Research Paper students also must use at least three (3) sources
                                from the books and readings assigned, and demonstrate individual research
                                by using two (2) other sources procured by the student.
                           Ø   Written assignments will be graded on grammar, punctuation, style,
                                comprehension and content. In these assignments, students are expected to
                                demonstrate their ability to read, understand, synthesize, and critique the
                                materials read.
                           Ø   All sources used in the written assignments have to be specifically and
                                completely referenced in MLA or Chicago Manual of Style.
                                Students are strongly encouraged to visit the Writing Center
