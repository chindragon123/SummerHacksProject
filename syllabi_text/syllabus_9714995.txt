This graduate seminar surveys key texts in the history of U.S. capitalism, paying particular attention to how capitalism
has shaped American culture, and how American culture has shaped capitalism. We will place scholarship from the
“new history of capitalism” into conversation with older texts to ask a series of questions: What is capitalism? What is
culture? How does the “new history of capitalism” stem from and diverge from older scholarship on labor, business, and
consumption? What is the relationship between the history of capitalism and American Studies? Our analysis will
foreground scholars interrogating racial capitalism, empire, gender, and sexuality, and we will also examine debates in
the field about whether the “new history of capitalism” is or is not antagonistic to the so-called “cultural turn.”
