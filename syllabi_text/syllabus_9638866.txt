Course Description:
"Everyone who makes films has to be an athlete to a certain degree because cinema does not come from abstract
academic thinking; it comes from your knees and thighs. Film is not analysis, it is the agitation of mind; cinema
comes from the country fair and the circus, not from art and academicism."
--Werner Herzog
This course is designed to introduce fundamental production concepts and techniques through lectures, projects,
and lab experiences. The acquisition of technical skills will be a priority, as this course is a prerequisite to upper
division production classes, but emphasis will also be placed on developing your own voice as a storyteller and
the ability to create works characterized by simple yet effective visual, aural and narrative structures.
Additionally, I would like you to focus on stories based on PERSONAL experience that is significant and
meaningful to you. Your experience is one thing that separates you from all others.
*Special note on the summer session: This will be an intense & action-packed semester to say the least. Expect to
work hard, read hard, and have fun. You will be completing big projects almost weekly. But you will also get a lot
of great hands-on experience, in small lab sections!
General sequence of topics:
        -- the still image/composition/visual components/visual structure            -- lighting
        -- the moving image/screen grammar/the shot                                   -- editing
        -- the digital video camera                                            -- sound design
        -- audio fundamentals                                -- introduction to documentary
        -- sound recording                                               -- future & film work
Suggested Texts (available at Co-op, Amazon.com, as well as UT Library electronically):
Voice and Vision: A Creative Approach to Narrative Film and DV Production
by Mick Hurbis-Cherrier (3rd edition)
Other required readings will be posted in the Course Documents section of the Canvas course site.
Course Requirements:
    • Complete the two required projects: 1) a still photography project, 2) a digital video project. These
        assignments will be posted in detail on Canvas and will be reviewed in class.
    • Attend and participate fully in all classes and labs.
    • Arrive on time at all classes and labs and keep up with all assignments.


    •   Keep a handwritten journal of your ideas, thoughts and observations this semester. Doodle, draw,
        document, storyboard, plan, vent, conceptualize, comment, etc. Legible? Yes. Neat and tidy? Not
        necessarily.
Supplies:
You can anticipate the following expenses to complete the assigned projects this semester:
        35mm b/w film + processing
        Mac formatted hard drive / USB 3.0 recommended
You will be able to use your drive in many other film classes here at UT; it’s a worthwhile investment.
Labs:
Labs meet each afternoon (M/T/W) at 1:30p. Lab attendance will be taken each day and is the largest portion
of your final grade. If you arrive five minutes late you will be marked Late. If you are ten minutes
late (or more) you will be marked Absent.
Pop Quizzes:
There will be several unannounced, short quizzes at various times throughout the semester. Questions will be
taken from readings, lectures and screenings. These “pop quizzes” will be worth 10% of your final grade.
Final Exam:
There will be a final exam during class time on Tuesday, July 9 unless otherwise announced. Exam questions
will be taken from readings, lectures, lab work and screenings. Concepts and technical information from the
readings will not always be covered in lectures or labs, but that does not mean that such material will not be
tested on the final exam.
**NOTE** There will be absolutely no makeups for the final exam, or for missed quizzes.
If you have a medical emergency, bring a doctor’s note and talk with the professor.
Key Class Dates:
                June 21 (Project 1 due at noon)                July 8 (Project 2 due at start of lab)
                July 9 (Final Exam)                            July 10 (Class Screening)

                     B+ 87-89                           D+       67-69
                     B 83-86                            D        63-66
                     B- 80-82                           D-       60-62
                     C+ 77-79                           F        below 60
Your score for a given assignment will be lowered by 5 points for every day the assignment is turned in late,
including weekends. Assignments will be graded over a 1-2 week period and returned to you.
A grade of B- or better is a prerequisite for all upper division production courses.
General Grading Criteria:
The following are general guidelines for grades. These are meant only as general statements and not intended
to be directly applicable for grading projects.
A-level work is strong conceptually, aesthetically, creatively, and technically. It adheres to guidelines and
communicates strongly and clearly through the medium. The concept of the work is original and innovative and
the technical execution of the idea is superior. A-level work takes creative and conceptual risks while
maintaining coherence about the statement it is making.
B-level work achieves success in some areas but not all: originality, concept, aesthetics, creativity, and technical
execution. For example, sometimes it is technically strong but conceptually weak; other times it is highly original
but not technically competent. Sometimes the work is creatively strong but has trouble holding together as a
coherent piece with a particular message.
C-level work typically may have small amounts of success in technical, creative, conceptual, and aesthetic areas,
but has difficulty in multiple areas.
D-level work and below fails to achieve success and competence in most areas. It is typically conceptually weak,
fails to deliver an original or coherent idea, has major technical difficulties, and takes little or no creative risk.
Final Note: Success
The SINGLE best way to do well (B level or higher) in this class is to have stellar attendance & participation in
labs & lecture, and to apply yourself on projects. (It’s not a bad strategy in other areas of life either.)

UNIVERSITY RULE
Filming on UT’s campus is permitted, but showing recognizable UT locations (tower, stadium, logos) is not.
This could affect your grade on projects, and also create some challenges with UT & RTF administration, so it’s
best to avoid it altogether. Plus, it’s usually not very creative!
UNIVERSITY ELECTRONIC MAIL NOTIFICATION POLICY
All students should become familiar with the University’s official e-mail student notification policy. It is the
student’s responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or her e-mail address. Students are
expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related
communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e- mail
be checked daily. The complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your e-mail address are
available at
http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy#one
In this course e-mail will be used as a means of communication with students. You will be responsible for
checking your e- mail regularly for class work and announcements.
UNIVERSITY POLICY RE: SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, falsifying
academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic
dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading information to receive a
postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same
written assignment for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. Additionally,
scholastic dishonesty includes signing the attendance sheet on behalf of someone else or having someone
else sign you in when you are not in attendance.
By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonest
damages both the student's learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students
who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. For more information on scholastic
dishonesty, please visit the Student Judicial services Web site at
http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/
THE UNDERGRADUATE WRITING CENTER
The Undergraduate Writing Center, located in the FAC 211, phone 471-6222, offers individualized assistance to

RTF SAFETY POLICY
Special safety precautions for your crew, actors and others in the area are required if you are undertaking any
hazardous activities while filming, including but not limited to ANY driving or horseback/livestock shots,
shooting in or around water or heights, or if you are using stunts, flames, pyrotechnics, squibs or simulated
weapons. Please note that unlicensed handguns and other real weapons are never permitted in RTF studios or
on location shoots. In addition, you must follow all federal, state and local laws and the rules of any venue or
location at which you are filming regarding hazardous activities, including University of Texas at Austin rules if
filming is done on campus.
Student filmmakers must submit a detailed safety plan to their course instructor and the RTF Technical Facilities
Manager if a script or project involves driving or horseback/livestock shots, shooting in or around water or
heights, stunts, flames, pyrotechnics, squibs, weapons or any other hazardous activities (this requirement applies
to all shoots, including documentary projects, but please see the special guidelines for documentary driving
shots below). It is the responsibility of the student to hire experts in the field and budget at least $600/day for
expert consultation and on-set supervision if, in the judgment of the class instructor and the Technical Facilities
Manager, such expert consultation or supervision is necessary. In addition, any utilization of pyrotechnics on
the University of Texas at Austin campus requires prior review and approval through the Fire Prevention
Services office by the University Fire Marshal or their designee.
Students should understand that driving while filming will be permitted only in strictly limited circumstances,
such as on a private road or drive. In most circumstances, students who wish to undertake driving shots will be
required to arrange for a police escort and a city permit. Monitors inside the vehicle will NOT be allowed while
filming in a vehicle. Filming from the back of trucks is not considered safe and is not permitted under any
circumstances.
Documentary filming of an interview while the interview subject is driving is only permitted if the
cameraperson is secured in a seat belt and is not directing the driver of the car in any way, besides engaging in a
conversation in which the driver/interviewee has been informed not to look at the camera or the interviewer at
all during the interview. In addition, any filming from a vehicle, for drive-by B-roll, must be done by a
cameraperson secured in a seat belt, where the driver is not being directed in any way by the director, so that
they are driving as they normally would. As noted above, any documentary student planning on filming in any
vehicle must submit a safety plan to their course instructor and the RTF Technical Facilities Manager.
Students who fail to comply with this policy will receive a failing grade in this class and will be barred from
future access to RTF production and post-production equipment and facilities.
