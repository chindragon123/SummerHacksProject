Textbook: Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences by Gravetter and Wallnau (ninth edition). The textbook will be
available at the Co-op.
Canvas http://courses.utexas.edu Announcements, course handouts, some lecture notes, exam materials, and grades
will be posted on the course Canvas site. If you have a question about the course, please check Canvas and the
syllabus. Please make sure to allow/initiate Canvas emails – I frequently contact the entire class this way with
materials or updates.
Course Description: This course is designed to help you learn the introductory descriptive and inferential statistical
procedures that are commonly used in research. You will learn the assumptions underlying common statistical
procedures, the types of hypotheses that can be tested by these procedures, and the inferences that can be drawn from
their results. After completing this course, you will have a sufficient foundation from which you can begin to conduct
your own analyses and critically evaluate the statistical analyses of others.
    •    What to Bring to Class Everyday: A calculator, a copy of the statistical tables from the appendix in the
         text, and the formula sheet (this can also be found on Canvas).
Classroom Expectations: As lecture is an active learning environment. Learning statistics includes a great deal of
quantitative analysis and hand manipulations of data. Studies indicate that this kind of material is retained better if
people take notes by hand (as opposed to a laptop).
Description of Assignments:
         Graded:
                  Quizzes: There will be one short quiz. You must be present for credit.
                  In-Class Exams: There will be three in-class exams. These will include calculations and some
                  statistical definitions to write. If you are late you will not receive additional time. You will be able to
                  use your (non-graphing) calculator, a formula sheet that will be available all semester on Canvas (I’ll
                  provide clean copies for the exam), and any relevant statistical tables.
         Ungraded:
                  Practice Problems: There will be problems assigned from the book that correspond to the topics we
                  will cover in class. Although these are not graded, they are recommended, and I will be more than
                  happy to discuss these problems with you during office hours.
                  I may assign small non-graded projects for you to complete and bring to class (for example, thinking
                  about how a particular statistical concept applies to your field of study.) I favor a very active learning
                  environment and encourage questions throughout the lecture.


 Attendance: Attendance will not be taken during each class, but it is highly recommended that you attend. There
 may be concepts that are tested which were discussed to a different degree than can be found in the textbook.
     - If you miss a quiz or in-class exam, you will not be able to retake it.
 If you have exceptional circumstances or a serious illness, you must notify me before a quiz or exam is due so that
 we can discuss your options.
 Students with Disabilities: The University of Texas provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations
 for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259,
 471-6441 TTY.
