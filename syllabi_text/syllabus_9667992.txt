Course description:
        This course is designed to help you understand and assess the basic principles of story
structure and storytelling technique in contemporary film, television and digital media. We will
be looking at a wide range of media products, from mainstream American film and television to
various forms of digital, interactive, and ‘new’ media. We also will be looking at “non-fiction”
and “unscripted” media, from documentary films to reality television programs. And we will be
looking at interactive media in which the “user” participates in the creative process. Our
operating assumption as we look at these wide-ranging forms is that they are all narratives of
one kind or another, that they all involve a complex, rule-bound story-telling process. Our
primary goal this semester is to understand precisely what those “rules” are, and how we might
use them to assess other media forms and products, and to create our own work as well.
        Please note that this is a labor-intensive course in terms of daily meeting times when the
lectures and screenings are taken into account. Students will not be excused for work or
vacations. We have a few weeks to cover fifteen weeks of material. Please plan accordingly, and
approach this as a demanding course.
There are three key components to the course:
·    regular Monday-Thursday class lectures
·    weekly Canvas discussion (due on Mondays at 10 am)
·    required screenings on Mondays and Wednesdays
Required Readings: There are reading assignments for each class meeting as well, which are
somewhat heavier early in the term. You will need to keep up with the reading in order to do
well.
Note**: Course packets are available at Jenn’s on 26th & Guadalupe. Any additional readings
will be posted to Canvas. Make sure to bring your course packets to each lecture.
Screenings: Required screenings of films, television programs, and other media content will
provide the basis for all of the lectures and exams, and thus are an essential component of the
course.
Weekly Canvas Discussion: Every Thursday by 7 p.m., I will post on Canvas a question, a
provocation, a clip, archival material, or a feature article related to the topic of the week. You are
required to write 150-200 words (one small paragraph) as a response to the post. You have time
till Monday, 10 am.
Grading


        Please don’t fret about the B-or-better rule (in terms of qualifying for upper-division
production courses). If you do the work, you can reasonably expect to get at least a B in the
course. In other words, you need to:
    • Regularly attend classes and screenings
    • pay attention and take notes
    • keep up with the readings
    • actively participate in class discussion
    • Submit all assignments on time

Important Policies and notes:
Attendance:
        Please note that attendance is tied-in with your participation grade. If you miss class, it
will have a significant effect on your grade. Screenings are a part of your attendance. Instead of
conventional sign-in sheet, we will do a daily multiple-choice quiz which will account for your
attendance for the day. Make sure to come to class on time so you don’t miss the quiz. Each
class meeting—lecture and screening—counts for two points. If you come in after I take
attendance or leave before I dismiss class, you will receive half-credit. Late arrivals should notify
me, so I can make their presence noted. For the screenings, we will have a sign-in and sign-out
sheet and each student must sign the sheet twice to get full 2 points for attendance. One absence
per semester is allowed without paperwork. After that you are required to submit official
paperwork- medical note, for instance, or you lose the attendance points for the day.


Late Assignment Policy
        You lose a point for each day that your assignment is late.
Email Policy
        Give me 24 hours to respond to your email during the weekdays.
Note-taking
I do not post lecture PowerPoints on Canvas. Multiple studies have shown that note-taking
drastically increases our ability to grasp the material. I would be happy to help you fill in the
gaps in your notes during my office hours.
Academic Writing
        Much of the work for the course involves essay writing, whether in exams or in
assignments coming from your discussion groups. If you need work on your writing, I strongly
recommend that you contact the University Writing Center (PCL 2.330, 471-6222,
uwc.utexas.edu). This is an excellent resource. The Writing Center offers free, individualized
help with writing for any UT undergraduate, by appointment or on a drop-in basis.
        Another resource available to you is the Moody College Writing Support Program.
The Moody College Writing Support Program, located in BMC 3.322, offers one-on-one
assistance without charge to students seeking to improve their professional writing in all fields of
communication. https://moody.utexas.edu/students/moodywriting
Religious Holidays:
        Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If you
miss a work assignment or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day you will be
given an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. It
is the policy of the University of Texas at Austin that you must notify each of your instructors at
least fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a
religious holy day.
University Electronic Mail Notification Policy:
        All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student
notification policy. It is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes
in his or her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular
basis in order to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain
communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a
minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your e-
mail address are available at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html
Services for students with disabilities:
        The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more
information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY, or

Counseling and Mental Health Services:
         Taking care of your general well-being is an important step in being a successful student.
If stress, test anxiety, racing thoughts, feeling unmotivated or anything else is getting in your
way, there are options available for support.
