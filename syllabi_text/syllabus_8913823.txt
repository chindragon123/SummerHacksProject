Course Description
This course will provide a general overview of Indian cinema. We will critically examine some
of the main genres and themes represented in a variety of commercial Hindi films -- popularly
known as "Bollywood". We will analyze how Bollywood films represent issues of gender, class,
race, national identity, transnational mobility, family values, cultural traditions in India and in
the Indian diaspora. We will also examine the ways in which the "Bollywood" film industry has
evolved in relation to the political, economic, and cultural changes taking place at the global,
national, regional, and local levels of Indian society. Going beyond simplistic readings that force
us to embrace either/or categories, we will focus on how emergence of “Bollywood” as a global
phenomenon reframes debates about nationalism, regionalism and transnationalism. The goal of
this course is to gain a critical understanding of the place of Indian cinema in Indian society and
culture. Background in Hindi language or Indian cinema, while helpful, is not necessary to take
this course. All films used in this course will have English subtitles.

                                                   1


COURSE EXPECTATIONS
Assigned readings. Class lectures, discussion topics and video screenings presume that all
students have completed the assigned readings for each class meeting. Since we cannot cover all
topics in detail during the lecture, it is important that you carefully go through the assigned
readings before the class meeting.
Lectures, class discussions and screenings. The lectures and screenings in this course are
designed to supplement the assigned readings. Much of the material covered in the lectures,
discussion and screenings will not be in your readings. Therefore, you are expected to take
detailed notes for all lecture material and films presented in class. In addition, you are
responsible for being aware of all assignments, handouts and announcements made in class.
ASSIGNMENTS
The assignments for this course can be divided into five categories: (1) attendance and class
participation, (2) Film analysis paper and presentation (3) Exams, and (4) Reviews of screenings.
1) Attendance and class participation. Beginning early in the semester, you will be asked to
apply the course materials through class discussions and assignments. You are not only expected
to actively participate in class, but also to demonstrate an ability to integrate the course materials
into your discussions and assignments. Therefore, your attendance is mandatory. Attendance
will be taken at the beginning of every class meeting. Attendance and class participation is
worth 10% of your final grade. Student who misses three class meetings will lose half of their
attendance grade. Anyone who misses four or more class meetings will get a zero on the
attendance and class participation grade.
2) Film analysis paper and presentation. The purpose of the film analysis assignment is to extend
our discussions beyond the listed screenings to the wide range of films discussed in the readings.
The list of “Significant Films of Popular Indian Cinema” (p. 201-216) in Ganti’s book is a good
starting point for selecting a film. The film analysis must be 4-5 pages (double-spaced, typed).
A small group (usually 2 students) will be responsible for preparing a 15 minute presentation of
the film they analyzed. Each group will provide a brief outline of their presentation to the class.
Detailed guidelines for the film analysis and the presentation will be provided ahead of time in
class. The film analysis is worth 20% and the presentation is worth 10% of your grade.
3) Exams. There will be two exams in this class. Exam # 1 will be based on materials covered in
class from August 30th to October 11th. Exam # 2 will be based on materials covered in class
from October 23rd to December 4th. Each exam is worth 20% of your grade.
4) Reviews of screenings: Over the course of semester, there will be several film screenings on
topics related to the course materials. You are required to write a review (2 pages, double
spaced) on any seven film screenings. You may submit only one review per week. The top five
scores on your reviews will be counted toward the grade for this assignment. In your report, you
should critically examine the film in relation to a particular concept, question, or issue raised by
                                                    2


a specific set of weekly readings. Each report is worth 4 points (Total 20 points). This
assignment is worth 20% of the final grade.

Scholastic Dishonesty: The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism,
unauthorized collaboration, falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid
participating honestly in the learning process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not

on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and submission of essentially the same written assignment
for two courses without the prior permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you
have agreed to these guidelines and must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonest damages both the
student’s learning experience and readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students
who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. For more

Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If you miss a
work assignment or other project due to the observance of a religious holy day you will be given
an opportunity to complete the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. It is the
                                                  3


policy of the University of Texas at Austin that you must notify each of your instructors at least
fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a religious
holy day.

policy. It is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or
her e-mail address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order
to stay current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain communications
may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice
per week. The complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your e-mail address are
available at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html. (Optional: In this course e-mail
