COURSE OVERVIEW This seminar encourages students with some familiarity with mid-20th century civil rights
movements to more deeply explore themes discussed only briefly in a broad lecture course. We concentrate
primarily on African American and Mexican American struggles involving civil rights and other issues of race.
Students consider distinct struggles while also viewing them in relation to each other, as participants often did in
that time period. This comparative and relational approach allows students to develop insights that would be
unlikely in courses with traditional approaches.
We also study how cultural understandings of
race, gender, and national identity influence
such movements.
Readings range widely, but this year the
research project will be on race and rights at
the University of Texas, 1945-1975. The goal is
for each student to contribute to a larger body
of knowledge, which will emerge out of both
individual and collaborative research and
writing, and participation in a digital
humanities project, with support from staff at
the Library and Nettie L. Benson Latin
American Collection, both at UT.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
     § To deepen knowledge of mid-20th-century campus and wider struggles around race, including civil rights
     § To gain familiarity with comparative and relational approaches to this history.
     § To further understand how cultural ideas of race, class, gender, & national identity impacted these conflicts.
     § To develop historical research and writing skills.
     § To understand how to create a digital humanities project that presents your research.

COURSE STRUCTURE
THIS COURSE IS ORGANIZED around weekly seminars, and your engagement will determine the success of the
course! I’ve built in ways for you to get involved: writing out questions on readings, participating in class
discussion, coming to office hours, visiting the Briscoe and Benson Libraries on campus, and working on a digital
humanities group research project for the second half of the semester.
NEVER CONDUCTED ORIGINAL HISTORICAL RESEARCH? DON’T PANIC! Library staff and I will walk you through it
step by step, and be available for individual assistance. YOUR RESPONSIBILITY is to get involved with course
activities, contribute to group projects, and hit all deadlines. I UNDERSTAND THAT BY READING THIS SYLLABUS
(AND REMAINING IN CLASS ;-), YOU HAVE ESSENTIALLY SIGNED A CONTRACT TO FULFILL THESE RESPONSIBILITIES.
REQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS
In addition to required published books and articles, this course will also make use of original historical materials.
Required Books: For sale at University Co-Op AND on reserve at PCL. The Co-Op will have some used copies.

GRADE VALUES (Reflects university equivalencies)
A+ = 97-100; A = 94-96; A- = 90-93             B+ = 87-89; B = 84-86; B- = 80-83
C+ = 77-79; C = 74-76; C- = 70-73              D+ = 67-69; D – 64-66; D- = 60-63               F = below 60
§ Final grades ending in .5 or above are rounded up; grades ending in .49 or below are not.
§ The registrar does not allow A+, but I use it for extraordinary work. It becomes part of your average.
ATTENDANCE
Since this class meets once a week, regular attendance is required.
UNEXCUSED ABSENCES above 1: 2 points deducted from final grade for each additional one.
EXCUSED ABSENCES include documented medical and family emergencies, religious holidays and official UT
business requiring out-of-town travel with advance written notice. If you miss an entire class for an on-campus
interview, this will not be considered an excused absence, so be sure to plan accordingly.
ARRIVING LATE/LEAVING EARLY Frequent significantly late arrivals or early departures may add up to an unexcused
absence, at my discretion. IF you anticipate having regular problems arriving by 3 p.m. sharp, please speak to me
now. Consider also dates when we meet at the Briscoe or Benson libraries and you may have a longer walk.
ASSIGNMENTS: BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS (longer descriptions on Canvas)
Reading Reflection Questions DUE 9:30 am before class, typed, double-spaced, and uploaded on Canvas. There
are just 3 of these assignments. The first will be done by all students. After that I will divide you into Group A and
Group B, and rotate assignments. Write a substantial question for each reading that you would like to include in
class discussion. By substantial, I mean a question related to a central argument of the reading. Your question
should not be about today, but about the history and ideas the authors write about. If there's a concept that you
don't fully understand, you can make that your question! Trust that what one person doesn't get, others don't get!
See rubric attached to each assignment.
Sweatt v. Painter Scavenger Hunt: In this project, we will focus on the 1950 Supreme Court decision that
desegregated the UT Law School and graduate study at other universities. It includes: 1. Following a presentation
about conducting research at the Briscoe Library, complete 2 hours of research in which you survey and study
original historical documents in an assigned part of a research collection, assess the material, and select and
photograph the document you think is most significant. 2. Fill out and upload to CANVAS a Historical Document
Analysis Form that includes identifying key themes. 3. Work with a thematically organized group to create a simple
PowerPoint to present to the class. You will work on this project both during and outside of class time.


Group Research Project: “Race and Civil Rights at the University of Texas, 1960 - 1975”
INCLUDES INDEPENDENT WORK, GROUP RESEARCH PAPER, AND GROUP RESEARCH PROJECT.
You will receive a more detailed information sheet including a breakdown of due dates on March 11.
Students will form groups of 3-4 students and choose a theme/historical moment pertaining to racial justice
struggles among African American and/or Mexican American students at UT in the 1960s and 1970s. The project
runs from March to the last class day, when groups publicly present digital timelines they have created.
Part 1: Group Research Paper
1. Students collectively complete a group project contract, outlining the focus of their research, how the digital
      project roles will be divided, how they will present their work to a public audience, and the kinds of media that
      will use to illustrate their research arguments.
2. Each group member conducts preliminary research to identify 2-3 historical events/moments within their
      group’s chosen theme/historical moment to contextualize with primary & secondary source research and
      make an argument for its significance for understanding civil rights and other racial justice struggles at UT and
      nationally. Students then complete their research and submit 2-3 double-spaced (500-750 words, 12-pt font,
      1-inch margins) pages of research and analysis for each historical event that answers questions specified in the
      assignment, using MLA parenthetical citations to reference both primary and secondary texts.
3. Group members compile their research and analysis in a shared Google Doc, and collectively write an
      introduction (1-2 double-spaced pages, 250 words, 12-pt font, 1-inch margins) and conclusion (1-2 double-
      spaced pages, 250 words, 12-pt font, 1-inch margins) that ties their individual papers together and answer a
      set of questions. A Works Cited page with everyone’s references should appear at the end.
Part 2: Group Digital Timeline Project
Students transform their research into a TimelineJS digital project to present publicly at the end of the semester. It
requires extensive group work and coordination, so each group member will take on specific responsibilities.
Group members perform peer evaluations as part of the final grade. The objective of the TimelineJS assignment is
to curate visuals and text to develop a cohesive timeline based on your research, secondary source readings, and
archival sources you have examined. The objective is to identify the main arguments in your research paper and
make them succinct and clear of jargon for a non-specialist audience. Tasks include:
1.    Creating 10-16 time points/slides with specific components, formats, and requirements.
2.    Collaborative creation of introduction and conclusion slides.
3.    Selection and uploading of print, audio, and/or audiovisual components, including credits.
4.    Compilation of all elements into group google doc using a specific Timeline JS template
5.    Group presentation of completed timeline to public audience.
6.    Reflections on project and peer assessment.
CLASS POLICIES
Names and Gender Identities: If you prefer a name or pronoun not on the roster, let me know ASAP.
Office Hours
At certain points I require you to talk with me in office hours, but I welcome you to come at other times. Contact me
if you can’t make my hours. Familiarize yourself with my concealed carry policy.
Late Assignments for Individual Work
In all cases, assignments are keyed to specific class sessions and/or group project responsibilities, so submitting them
late impacts your co-students. That said, it’s understandable if you are medically unable (or unable for some equally
serious reason) to submit an assignment on time, try to alert me or your group members in advance or as soon as
possible, and submit your work as soon as you can (discuss with me). Other than such instances, you will lose 25%
of the grade for each business day the assignment is late.
Classroom Comportment
§ I expect you to arrive by 3:00 and stay until 5:45.
§ I encourage discussion and try to create a safe environment for it. To ensure we can have conversations about


   difficult issues, I ask you to speak respectfully to others, especially if you strongly disagree.
§ I expect you to silence and stow your phones for the entire class. Take notes on paper or a different device.
§ You may use laptops to take notes but not for any other reasons.
§ Any weapon brought to class must be 100% concealed and always with you or 911 will be called.
CANVAS (https://canvas.utexas.edu/)
Assignment details, announcements, helpful tips, readings, grades, and more are on Canvas, and you’ll also upload
assignments to Canvas. For most material use links for PAGES or ASSIGNMENTS in the left menu.
SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS
Most accommodations approved by Services for Students with Disabilities will be provided, only after you bring
the form to me in office hours and discuss accommodations in person. Do this early in the semester so your
accommodations are in place when you need them. If you don’t have accommodations but think you should, visit
http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/ to schedule an appointment.
FLAGS: WRITING COMPONENT, CULTURAL DIVERSITY, INDEPENDENT INQUIRY
LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT THIS COURSE FULFILLS 3 HOURS of the U.S. history component of the university core
curriculum and covers Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board objectives for communication skills, critical
thinking, personal responsibility, social responsibility.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
UT adheres to strict guidelines regarding academic integrity including plagiarism. This is pertinent for writing
intensive courses. These guidelines extend to all material found on the Internet, in addition to print materials. They
also pertain to certain kinds of sharing work among students, such that a student submits work that is not her/his
own. Penalties for violations may include loss of credit for the course and a report to Student Judicial Services.
Familiarize yourself with these guidelines. http://www.utexas.edu/cola/history/about/academic-integrity.php
IMPORTANT. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.
The new Senate Bill 212 and Title IX Reporting require the professor to report for further investigation any
information concerning incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking committed by
or against a UT student or employee. Federal law and university policy also requires reporting incidents of sex- and
gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct (Title IX incidents). We cannot keep confidential information
about incidents you share with us. If you need to talk with someone who can maintain confidentiality, contact
University Health Services (512-471-4955 or 512-475-6877) or the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center (512-
471-3515 or 512-471-2255). We urge you to use these services for needed support and report Title IX incidents.
