Course Overview
From its earliest incarnations, the internet has been celebrated as a place where bodily concerns such as
race “don’t matter.” A sizable body of research and recent popular online trends have since proven
otherwise. This course gives students the vocabulary to critically articulate the relationships between
online technologies and embodied cultural practices that affiliate around “race” (with an emphasis on
Asian American). In doing so, this course will contextualize the topic of “race and social media” within
wider histories and theories of race, technology and the social. Broad topics include internet identities,
online communities, and social media activism, covering everything from early text-based internet identity
tourism, to the phenomenon of Asian American YouTube stars, to contemporary cultural discourses of
“Black Twitter” and the politics of social media manipulation and “Fake News.”
Note: This course adopts an intersectional approach that includes attention to gender, sexuality, ability
and nation, in addition to race/ethnicity. This course also, like social media, is participatory by design and
will require students to explore topics through both individual critical thought and applied group projects.
Course Goals
By the end of the semester, students should:
     •   Have an understanding of the multifaceted relations between race and technology.
     •   Appreciate wider histories and theories of race, technology and the social.
     •   Be able to analyze internet technologies and practices from a critical race perspective.
     •   Appreciate intersections of race, gender, sexuality, ability and nation as related to social media.
     •   Gain practical experience in the use of various online technologies, in concert with critical.
         reflection on the racialized uses and possibilities of these technologies.
Course Materials
All readings will be posted on Canvas. Students are responsible for retrieving and printing them.

Group Creative Projects             20%
Final Paper                         20%
Attendance/Participation            20%
Quizzes: At the end of “lecture weeks” (Fridays, unless otherwise stated), there will be a short quiz on
that week’s reading assignments and related themes. These quizzes are designed to test your
comprehension of fundamental concepts and may take a variety of forms, from multiple choice to short
answers. With advanced notice, a take-home quiz may be substituted for an in-class quiz.
Film Journals: During “screening weeks,” in lieu of reading assignments, in 250 words (or more)
students will compose critical responses to class screenings. These “journals” should be thoughtful and
specific—and should include both "factual" details and critical insights. Generally, you will be given a
specific question(s) to address. However, at times you will be at liberty to write about what interests you
most. Journal entries are due by Noon on Thursday during screening weeks. Journal entries will be
reviewed throughout the semester. Students are encouraged to read and engage each other’s work.
Group Creative Projects: In the spirit of social media, this class will include a series of collectively
produced creative projects, which will be housed and shared with the class via a group blog. Early in the
class, students will form into groups and, throughout the semester, these groups will be responsible for
collaborating on creative assignments. These creative assignments will be assigned during class on “lab”
weeks. Many of these projects can be completed during class time but, as needed, students are also
expected to work on these projects at home (no readings will be assigned during lab weeks). At the end
of each lab week, groups will present their projects to the class. Creativity and concept comprehension
will be rewarded—as will honest, active effort. These projects are designed to be fun, but also of practical
educational value—giving students the opportunity to engage a wide range of social media technologies
from a critical race perspective—including Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube.
Final Paper: Students will write a 5-7 page paper on a topic related to the course (specific prompt and
instructions forthcoming). Pursuant to the writing flag, this assignment will occur in two stages, with
students being required to revise and resubmit an earlier draft of their work. Papers will be presented
during the final week of class.
Class Participation/Attendance is a grade that must be earned; it requires more than being a warm
body in class. For a high grade, you must be an active participant. This means asking and answering
questions, and listening attentively and respectfully to the instructor and your classmates.
Students who are repeatedly disruptive will receive a poor class participation grade. This includes but is
not limited to: talking/whispering to your neighbor, talking/text-messaging on a phone, checking
email/playing computer games, sleeping, and noisily packing your books before class has ended.
NOTE: Missing class means missing crucial material and assignments, thus impacting your grade.
About the Course
Reading assignments should be done prior to the class period for which they are listed. Students who
fall behind in the readings will find it difficult to succeed in this course.


Class Flow: Generally speaking, “film weeks” (with film journals) will be followed by “lecture weeks”
(with quizzes), which will be followed by “lab weeks” (with group creative projects). This trajectory will
repeat throughout the course.
Computers: Please bring your laptops/Ipads/IPhones to class during lab weeks. If you don’t have one,
talk to me, and we will devise an alternative arrangement.
Cultural Diversity Flag: This course carries the Cultural Diversity flag. Cultural Diversity courses are
designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural experience.
You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the
practices, beliefs, and histories of U.S. cultural groups that have experienced persistent marginalization.
Writing Flag: This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students
experience with writing in an academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during
the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help
you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or more assignments, and you
may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of
your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications
objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by
the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
Difficult Course Content: At times this semester we will be discussing material that may be upsetting
to some students. In a class dedicated to race, the internet and social media, engagement, discussion
and critique of significant, but sometimes difficult, issues related to race, gender, sexuality, etc., is to be
expected. If you ever feel the need to step outside during one of these discussions, you may do so
without academic penalty. You will, however, be responsible for any material you miss.
Services for students with disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request
appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information,
contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.
Academic misconduct: Cheating will not be tolerated. Expect me to pursue every instance of
suspected academic misconduct in this course. Two kinds of academic misconduct are cheating on
quizzes and exams, and plagiarism (such as turning in someone else’s work, downloading a paper from
the Web in part or in whole, or paraphrasing or quoting sources without citation). Penalties range from a
zero on the assignment to expulsion from school.
The work that you turn in should honestly and accurately demonstrate your own academic efforts. Your
assignments should also reflect work done for this course. Do not turn in assignments done for another
course or attempt to pass off as “research” readings or screenings from another course.
I expect all of you to know the University’s full definition of academic misconduct and its possible
penalties. Information on academic integrity and disciplinary action is available online at
<http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/academicintegrity.html>. Please see me if you have further
questions.
A word about grades: I try to design the course so that diligence is rewarded. If you are working hard
and feel your grades aren’t reflecting this, meet with me so we can talk about studying strategies. Also,
please come talk to me if there are unresolvable issues regarding the dynamics of your blog team. Please
do not wait until the end of the semester to address this.
Grading Scale: This class will use the standard +/- system.
