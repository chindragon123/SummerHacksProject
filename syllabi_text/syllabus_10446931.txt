                                   I. Homework Assignment Policy
   1. All written homework assignments must be scanned into pdf and upload to the appropriate
       assignment on Canvas before class time (10:00 am) on the due days.
   1. Late submission: Only one late homework assignment in each category will be accepted. You
       will receive a zero (0) grade for all the subsequent late homework assignments.
   2. If you are absent on the day when a homework assignment is due, you should still submit/upload
       the assignment on time unless you are sick and unable to complete the assignment. If that is the
       case, that assignment can be submitted on the day you return to class without being considered
       late. If you forget to turn it in on the first day you return to class, it will be considered a late
       homework.
   3. Traditional or simplified characters: There are two versions for character writing: traditional and
       simplified versions. The traditional version is used in Taiwan and some overseas communities;
       the simplified version is used in Mainland China. You can only choose one version for writing,
       and that is also the version you should use when typing in Chinese during tests. Characters
       written or typed in the other version will be counted as mistakes. However, you are required to
       recognize/read both versions, as they both will be used in the tests and quizzes.
                                        II. Homework Assignments
A. Character Workbook (CWB)
B. Translation Homework (T Hw)

                                          Attendance Policy
The following rules are also applied to students who take this class for “pass/fail”.
    1. Each day’s class will consist of two sessions (Class 1 and Class 2) separated by a 15-minute
        break. Being absent from one session is considered one (1) absence. Therefore, if you miss one
        day of class, it would be counted as two (2) absences.
    2. Absence time is counted by the minute. Each accumulated 25 minutes, tardiness and early
        departure included, is considered 1/3 absence.
    3. Note that, coming to class without the Translation Homework (T Hw) draft is counted as half
        (0.5) an absence, and without the Grammar Practice draft is counted as 0.25 absence.
    4. Each student is allowed a maximum of three absences (1.5 class day or 225 minutes) without
        penalty. No excuses need to be given for these absences. Each subsequent absence (or 75
        minutes) will result in a deduction of 0.5 point from your Class Participation score. No excuses
        for these subsequent absences will be accepted.
    5. Six (6) or more absences, the penalty-free ones included, during this term will cause your
        semester grade to be lowered by one full grade (e.g., A or A- will become B).
    6. Twelve (12) absences, the penalty-free ones included, will automatically result in an F grade for
        this course.
                                            Accommodations
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of
Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice), or
1-866-329-3986 (video phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining authorized
accommodation.
                                          Scholastic Dishonesty
    1. Receiving answers for homework, exercises, or quizzes/tests from another person, whether
        that person belongs to the current CHI F606 class or not, is considered an act of scholastic
        dishonesty, and will be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students even if there is only
        circumstantial evidence.
    2. Students who do not fully disclose their linguistic background in Mandarin Chinese on the
        first class day will be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students for an investigation of
        possible scholastic dishonesty. Any dispute between the instructor and the student on this
        issue will be resolved at the Office of the Dean of Students.
    3. Any other forms of cheating will be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students.
                                             Important Notes
    1. After each of the tests and quizzes has been graded, all students are strongly encouraged to
        visit the instructor during the office hours to discuss the mistakes.
    2. Throughout the session, the CHI F606 class-related announcements, materials, or
        information will be sent out via e-mails or be posted on Canvas Announcement. It is the
        student’s responsibility to make sure that such announcements/materials/ information can
        be received in a timely fashion.
    3. Students who must miss a class, a quiz/test or an assignment in order to observe a
        religious holy day will be given the opportunity to complete the missed work within a
        reasonable time after the absence and will not be considered absent for that day. However,
        such a request must be made at least 14 days prior to the religious holy day.
    4. As a courtesy, students who must leave the classroom before the class is dismissed should
        ask for permission to do so.
                                                              7
