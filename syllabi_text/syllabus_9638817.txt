                                  Course Description and Objectives
Teaching Young Children (TYC) introduces the knowledge base and practical strategies used to
teach young children in an effective, appropriate, and asset-based manner. Moreover, it supports
you as you practice your skills in an internship placement in a prekindergarten (Pre-K),
kindergarten (K), or 1st grade classroom. By the end of this course, you will have had the
opportunity to learn how to:
• Learn strategies for establishing a culture of learning in Pre-K, K, or 1st grade classrooms,
including: positive guidance, effective routines and transitions, age-appropriate communication,
effective organization of space, materials, and time, and the use of engaging instructional
approaches and meaningful curriculum.
• Develop reciprocal relationships with parents and families through interactions in early childhood
settings to further student learning.
• Observe and document young children’s learning using a variety of tools.
• Using your documentation of young children’s learning, develop the skills to provide and
implement effective instruction based on Texas’ Pre-K Guidelines, K Texas Essential Knowledge
and Skills (TEKS), or 1st Grade TEKS including using culturally responsive teaching methods and
developmentally appropriate practices; incorporating the TEKS into the curriculum; and
establishing partnerships with parents and families.
• Begin to demonstrate professional conduct and demeanor by meeting expectations including
effective communication with UT faculty and with faculty at the placement school; adherence to
university and state policies and procedures; awareness of expectations for professional
development; and acceptance of personal responsibility for development of teaching competencies
in courses and in the field.
• Graduates of UT’s teacher education program must be effective teachers of children from all
racial, ethnic, linguistic, and socio-economic backgrounds. In TYC, you will also learn more about
how race, ethnicity, language heritage, and socioeconomic class influences the way that you teach
and the ways in which children develop, learn, and interpret their early learning experiences.

you are not expected to read or view for class, but I thought you might like to have them for your
personal collection of articles. (We will discuss this in class)
                                        Course Requirements
TYC is a course about how to work with children so that they learn with understanding. To get this
far into your careers, I know that all of you are intelligent, creative, and motivated, and I know that
you want to use your skills to become an effective teacher. Thus, I am certain that each of you is
capable of earning an A in this class—meaning that you are doing excellent work. To reach this
goal you must meet the requirements listed below.
                                       1. Professional conduct
                                      (15% of your course grade)
Attendance. Regular attendance at all class meetings is a requirement of this course: you can’t
learn if you’re not here. For each class session you miss, 5 points will be deducted from your
final grade for the course.
Each of you will be granted one Emergency Release (ER). Your ER excuses you from one class
session with no penalty. To use your ER you must notify me by email or phone BEFORE class.
(If you fail to contact me before class, you ER will not count and you will lose 5 points.) Save your
ER for medical issues, family demands, car trouble, etc. All other absences are unexcused and will
affect your grade. *Students will not be penalized for absences due to the observance of religious
holidays that fall on our scheduled class day, you must give me advance notice of these absences,
so I can make the necessary accommodations. All other absences are unexcused and will affect
your grade.
Class participation. Participation includes coming to class with your laptop, with information
gathered in your placement classroom or from your CT, and any other necessary materials;
completing all of the assigned readings for each class session; participating actively in class
discussions and activities; posting reflections and other mini-assignments linked to in-class
activities and/or to work in your placement classroom; and demonstrating a commitment to your
own learning and to supporting the learning of your classmates and the children in your placement
class. Failing to abide by these expectations will affect your professional conduct grade.
Punctuality. Coming to class on time and ready to learn is another course requirement designed to
help you learn as much as possible. When you come to class, please sign in on the Opening Question
sheet. I expect this to be done by 1PM. Your first lateness, which means arriving to class after 1PM
will be excused (it does not matter if the lecture has started or not); your second lateness will cause
1 point to be deducted from your final course grade; your 3 rd will result in another point being
deducted from your final course grade, and so on with each additional time you are late.
Development of technology skills. All interns are required to have access to a laptop computer as
part of the College of Education Laptop Initiative. Your laptop will be an integral part of this course
and should be brought to class each week; it will be used to support your learning in a range of
ways in our classroom, in your placement classrooms, and in the completion of our assignments.
Several of your course assignments are designed to build your skill in working with the tools and
software applications most useful to Pre-K, K, or 1st grade teachers. If you do not have technical


                                                                                        Lee, TYC     3
proficiency necessary to use these tools and applications, the expectation for this course is that you
will take advantage of one of the many resources available to support you in developing these skills.
Please visit the laptop help desk in room 536 in the Sanchez Building to find out more about these
learning resources.
Internship. Your experiences in your field placement are an integral part of TYC: in addition to
completing all of the requirements listed on this syllabus, you must also successfully complete all
of your field placement requirements in order to receive credit for this course. (Unexcused field
placement absences will affect your grade in this course.) Successful completion of the field
placement will be determined by your cohort coordinator in partnership with your university
facilitator and cooperating teacher (CT), and communicated to me.
Inadequate performance or professionalism during the field experience (as well as in our TYC
class) may result in the development of an Individual Performance Plan. The purpose of an IPP is
to identify clearly any aspect of student performance that is unacceptable and to establish goals and
target dates for improved performance. Failure to achieve the goals of an IPP could result in
termination of the student’s field experience.
Laptop, iPad/PDA, and smartphone etiquette. In order to support the creation of a learning
environment in our class, laptops must only be used in appropriate ways and at appropriate times.
Lectures will be posted after class on Canvas, and thus, your laptop can be a helpful reference tool
for you to use throughout the semester. Because you are a committed learner, I expect that you will
use your laptop in appropriate ways and at appropriate times, and I expect that you will not be using
your iPad/iPod/PDA, or smartphone in class. There are so many ways you *could* distract yourself
in class and your classmates–please don’t. Stay with us, and if you don’t, it affects your professional
conduct grade.
                                     2. Evaluation Opportunities
                                      (85% of your course grade)
A primary goal for all teachers is to teach their students so that they learn with understanding. My
goal as you instructor is to demonstrate this type of instruction, and to achieve this goal. I’ve
designed these activities so that they reflect what is known about how children learn with
understanding. To learn with understanding, teachers must create classrooms that are learner-
centered environments. These environments incorporate the child’s personal experiences and
cultural understanding of the world; provide learning opportunities that focus on acquiring deep
factual knowledge in a developmentally appropriate manner; teach the children how to organize
this new information in a way that facilitates retrieval and application; and, teachers must assess
their students to know how effective their instruction is and what areas their students need
assistance with in their learning.
NOTE.
*For the next 2 assignments, you will need to work with your CT to identify one focus child in
your placement classroom. When you identified your focus child, you will need to secure
permission from the parent of the child.
         Parent permission: Interns will need to secure permission from the parents to photograph
         and videotape the students in their placement classrooms; students whose parents do not
         give permission cannot be included in any project or assignment that involves photos and
         videos. In some schools, principals have determined that general school photography forms
         already signed by parents are adequate to cover interns working under teacher supervision
         for educational purposes. At schools that require separate permission forms, interns can
         use the parent permission forms found on the last pages of this syllabus; forms are


                                                                                       Lee, TYC      4
         provided in English and Spanish in accordance with AISD district regulations. Please show
         the form to your CT and/or principal before sending it home with students. (A copy of the
         permission slip for the project can be found on Canvas)
I. Observation/Documentation/Assessment (ODA) project
For this assignment, you will be creating a digital portfolio for a child that allows you to develop
the skills Pre-K, K, and 1st grade teachers use to observe and document the whole child as a
learner. For practicing teachers, this information is the foundation for planning effective
instruction, and in our class, this information will be the foundation for pulling together all of the
topics we read, observe, and discuss.
You will work with an in-class partner on this project to practice how teachers work
collaboratively and/or on teams and, especially when they need advice on how to best work
with a particular student. You will meet with your partner during “ODA Workshops” (in
class) and at other assigned times.
To complete this assignment, there are SIX steps:
Step 1. Work with your CT to pick 1 child in your placement classroom and ask about where the
child is in terms of grade level expectations: Is the student appears to be working toward grade
level expectations or appears to be exceeding the grade level? Then, after meeting with your in-
class partner, you will finalize your focal child.
**If sharing a classroom with another intern, you must choose different children.
Step 2. Create a digital portfolio assessment for your focus child that documents three areas.
     ⚫ 1 academic strength
     ⚫ 1 academic growth
     ⚫ 1 social growth
This portfolio will include ALL of the following tools for your focus child:
     Required observation and documentation tools
         1. Anecdotal observations (notes on observing the students, what you see/hear)
         2. Work samples (actual work or photos of the work)
         3. Learning photographs (students working in groups/centers/projects)
         4. Learning video (students working in groups/centers/projects)
         5. Documented conversations about learning (an intentional conversation in which you
         ask your focal students questions that will provide you insight into their learning—not an
         assessment of whether or not they know their colors or how to read specific words)
         6. Reflective notes (notes that reflect your thoughts, hunches, and questions about your 2
            students as learners—think journaling)
The requirement is that you will use at least all 6 of the tools once with this project. Each
documentation tool needs its own cover sheet, and the coversheets for these tools can be found
under Class Module #3 on Canvas. I need to be able to look at your documentation and see clear
evidence of your child’s developmental performance in relation to developmental expectations.
(An easy way to demonstrate this by comparing his/her skills to the developmental area for the 3 rd
9-week grading period.) If you disagree with developmental area projections and how they may or
may not relate to the child you have chosen to observe, please note and explain this. It is important
for you as a teacher to interact with developmental areas that districts and states provide but also
maintain your expertise as a teacher and see how children both fulfill these expectations and defy


                                                                                       Lee, TYC       5
them.
Remember, when discussing these strengths and growth areas, you are focusing on the child’s
development in relation to grade level expectations. DO NOT COMPARE your student to any
other child or children in the class. Doing so will affect your grade on this and any evaluation
opportunity we do in this class.
Step 3. To help you manage the breadth of this project, you will be turning in paper drafts of
the tools you use to document your students’ learning. This activity is designed to give you
insight into whether you are using the tools properly and how I will evaluate your work.
    On June 17, you will turn in two examples of the observation and documentation tools that
    documents a strength for your focal student. Each sample will be written in the format given to
    you in class #3 (e.g., if your tool requires a coversheet, you can find it under Module #3 on
    Canvas— in your analysis be sure to state what the strength is, what that tool tells you
    about your child as a learner, and how his/her level of performance measures up to grade
    level expectations.
    On June 24, you will turn in two examples of the observation and documentation tools that
    documents a growth area for both of your focal students. In your analysis, be sure to state what
    the growth area is, what that tool tells you about your child as a learner, and how his/her level
    of performance measures up to grade level expectations.
                        Completing the mini-assignments is worth 20 points.
Step 4. When turning in your completed portfolio on July 1st, you are to create a digital
summary sheet for EACH child. A template for the summary sheet is provided on Canvas under
Module #3. Fill one out for each child. This sheet requires you to state the child’s name; the grade
level he/she is in; a statement as to how you obtained grade level expectations; the child’s
academic strengths; the grade level expectation in relation to each skill; the forms of
documentation you have for each strength; the child’s growth area; the grade level expectation in
relation to each skill; and instructional plans for each students’ documented growth areas. (E.g., if
your child struggles with decoding words, you will provide suggestions as to how you might help
him/her develop this skill)
Step 5. Create digital portfolios for each child for class July 1st. You are to make a digital folder
for your focal child that is labeled with their name. In your child’s folder, please include the
following:
___the summary sheet for that child
___a digital folder titled Academic Strength that includes the 2 pieces of documentation for that
strength
___a digital folder titled Academic Growth Area that includes the 2 pieces of documentation for
that growth area
___a digital folder titled Social Growth Area that includes the 2 pieces of documentation for that
growth area
___all 6 of the tools are used at least once across your project and each tool has a cover sheet
Step 6. On July 1st, turn in a CD/Memory Stick that includes the 2 digital portfolios (1 for each
student).
              Again, this part of the project is DUE July 1st and is worth 10 points


                                                                                       Lee, TYC      6
II. Critical Reflection
For this assignment, you are going to choose one article from the syllabus and complete a critical
reflection on it. This is NOT an article summary. Reflection should be about 1-2pp (double spaced)
and should include your own reflections, observations or questions about the article. You need to
submit a reflection before your chosen article is being covered in class. Here are some of the guiding
questions that you can address in your reflection:
     • What stood out to you as you were reading this article? Why?
     • How does this article describe children and/or families? What is the author’s image of the
         child or family? Does this align with your own image of the child and/or family? In what
         ways?
     • What is your main takeaway from this article that will inform your teaching or interaction
         with children and families?
                           Completing this assignment is worth 10 points
Ⅲ. Learning to Teach Young Children Project. For this evaluation opportunity, you and up to,
but no more than, 4 of your classmates will develop a project that investigates an issue surrounding
the process of teaching young children that you and your group members want to learn more about.
I am open to almost any topic as long as it addresses the process of teaching young children. The
purpose behind this activity is for you to develop a ‘project’ that allows you to engage in meaningful
learning, and as such, I would like you to use the Helm text as your guide in thinking about how
this project is to evolve—>Phase 1: Choosing a topic; Phase 2: Investigating your topic; Phase 3:
Completing a culminating activity, which is your class presentation. The presentation should not
exceed 15 minutes. As part of your presentation, I would like you to create some sort of handout
for your classmates that they can take with them and use as a ‘Teaching Resource’ in addressing
the topic/issue your group investigated. All team members will receive the same grade. It is up to
you to make sure the workload is divided equally—we will create our groups in Class #3
 For the presentation, each group will have 15 minutes to explain and demonstrate to the class:
              1) How the group came up with their topic of/issue for investigation
              2) Explain the group’s plan for investigating this topic
              3) Share what you learned from this process and how it will help you and your
                  classmates teach young children
              4) Share what you and your group learned as students and as classroom teachers
                  from engaging in a ‘project’ that allowed you to investigate an issue/topic you
                  wanted to learn more about
              5) Create and send me a digital handout (sunminlee@utexas.edu) by 5PM on
                  Wednesday, June 20th for your classmates that they can take with them and use
                  as a ‘Teaching Resource’ in addressing the topic/issue your group investigated—I
                  will post it on Canvas for everyone to have
Presentations will be on June 21st. This assignment is worth 15 points. (Be sure to have
someone in the group send me your handout ahead of your presentation so that I can post it on
Canvas for the rest of the class to have.)
                        The handout is due June 20th and is worth 15 points
Ⅳ. Create and Facilitate a Pre-K/Kinder Learning Center Activity
You will be assigned to and work in groups of 4-5 to create, explain, and model with real-world
materials a developmentally appropriate Pre-K/K learning center for our class. Groups will be


                                                                                      Lee, TYC     7
assigned in the 2ndclass on May 31st, and to form our groups, we will count off by 5s. All team
members will receive the same grade. It is up to you to make sure the workload is divided equally.
Your group is responsible for providing all the materials needed to demonstrate to our class what
is required to implement such a center.
For the presentation, each group will have 15 minutes to explain and demonstrate to the class:
              1) How to set up that specific type of learning center
              2) Explain what it offers children in terms of learning and development
              3) Provide suggestions for maintaining, updating, and managing the center
              4) Specify how teachers can document children’s learning within the center
              5) Create and send me a digital handout for your classmates that summarizes the
              above points—I will post it on Canvas for everyone to have
The groups will present on the following centers:
Group 1 – Dramatic Play Center
Group 2 – Art Center
Group 3 – Reading/Language Arts Center
Group 4 – Science/Discovery Center
Group 5 - Math Center
To assist you with this activity, I’ve created a Module on Canvas titled: Readings to Help Your
Group with the Create and Facilitate a Pre-K/Kinder/1st Grade Learning Center Activity. In it,
you will find the following readings designed to help you with this project:
Establishing Learning Centers—this reading discusses how to establish learning centers as well
as the purpose behind them
Centers to support young children's learning—this reading provides a general overview of
typical centers you find in early childhood classroom and how they support children’s learning
What do I do now? How to moderate a Block Center-this reading gives insight into how teachers
can assist/work with children during block centers, and these teaching tips can be used with any
center
Cooking Center—this reading gives insight into how you might establish a cooking center, which
children love, as well ideas about how you would introduce and develop this center over the school
year
I would also suggest you carefully observe and talk with your CTs (and their colleagues) about how
they use centers in your field placements to help you generate creative ideas for your
presentation. Lastly, there are many wonderful center ideas on the Internet.
Again, presentations will begin on June 10th and continue through June 25th. This assignment
is worth 15 points. (Be sure to have someone in the group send me your handout so that I can post
it on Canvas for the rest of the class to have.)
Ⅴ. ELL Strategies Presentation
Select one ELL strategy from the 50 strategies book to display in class. Be creative and informative
and imagine this as a teaching tool if you were teaching others about ELL strategies. Include what
makes sense to you and remember to consider the creative, visual, and informative elements of
your poster. Examples might be making a tri-fold board, a stand-up open face folder, or a one-sided
flat, short or long, mini-poster.


                                                                                     Lee, TYC      8
NOTE: Upload your folder/poster photo to canvas assignment to submit for a grade.
                Poster Display on June 28th. This assignment is worth 15 points.

• All papers, assignments, and projects must be completed and handed in by the start of the class
session on which they are due. The grade on any late work will be decreased by 5 points for each
day beyond the due date unless arrangements have been made with me in advance.
• All papers must be word-processed, double-spaced, 12-point font, with numbered pages. Please
spell-check your work.
• Written assignments will be graded according to the following criteria: (1) Logic and clarity—
Have you made your point clearly? Are conclusions supported by evidence?; (2) Depth of
thinking—Is there evidence that you are making connections between personal experience, class
discussions, field placement, and readings?; (3) Attention to requirements/specifications of
assignment; and (4) Grammatical accuracy-- spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, etc.
• Meeting the basic requirements of an assignment neither constitutes nor guarantees an A. Please
refer to the University of Texas at Austin's grading system that defines the following letter grades:
A (excellent); B (above average); C (average); D (pass); F (failure). In this class A= 93-100; A-

                                   4. Course Content and Organization
Our weekly class sessions will consist of lecture, whole group and small group discussion, and a
range of in-class activities. The readings for each class session are listed in the box below the date
and topic for the class.
With most of the readings, I have given you an activity to pursue in your field placement during
that week. These activities range from pondering specific questions to discussing theories of
instruction with your CT. The goal of these activities is to help you align your thinking/observations
in your field placements with what is occurring in our class and in our readings. While there are no
written requirements affiliated with these activities, I do expect you to be able to discuss these
questions in class.
