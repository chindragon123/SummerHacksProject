Meets MW 2:30PM-4:00PM PHR 2.114                                              Office hours: W 9:30-10:30,
                                                                         Th 1:30-2:30, & by appointment
     Music is an important site of religious identity. The choice of text, the role of the human voice,
the (un)acceptability of musical instruments, as well as the significance of melody, harmony,
polyphony, and unison all play a part in the bricolages that distinguish the varied sounds of
religious music. They constitute the differences between Gregorian and Byzantine chant (the Great
Schism), Ashkenazic and Sephardic song (Jewish diaspora), Lutheran and Calvinist hymns
(Western Schism/Reformation), as well as African American Gospel and American sacred harp
shape note tunes (American Protestantism).
          Musical performance conventions – the physical embodiment of religious music – can
reflect religious conceptions of the individual in relation to the divine as well as to his or her
community. Likewise, the music rejected by a given religious community (e.g. “Rock ‘n’ Roll is the
Devil’s music!”) can be as defining as the music it embraces. Focusing primarily on the religious
music of Christianity and Judaism, this course brings to bare theory of the body/embodiment as
well as theoretical frameworks of purity and exclusion (syncretism/anti-syncretism) to show how
music is mobilized to be alternately the source of religious awe and the modus for establishing and
defining community within religious contexts in Europe and America.
          Students of this course will engage with texts, musical genre, and performance/audience
conventions of religious music. Texts will be approached as reflections of religious identity through
examination of language (including register), source (original vs. adapted text including which texts
are adapted, e.g. scripture, prayers, etc.), the relationship of the text to religious or confessional
doctrine within historical and geographical contexts (i.e. potential uses in contexts of conflict [“A
Mighty Fortress,” “Go Down Moses”] or solidarity [“Kumbaya”]). Discussion of religious identity in
musical genre (as distinct from text, and performance) will include basic musical concepts (i.e., the
level of an introductory general music class) such as melody, harmony, polyphony, unison, rhythm,
meter, instrumentation, etc. Finally, musical performance will be approached as both passive and
active phenomena – both how it is produced and how it is consumed.
          The course focuses primarily on analysis through observation. At least once during the
semester, students will attend a live performance of religious music from a tradition other than their
own as the basis of a short analysis paper. (This need not be in the context of a religious
ceremony.) A variety of opportunities will be identified for them. Student suggestions are welcome
subject to approval. Additionally, the course incorporates participant observation into the
discussion of embodiment and performance. As such, students will participate in in-class choral
singing. (Musical literacy, though welcome, is not required.) Over the course of the semester, this
experience serves as a de facto “lab component” for both our ongoing discussion of theories of the
body/embodiment and as the fieldwork for students’ short participant observer papers.
                                                                                                        1


Flags: WR (Writing) & CD (Cultural Diversity in the United States)
This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with writing in an
academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing
projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity
to revise one or more assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core
Communications objectives of Critical Thinking, Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established
by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
This course also carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural experience. You should therefore expect
a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least
one U.S. cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalization.

Attendance
If you must miss class for any reason, please let me know as soon as possible and arrange with a classmate to find out
what was covered in the day's class. Your progress in the class and your preparation for the writing assignments rely
heavily on class discussion. Being both present and prepared are crucial to your success in the class. You are
allowed two (2) undocumented absences without attendance repercussions. Each further undocumented
absence lowers your course grade by one point (i.e., after the second absence 100 – 1.0 = maximum grade of 99,
etc.). Documentation should be provided on official letterhead from your doctor, clergyman, or military superior. It must
state the date and time of your appointment or obligation explicitly, as well as the duration of your absence and contact
information of the issuing person. In case of serious illness, hospitalization, chronic disease, death in the family, severe
mental health problems I will evaluate the situation on a case-by-case basis.
Homework
The homework for RS 346 consists primarily of readings assignments. The readings are significant (ca. 20-50 pages
per assignment,) if you cannot commit to reading the material you should consider taking the course in the future when
you are able to do so. Additionally, some of your writing assignments for the class will require you to make plans to
attend the performance of religious music outside of class.
Class Discussion
I foster a classroom atmosphere in which everyone is treated respectfully. Classroom discussion of the material is an
important part of the learning process and it is important for you to feel safe and relaxed so that you can speak up in
front of the class without any anxiety, even if you are not certain that your contribution is correct. Please do not hesitate
to contact me if there is anything in the classroom that prevents you from speaking in class.
Questions? Comments? Concerns?
I value your feedback. If you enjoy your class, let me know. If there are any aspects of the class that you do not feel
comfortable with, please inform me.

collaboration.
(2) You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections

                     appreciation of what is at stake changed? (How so?) Do you believe we should take the objections (as they were
                     stated) at face value? (Why/Why not?)
