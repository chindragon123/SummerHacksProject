CURRICULUM FLAG
This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are designed to engage
students in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing a student with the
opportunity for independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related to the student’s
major. At least one-third of the grade will be based on independent investigation and presentation of
one’s own work.
THE CONTEMPORARY THROUGH THE INTERPRETATION OF THE PAST
           "We will probably be judged not by the monuments we build but by those we have
                                                                                    destroyed."
                                   New York Times editorial on the destruction of Penn Station
      "A country without a past has the emptiness of a barren continent; and a city without old
                                                    buildings is like a man without a memory.”
                                                                           Graeme Shankland
This studio will interrogate the intersections between the historic and
the contemporary engaging buildings, public spaces and the city as
a whole. The studio will focus on the design questions that emerge
when reinterpreting our past while addressing the needs of a
community in the twenty-first century. By looking closely at historic
structures, this studio calls for diﬀerent set of sensibilities and
attitudes towards design; this studio will ask you to draw inspiration
from history, to address continuity rather than disruption, to think
realistically while being innovative, and to be more aware of the
building technology necessary to materialize your design
aspirations. The goal of the studio is to engage a learning
environment based on the interdisciplinary nature of architectural
design in order to create a contemporary piece of architecture that
reinterprets the past, its values and its character.
           This studio will devote its eﬀorts to the understanding and
study of masonry examining its methods of construction,
architectural expression, and overall composition. Masonry
construction (brick and stone) is one of the oldest methods used by
the human kind, it carries a strong intelligence baggage and it is full
of wisdom. Even though it is considered a traditional material,
masonry can be used in innovative ways and when used smartly, it

can be advantageous to achieve sustainable design strategies. In
this studio you will be able to explore the load-bearing capacities of
masonry, its proper use and applications and its meaning and
character in historic and contemporary architecture. Since masonry
is usually worked with individual units of well defined dimensions,
the design process involving masonry should consider modulation,
geometry, composition and performance. In this studio you will be
asked to engage those four operations as parameters that instigate
your creativity and challenge your intellect as a designer.
          The studio will make emphasis on integration, meaning that
you are expected to achieve a resolution of the spatial, structural
and mechanical aspects of your building. Nevertheless, the building
technology should be presentes as a self-serving goal but as an
attitude towards the environment that your building will exist in, the
people it will serve, or the institution(s) it will represent. Since you will
be dealing with cultural heritage, you will be asked to think the
agency of architecture as a cultural practice. Masonry will be the
vehicle to engage an architectural production that embraces form,
space and structure informing the possibilities for community and
interaction. You will be asked to demonstrate how your design
decisions about the internal logics and constructions of your
building co-exist as an exchange between scales and systems,
between publics and culture, and the conditions, histories, and
constitutions of the city in which they live in.
INTERMEDIATE DESIGN STUDIO
Students pursuing the Bachelor of Architecture must complete four Intermediate Design Studios during
their second and third years. Building on the Foundation Design Studios taken during the first year, the
goal of the Intermediate Studios is to prepare students for Advanced Design Studios in their fourth and
fifth years.
Each Intermediate Studio will be structured around one of four broad themes of inquiry (Operational,
Environmental, Integration, and Speculation) and will oﬀer a critical framework and vocabularies for
design and development into key issues emphasized in the theme. Intermediate Studios will also serve
as a platform to prepare students for the range of oﬀerings of the Advanced Studios (e.g.
Comprehensive, Urban Design, Landscape Architecture, etc.). Intermediate Studios will follow a similar
structure, but each instructor will individually determine the scope and design problem for each studio.
THEME: INTEGRATION
This studio emphasizes architecture as a tectonic expression through structural systems, construction
methods and materiality, assembly, spatial and formal compositions, etc.

STUDIO STRUCTURE
Assignment #1: Modules and Structure
5% of final grade
Students will work in teams
This is a short exercise where you will be asked to develop a structure using a modular system (details
will be given in the assignment sheet). The goal of this project is twofold, on one hand you will be able
to explore the relationships that exist between a material, a unit, and its potential to create a larger
structure when assembled coherently. On the other hand, this short exercise will serve as initiation of
our conversations related to masonry and design
Assignment #2: Research and Analysis
15% of final grade
Students will work in groups
The first portion of this semester will focus on the study of the work of
relevant architects. In this assignment you will be asked to work
collaboratively in order to examine buildings that have been built using
masonry as the main material for construction and architectural
expression. Each case study will display specific operational and
organizational strategies, a formal and structural logic, and material
attitude. Particular attention will be given to the role of structure and
material in relation to architectural composition. Case studies will be
scrutinized across scales, ranging from the building to the detail. At
the same time, the case studies provide a vehicle to situate masonry
within the evolution of the discipline. With this exercise you will be
encouraged to reflect on the possibilities that research and
precedents oﬀer in the design process. At the end of the exercise the
entire studio group will have a catalogue of atitudes, practices and
compositions, which will introduce possibilities and limits of particular
strategies, structures, and materials for each individual design project
within the studio.
Precedents (preliminary list, may be subject to change) will include the works of the following
architects:
• Carlos Mĳares-Bracho
• Rogelio Salmona
• Eladio Dieste
• Louis I Kahn
• Le Corbusier

Assignment #3: Architectural Vocabulary, Masonry and Composition
20% of final grade
Students will work in pairs
This is an extension of Assignment #2, a design exercise where you will test the ideas studied in the
previous exercise. The underlying idea of this exercise is for you to test what you learned from the
precedents by designing something like if you were the architect (or working for the architect) you just
studied. In this exercise you will be asked to embrace a process like music students do. In music,
students play the classics as part of their training in order to develop the skills and reflect on the
complexities of the compositions they play. This gives them the background to develop their own
compositions. You will be asked to do something similar by addressing the following questions:
• What would the designers covered in assignment #1 do if commissioned this project?
• How did these architects work and how would they address this project?
• How did these architects use of masonry working with parameters such as modulation, geometry,
     performance, and composition?
• What is the vocabulary they used?
• How can I form architectural sentences, phrases and entire arguments (compositions) using this
     vocabulary?
Assignment #3: Main project (9 weeks);
60% of final grade
Students will work individually
The main project for this semester will be the design of an "Interpretation and Community Center of the
San Antonio Missions” in San Antonio Texas. The purpose of the facility is to provide information about
the Missions as Unesco World Heritage Site while providing an experience that commemorates the
history of city and performs as a contemporary gathering space. This space will combine functions of
visitors, researchers, and events related to the community. The center will also provide a culinary
experience dedicated to the hispanic culture of San Antonio. The project will challenge to use masonry
as predominant materials aiming to draw the connections between past, present and future through a
millenary material that reveals character of permanece and institution.
The project will explore how historic architecture can be reinterpreted in order to create a contemporary
piece of architecture. The purpose of this facility will be to provide a place of multi-sensory learning and
interpretation. In broad terms, an interpretation center can be considered a place of experiencing and
absorbing information, both in physical and psychological terms. The program will be approximately
4,000–6,000 square feet of delineated interpretation and gathering spaces as well as support
functions, incorporating built and natural features of the adjacent landscape. The program will have the
flexibility necessary to provide opportunities for you to develop unique visions of how the present and
the past intertwine to form a continuum while expressing the ideas of interpretation of citizens from the
twenty-first century.

The final project will be developed in four stages:
Phase 01:             Conceptual Strategy
Phase 02:             Architectural Strategy
Phase 03:             Development
Phase 04:             Representation
Each stage will have its associated scale(s) of inquiry and deliverables. In stages 1 and 2 students will
develop conceptual, formal, and structural strategies for the entire site and program, while phase 03
will be the detailed development of the project at a higher resolution. Students interested in submitting
their project to the 2019 Lyceum Fellowship Competition will have time to independently develop their
projects towards the submission deadline of March 22, 2019.

TRAVEL
San Antonio Texas is a city that is 80 miles south from the Austin area, although this is not considered
a long travel you should plan accordingly for the visits scheduled in this studio. Travel to San Antonio
will be on your own, the school will not provide transportation, neither it will sponsor any travel
expenses. Details about the visits will be presented opportunely during the studio sessions.
LEARNING OUTCOMES
Students will be exposed to a series of learning goals several times and from diﬀerent angles over the
four Intermediate Studio sequence. The goal is that similar issues are repeated from studio to studio
but from diﬀerent angles, allowing students to find, within the diversity of the topics, a “common thread”
as they go through the sequence of the four studios. The level of expectation will grow as students go
from being introduced to an issue, to becoming competent at it. Some issues would be only
mentioned in passing in one studio but will be studied in more depth in another.

STUDIO CULTURE
The School of Architecture believes in the value of the design studio model. Studio learning
encourages dialogue, collaboration, risk-taking, innovation, and learning-by-doing. The studio oﬀers an
environment where students can come together to ask questions and make proposals, which are
developed and discussed among classmates, faculty, visiting professionals, and the public-at-large.
Studio learning oﬀers intensive one-on-one instruction from faculty members, and provides the
opportunity for each student to develop his/her critical thinking skills and spatial and material
sensibilities. The design studio oﬀers a synthetic form of education, where project-based learning
becomes the foundation for developing an understanding of and commitment to the school's core
values — broadmindedness, interconnectivity, professionalism, exploration and activism — all in
service of architecture's fundamental mission: to improve the quality of the built and natural
environments.

REVIEW CULTURE
We will have frequent pin-ups, and reviews with visitors. I am a firm believer in the value of a critical
review culture. I believe in that culture the basis of professionalism is honesty. Honest public
assessment of your own work can be a diﬃcult experience. Review dynamics have an element of
instability, and criticism can often seem personal. But please note that a review, even very critical,
should be a dialogue that you, as the author of the work, should take some control over. It should not
be a passive experience on your part, either conceptually or actually. This requires a level of
dispassionate awareness and communication on your part. What are you trying to accomplish? Why is
this meaningful? What do you feel you are succeeding in? What do you understand and not
understand?

In this studio you are discouraged to present a project by describing
the chronological development of the design. You may design your
presentation any other way. A default possibility is to 1. Generally
describe the facts of what you are proposing; 2. Describe the reasons
you feel the world you are proposing is good given the specifics of the
general circumstances (trajectories in site, culture, economy, material
culture, etc.); and 3. Referencing the history and theory of
architecture, describe why you believe this is good architecture.
If you feel criticism you have received is unwarranted and personal
rather than professional, either from me or any visiting critic, do not
hesitate to speak with me about it. Note that often reviews do not
discuss what you think they should. I admire the particular discourse
that happens in reviews (just as I admire the particular discourse that
happens in desk crits). It will often seem tangential to your work; but one definition of architecture is
that it is “the activity that architects do,” and one way that a lot of architecture happens is by projection
in conversation. Your attention to the tangential discussion is as critical as your attention to the direct
discussion; the onus is on you to make clear when you do not understand the relationship of what is
being said to your work.
DESIGN CONVERSATIONS: JESSEN LECTURES
The School of Architecture oﬀers a wide range of opportunities for students to extend the design
conversations taken place in studios (Lecture Series, Goldsmith Talks, Exhibitions, etc). Students are
encouraged to participate and be engaged. Specifically, all B.Arch and BSAS students in studio are
expected to attend all the Jessen Lectures (three per semester by lead practitioners from around the
world). The lectures and the group discussions in studio that follow are important for the holistic
education of intellectually engaged students and participation will have an impact on students’ grades
(see below).

EVALUATION CRITERIA
While each project contains certain quantifiable elements for
evaluation, a significant portion of each grade is derived from broader
and more subjective criteria.
Student work will be evaluated according to its rigor and evolution
over the semester. Grades are subject to deductions for late arrivals,
absences, and late or incomplete work at the discretion of the
instructor. Missing or failing one of the exercises will fail the course.
Class participation is encouraged and it will be considered at the end
of the semester for grading.
Grading for an assignment is broken into four components, each of
which is given roughly equal weight:
Pursuit: the consistent and rigorous development and testing of ideas.
          • The ability to formulate a query or thesis and pursue a self-determined concomitant
                method of inquiry
          • The ability to identify and implement various processual mechanisms (software, sketch
                drawing and models, etc.) in the development of the design
          • Initiative as demonstrated in work ethic – Does the student do what is asked; go beyond
                what is asked; direct their own eﬀorts; eager to produce the next iteration of the design?
Grasp: the ideas and understanding of the project at hand and integration of knowledge introduced in
companion courses.
          • A strong and clearly stated design objective
          • Spatial acuity as demonstrated in plan – including reasonable disposition of programmatic
                elements – and sectional development
          • Synthetic and critical thinking; the ability to holistically organize a project as demonstrated
                through creative engagement with issues of materiality, structures and construction,

                structural and environmental system integration, building materials and assembly,
                sustainable practices, etc. in support of the design objective
          •     Structural competence and material sensitivity as demonstrated in wall thickness, floor
                plates, and assembly
Resolution: of the design objective; the demonstration of competence, completeness, and finesse in
the final design presentation.
          • Quality of presentation; clarity of communication; appropriateness of media strategy and
                level of skill displayed through the work presented at all stages of the design process;
                technical documentation
Engagement: the active participation in studio activities, leadership, collaboration, group discussions
and reviews.
A student must earn a letter grade of C or better in order for the course to count towards a degree in
the School of Architecture and to progress in to the next studio. A letter grade of C- will not satisfy
degree requirements.

X         Excused Incomplete
Can be given only for legitimate reasons of illness or family emergency. Simply not completing work on
time is not an adequate cause for assigning this evaluation. It may only be used after consultation with
the Associate Deans' oﬃces and with an agreement as to a new completion date. Work must be
completed before the second week of the next semester in which the student is enrolling, according to
the School of Architecture policy.
Grading equivalence:
Grades will be assigned using number scale. This makes it fair at the end when students obtain final
grade because the instructor uses a spreadsheet that calculates grades accurately. The Grading
equivalence will be as follows:
      A             A-            B+      B         B-         C+          C          C-           D             F

ATTENDANCE
Punctual and regular attendance is mandatory. Participation is expected. With three (3) unexcused
absences, the student’s final grade for the course will be lowered by a full letter grade. The final grade
will be lowered by a full letter grade for each unexcused absence thereafter. Aside from religious
observances, absences are only excused with written documentation of a medical issue or family
emergency. The student is responsible for completing work missed due to excused absences and
initiating communication with the instructor to determine due dates.
If a student is late (5 minutes after the start of class) three (3) times, it will be counted as one (1)
unexcused absence. Students should notify the instructor prior to class if lateness or absence is
known in advance. Students must notify instructors directly regarding lateness or absences; Asking a
classmate to inform the instructor is not acceptable.
RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
A student shall be excused from attending classes of other required activities, including examinations,
for the observance of a religious holy day, including travel for the purpose. A student whose absence
is excused under this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take
an examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable
time after the absence. University policy requires students to notify each of their instructors as far in
advance of the absence as possible so that arrangements can be made.
By UT Austin policy, you must notify the instructor of the pending absence at least fourteen days prior
to the date of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, an assignment, or a

disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Oﬃce of the Dean of Students
(471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). This letter should be

SECURITY, SAFETY, AND SUSTAINABILITY
The studio is an exceptional learning environment. Since it is a place for all, it necessitates the careful
attention to the needs of everyone. All spraying of fixative, spray paint, or any other substance should
be done in the shop. Security is a necessary component for a studio that is accessible to you and
your colleagues 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Do not leave your studio without your studio key and
do not leave your studio unlocked. Hold yourself and your studiomates accountable for the security of
your shared space.
The studio is an opportunity to apply sustainability principles, being mindful to recycle and reuse to
reduce material consumption at UTSOA. Recyclable materials should be placed in blue bins or any
other containers with white bags. The Material Exchange, a give-and-take system for students to
donate materials and take what they need for studio and fabrication coursework, is available
throughout the semester to all UT students in the UTSOA Technology Lab. All unwanted, reusable
materials should be brought to the Material Exchange station in the Technology Lab at the end of the
semester.
BCAL
Concerns regarding the safety or behavior of fellow students, Teaching Assistants (TA), or Professors
can be reported to the Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050. Calls can be made
anonymously. If something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your
concerns.
EMERGENCY EVACUATION
In the case of emergency evacuation:
     • Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
          buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
          assembling outside.
     • Students should familiarize themselves with all exit doors of each classroom and building they
          may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one used when entering the
          building.
