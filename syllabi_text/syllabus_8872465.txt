_____________________________________________________________________________________________
IN 2018, THE SUBJECT OF WOMEN AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS is no abstract matter. Recently, in ways few
anticipated, unprecedented numbers of women have joined marches, exposed sexual abuse, protested racial
violence, organized strikes, and run for office.
These movements seem spontaneous, but have
deep roots in history, forged by immensely
diverse women in myriad contexts, including not
just solidarity and victory but clashes and
contradictions. Exploring these tangled roots
illuminates what is new and not new today and
offers insights into current realities.
IN THIS UPPER-LEVEL COURSE, we examine both
well-known and barely-remembered social
movements, from those that explicitly targeted
women’s rights, like suffrage, to those that usually
did not, like civil rights. Based on lectures,
scholarly      readings,     memoirs,      historical
documents, and films, we consider not only
distinctions and intersections but power relations among groups of women.
THE TWIN GOALS OF THE COURSE are for students to deepen their knowledge of this history and to learn how
scholars in this field have developed original interpretations by beginning to do so themselves.
                                            CENTRAL THEMATIC QUESTIONS
     1)   Is the “waves” metaphor useful in understanding the history of feminism in the U.S.?
     2)   How did historical understandings of gender shape these social movements?
     3)   Why did some activists emphasize equality between the sexes and others emphasize difference?
     4)   Should one write a universal history of U.S. women’s social movements or studies organized around
          identities such as race, region, national origin, religion, and/or sexual orientation?
     5) How did power relations among women impact movements?
                                                       STRUCTURE
LECTURES FORM THE SPINE OF THE COURSE, but that doesn’t mean students are simply asked to take notes. Each
of the four units, which are organized chronologically and thematically, incorporates different forms of learning.
They include an overview lecture plus shorter or more targeted lectures, but they also contain activities such as class
discussion, analyses of original historical documents and memoirs, and evaluations of documentary films.
EACH UNIT HAS: 1) an original documents or memoir assignment; 2) an in-class group project; 3) an essay exam on
pre-circulated question involving central theme.
THE COURSE ENDS WITH a take-home final based on ONE thematic question listed above, to allow reflection on the
course as a whole.


PLEASE NOTE:
¨ THE ESSAY EXAMS ask you to articulate an argument based on evidence drawn from course materials. IF YOU’VE
   NEVER TAKEN AN EXAM like this, don’t panic. There will be many opportunities to test this out! And, of course,
   we’re here to help.
¨ ALSO, DON’T PANIC IF you feel overwhelmed with reading assignments. I will try to point out the most important
   points or sections (ask if I forget), will help you develop skills to get through material quickly, AND if all else fails
   and I find many students feel overwhelmed, I will consider adjustments.

                                                       ATTENDANCE
After 3 freebies, you lose two points from your final grade for each additional unexcused absence. Documented
medical and family emergencies, religious holidays, and official UT business requiring out-of-town travel are excused
with advance written notice (excluding interviews). Frequent late arrivals or early departures may add up to an
unexcused absence, at the professor’s discretion, especially if they involve more than a few minutes. However, if
you anticipate having regular difficulty arriving by 12:30, please speak to me.


                                                       ASSIGNMENTS
UNIT EXAMS: Two prompts will be circulated a week before the exam but only one will appear on the exam. They
involve projects historians undertake (e.g., textbooks, articles, conference papers, documentaries), in which we must
make our own claims. You will find my grading rubric and further details on Canvas.We hold 3 study sessions before
each exam. They are listed in the course schedule.
HISTORICAL DOCUMENT AND MEMOIR ANALYSES, and ANY OTHER WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS
Individual assignments ask you to analyze original sources or memoirs on a form submitted on Canvas. Please also
have it available in class. Group assignments occur in class but are usually based on material read before class. See
Canvas for details a week before individual assignments are due.
FINAL EXAM: This take-home essay will be similar in form to the unit exams, but cumulative in nature, based on a
central thematic question of your choice. I urge you to highlight these themes in your notes throughout the semester.
FORMAT: Double-spaced, 12-pt. font, title required, no bibliography but use in-text references by mentioning source
in a sentence or putting author and title in parentheses (Use (Green, date) for a lecture. File format: LASTNAME-
FIRSTNAME.HIS365G.FINAL. Use WORD if possible, NOT ADOBE because commenting is more difficult.
EXTRA CREDIT: You may raise your final grade by 1-2 points by attending an event announced on Canvas and
submitting a paper of at least 350 words discussing what interested you most at the event and why.
                                        MAKE-UP EXAMS AND LATE ASSIGNMENTS
¨ EXAMS MISSED due to excused absences may be taken for no penalty, as soon as possible after you return to
   school, or by the make-up session provided by the History Department each Friday, 2-5. If you miss an exam due
   to an unexcused absence you may still take the exam with a deduction of one full letter grade and further one full
   letter grades deducted for each Friday that passes thereafter.
¨ IF YOU SUBMIT AN ASSIGNMENT after the end of the day it is due because of an excused absence, you will receive
   full credit. If you submit it after the end of the day it is due because of an unexcused absence, you will lose 25%
   of your submission grade for each day it is late. If you miss a group project, the same applies but you will need to
   do it on your own.
                                              CLASSROOM COMPORTMENT
¨ I expect you to arrive by 12:30, sign in, and stay until class is over at 1:45. If there is a consistent reason for arriving
   a couple of minutes late or leaving a couple of minutes early please request permission.
¨ I encourage discussion and try to create a safe environment for it. To ensure we can have conversations about
   difficult issues, I ask you to speak respectfully to others, especially if you strongly disagree.
¨ I expect you to silence and stow your phones the entire class. This means taking notes on paper or a different
   device. TRUST ME that from where I stand I will see you and be distracted if you are smiling at your phone or
   nudging your neighbor to look at it. Please don’t make me call you out on it!
¨ You may use laptops to take notes but not for any other reasons. REALLY.
¨ Any weapons brought to class must be 100% concealed and always with you or 911 will be called.
