Course Description
In this class, we will explore the role of advertising in our society and in our popular culture.
Does advertising influence popular culture? Or does popular culture influence advertising? These
questions and more are at the heart of this course. We will examine various aspects of our
culture, including music, fashion, popular discourse, politics, gender and race, while making the
connection to the advertising discipline. Critical perspectives, theories and analysis will be
applied in a very practical way.
Overarching Goals and Objectives
    1)   To wake up from an illusion we call reality.
    2)   Understanding the role and significance of advertising in popular culture
    3)   Learning how to observe and analyze advertising messages from a critical point of view
    4)   Developing creative, persuasive and “my own voice” skills throughout the course of the
         semester.
Teaching Methods and structure
The course will combine lecture, media, guest speakers, discussion and students’ participation.
Course Materials

Religious Holy Days Observance Policy
The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student
from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of
a religious holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused
under this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an
examination or complete an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable
time after the absence. A student who misses classes or other required activities, including
examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in
advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an
                                                                                                  5

Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
The University defines academic dishonesty as cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration,
falsifying academic records, and any act designed to avoid participating honestly in the learning
process. Scholastic dishonesty also includes, but is not limited to, providing false or misleading
information to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment, and
submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor. By accepting this syllabus, you have agreed to these guidelines and
must adhere to them. Scholastic dishonesty damages both the student's learning experience and
readiness for the future demands of a work-career. Students who violate University rules on
scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in
the course and/or dismissal from the University. For more information on scholastic dishonesty,
please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site at http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/.
