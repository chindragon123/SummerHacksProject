Course Summary
This course is an introduction to analyzing the behavior of basic structures through quantitative methods of
conventional structural analysis and design. It functions as an applied statics course and emphasizes schematic
calculations for the design of components and connections of various structural systems. In addition, essential
design criteria and assembly techniques of the building envelope and its relationship to the overall structural
system will be explored.
The analysis aspects of this course will examine the structural behavior and application of support members
and columns in timber, steel, reinforced concrete, and masonry. Throughout the course, the student will be
required to make assessments in the areas of material, form, and fabrication.
The primary objective of the course is to provide the student with the ability to use methods and analyses, along
with rules of thumb and present-day conventions, to determine the preliminary sizing and evaluation of a total
structural system. Consequently, the student will learn to make a judgment on which structural systems and
envelope assemblies are appropriate and applicable to a specific design solution.

Building Materials and Assemblies
Format
- Lectures will cover the significant material introduced in the required reading assignments.
- Homework will be assigned at the end of each lab session and will be due at the beginning of the following
     lab. Lab sessions will review example problems similar in nature to those assignments. Late homework
     assignments will be reviewed but not credited.
- In addition to the weekly assignments, projects will constitute the fundamental course work. Late project
     assignments will be graded, but will be lowered by half a letter grade for each day late.
- Quizzes may be given without notice to cover reading assignments, which should be completed prior to the
     presentation of the material in lecture.
- Exams will be closed book and will cover all lectures, labs, and reading assignments within a given period.
- All course material (course description, syllabus, assignments, projects, readings, grades, etc.) will be
     available on Canvas at canvas.utexas.edu

Attendance Policy
Attendance is mandatory in all lectures and labs. Students can have three (3) unexcused absences – for any
reason – without penalty. Each additional absence, regardless of the reason, will lower the final course grade by
one full letter grade.
Religious Observances
A student shall be excused from attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the
observance of a religious holy day, including travel for the purpose. A student whose absence is excused under
this subsection may not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete
an assignment from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy
requires students to notify each of their instructors as far in advance of the absence as possible so that
arrangements can be made to complete an examination, assignment, or a project within a reasonable time after
the absence. A student who fails to complete missed work within the time allowed will be subject to the normal
academic penalties.
Grading
Final grades are derived from homework and quizzes, three semester exams, and the semester projects.
Grading is based on a 100 point scale as follows:
A         93 - 100
A-        90 - 92
B+        87 - 89
B         83 - 86
B-        80 - 82
C+        77 - 79
C         73 - 76
C-        70 - 72
D+        67 - 69
D         63 - 66
D-        60 - 62
F         59 and below
The individual grades accumulated over the semester are averaged towards the final grade as follows:
Homework                    10%
Exam 1                      20%
Exam 2                      20%
Exam 3                      20%
Projects                    30%
NO INCOMPLETES WILL BE ALLOWED.


Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities who require special accommodations must obtain a letter that documents the disability
from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of the Dean of Students (471-6259 voice or
471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). This letter should be presented to the instructor in
each course at the beginning of the semester and accommodations needed should be discussed at that time.
Five business days before an exam the student should remind the instructor of any testing accommodations that
will be needed.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to
discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a
partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the
Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-
5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Policy on Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the
individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. For further information, visit the SJS website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs or call 471-2841.
