          Semester: Spring 2020                                               Prerequisites: One of the following: E 303C (or
          Cross-lists: AFR 317F                                               603A), RHE 306, 306Q, or T C 303C (or 603A).
Description: This course will engage with African American literary and cultural traditions from plantation slavery
through the contemporary moment, tracing the ways in which the past informs the present. In addition to reading
poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, and critical texts, we will also listen to music, watch films, and explore Black
visual media. Throughout the semester, we will pay particular attention to themes including racial formation,
gender, and sexuality, and to how Black writers, artists, and activists respond to structural injustice.
The primary aim of this course is to help students develop and improve the critical reading, writing, and thinking
skills needed for success in upper-division courses in English and other disciplines. They will also gain practice in
using the Oxford English Dictionary and other online research tools and print resources that support studies in the
humanities. Students will learn basic information literacy skills and models for approaching literature with various
historical, generic, and cultural contexts in mind. In this course, we will explore our identities as readers, thinkers,
and writers, which will serve us throughout our lives as individuals and professionals. Consequently, the focus of
this course will be on developing creative and critical thinking, expanding our knowledge of literary and cultural
traditions, and understanding literature and writing and as a social process.

COURSE POLICIES
Office Hours
Students are encouraged to come by office hours at least once during the semester to discuss their progress and
any additional questions. (I’m happy to meet by appointment if my scheduled office hours don’t work for you.)
Attendance
Prompt, consistent and engaged attendance is crucial to success in this class. In the event of an absence, you are
responsible for getting notes and any missed handouts from fellow classmates, whom you can contact through the
Canvas email function. You are allowed three unexcused absences, after which your attendance & participation
grade will be lowered one level (for example, from A to A-, from A- to B+, etc.) for each subsequent unexcused
absence. Note: 6 or more missed classes (excused and/or unexcused) will result in automatic failure of the course.
