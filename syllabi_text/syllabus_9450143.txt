Abstract
       An introduction to game scripting using Unity and C#. In future semester this course will be
       replaced with Game Scripting I. This course will cover a variety of scripting techniques for game
       systems including combat, multiplayer, saving and loading, menus, and managers.
Assessment
       All homework assignments are equally weighted toward 60% of the final class grade, 10%
       each. There are 7 total homework assignments so you can drop the lowest grade. The final
       project will be worth 30% and will be graded based on the provided rubric. The remaining 10%
       will be based on attendance and professionalism. Assignments are due by the start of class on
       the due date. A bonus opportunity to publish your final project will be worth 5% of the final
       grade.
       No late work will be accepted. No incompletes will be given. If you feel you will not be able to
       complete all work on time, you should ask the instructor for a grade of Q or drop before the
       deadline for doing so passes.
       Note: If you cannot attend class for any reason, please send an email and attach any
       class work as needed, and talk to your classmates to find out what you missed.

Grades
Homework Assignments: 60% (7 total, drop the lowest)
Attendance and Professionalism: 10%
Final: 30%
Bonus: 5%
Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric. Please note: to ensure
fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will
be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not recognize the grade
of A+.
A = 94-100
A- = 90-93
B+ = 87-89
B = 84-86
B- = 80-83
C+ = 77-79
C = 74-76
C- = 70-73
D+ = 67-69
D = 64-66
D- = 60-63
F = 0-60
                                                                                                     4


Class Attendance Policy
As detailed above, attending class during the scheduled meeting times earns professionalism credit.
Credit is NOT earned for arriving late, leaving early, or failing to attend class meetings. If attending a
scheduled class meeting is not possible, students are expected to promptly notify the instructor of
extenuating circumstances.
Q Drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to
six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:“Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of
higher education may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses,
including any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher education, unless
the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
University Attendance Policy: Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the
date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD)
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities
(512-471-6259, ssd@austin.utexas.edu, http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/, or videophone 512-471-
6644). Please provide documentation of your needs during the first week of class, if possible, so that I
can make the necessary accommodations promptly.
Academic Integrity
The University's Honor Code states that “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide
by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” You are expected to maintain
absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in scholastic work undertaken at the
University. At a minimum, you should complete any assignments, exams, and other scholastic
endeavors with the utmost honesty, which requires you to:
    ● acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts;
    ● complete your assignments independently unless expressly authorized to seek or obtain
         assistance in preparing them;
    ● follow instructions for assignments and exams, and observe the standards of your academic
         discipline;
    ● and avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another
         student.
(adapted from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php)
Academic Dishonesty
In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines academic dishonesty
as including any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved academic advantage, such as:
    ● Cheating
    ● Plagiarism
    ● Unauthorized Collaboration / Collusion
    ● Falsifying Academic Records
                                                                                                           5


     ●   Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain an
         extended deadline for an assignment, or even gain an unearned financial benefit)
     ● Multiple submissions (submitting essentially the same written assignment for two courses
         without authorization to do so)
     ● Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity
(adapted from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php)
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
(from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_faculty_syllabus.php)
Plagiarism
“Plagiarism” includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining
by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source, including words, ideas,
illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting that material as
one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program course requirement
(from Sec. 11-402, http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-
discipline-and-conduct/).
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice
Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided
through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health
Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police
Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when
a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies
regarding evacuation: • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building.
Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building. • If
you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class. • In the event
of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless
you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire
Prevention Services office.
Student Support Services
There are numerous free and/or low-cost support services available to students at UT. They include
(but are not limited to) the following:
Fine Arts Career Services (512-232-7333, utexas.edu/finearts/careers) provides a full range
of services and resources to support students and alumni.
The Undergraduate Writing Center
(512-471-6222, uwc.utexas.edu) helps students with every phase of writing assignments for
their courses.
The Sanger Learning Center (512-471-3614, utexas.edu/ugs/slc) provides study skills,
time-management, and note-taking courses.
University Health Services (512-471-4955, healthyhorns.utexas.edu) provides medical and health
promotion services for currently enrolled students and some non-students who are

                                                                                                            6


UT Electronic Mail Notification Policy
Electronic mail (e-mail) is a mechanism for official University and instructor communication to students.
Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with
University- and course-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-
critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week.
It is the responsibility of every student to keep the University and instructor informed of changes in his
or her official e-mail address (do so at https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/bio/address_change.WBX).
Consequently, e-mail returned to the University with "User Unknown" is not an acceptable excuse for
missed communication. Similarly, undeliverable messages returned because of a full inbox or use of a
spam filter will be considered delivered without further action required of the University or instructor.
(see http://www.utexas.edu/cio/policies/university-electronic-mail-student-notification-policy)
