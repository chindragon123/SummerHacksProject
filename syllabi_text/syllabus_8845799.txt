Course Description:
        This upper division course surveys key themes in the domestic politics and
political economy of postwar Japan from historical, comparative and theoretical
perspectives. After a brief introduction to prewar politics, we will explore the
impact of the American Occupation (1945-52) on the postwar Japanese political
system, the secrets of the Liberal Democratic Party’s (LDP) extraordinary
dominance in postwar elections, the rise and fall of the postwar “miracle” economy,
the quality of civil society, and gender politics. We will devote our final sessions to
Japan’s painstaking movement toward political-economic reform.
        Our sessions will employ a variety of different approaches, including lectures,
films, guided discussions, class analysis of assigned readings, and newspaper
articles on current events. Students are strongly advised to attend classes regularly,
since many of the topics addressed in the exams will be explored only in the lectures.
        Politics in Japan, which carries the “Global Cultures Flag,” is designed to
increase student familiarity with cultural groups outside the U.S. Over the course of
the semester, we will pay close attention to the cultural and institutional
foundations of Japanese politics, and with reference to comparable Western and
other Asian experiences.
Prerequisites: 6 semester hours of lower division Government courses. No prior
knowledge of Japan is required. Graduate students may take this course for
graduate credit.
