Text The textbook for the first exam is the partial text: Cell Biology: From Molecules to
Cells by Martin Poenie. I am not sure what it will cost but I will not be making money off
the book. For the remainder of the course, I will supply notes that are going into the
remainder of the text. Optional for the course is Molecular Biology of the Cell Alberts et
al., 6th edition
iClicker. We will be using the iClicker system in class as a way of taking roll, gathering
feedback and assessing the classes understanding of the material. You need the
IClicker device. We have had too much trouble with the phone app. You can obtain
them from the COOP. Please remember to bring them to class.
Mandates for the course
I have written notes for each lecture and students are responsible for the material in
them.. I expect that students will have gone through those notes before class and I will
call on students to answer questions. My plan is not to discuss every point in the notes,
Rather we will focus on a few key areas.
We will be using Canvas for notes and posting grades.
http://canvas.utexas.edu/
A note about the notes: Giving you notes is not meant to substitute for going to lecture.
Students who get the notes and do not come to lecture almost always do poorly or at
least worse than they could have done. I try to keep notes up to date but I can and will
discuss issues in lecture that are not in the notes (or in the book).
Exams and Grading


The grading for the exam will be based on quizzes (mini exams) given in discussion
section. Each quiz is worth 50 points. We will drop the lowest score. So, there will be
450 points total.
Final Exam
The final exam is comprehensive and will be worth 100 points. You can, if you choose,
take the final. Two things can happen if you take the final. First, after we have dropped
your lowest quiz score, if your final is better than your quiz average you can substitute
the final exam (100 pts) for your next two lowest quiz scores (100 points). If the final
exam brings your average down when we substitute for quizzes, then we will not count
it. In that case, we will just use your top 9 quiz scores for your grade. You do not have to
take the final if you are satisfied with your results on the quizzes.
Attendance
We give 50 points for attendance in the belief that you will do better if you attend class
than if you don’t. We allow for three missed classes before points are subtracted. After
that, it goes down 3 points per class. This is the general policy. There can be exceptions
due to special needs or arrangements that are established ahead of time.
If no final
9 Quizzes (dropping lowest) = 9 x 50 = 450 pts
Attendance = 50 points
Total = 500 points.
If you take the final
7 Quizzes (dropping three lowest) = 7 x 50 = 350 points
Final = 100 points
Attendance = 50 points
Total = 500 points
Attendance and in class review questions are taken by IClicker
Final grades: The basic grade scale is:
100- 91% = A
90-89 A-
88-86 B+
85-83 B
82-80 B-
79-78 C+
77-70 C
69-67 C-
66-65 D+
64-62 D
61-60 D-
< 60 F
There may be reasons to “curve” the class or adjust the scale. However, any
adjustments will only be made when all exams are completed and only if deemed
suitable according to our judgment. We will not restrict the number of A’s, B’s etc. If, for


example, you get a 91% average in the class, you will get an A regardless of how many
other students also scored in the 90s.
Advice on studying for exams: The study questions are meant to call attention to areas
where we often ask questions for the exam. If you want to know where to focus, focus
on coming up with good answers to the study questions. If you are having trouble
answering the study questions, discussion sections or office hours are good times to
work on that. The lecture material is not exactly the same as material covered in each
chapter in the textbook. If a subject from a book chapter was not discussed in lecture, it
will not appear on the exams.
Exam Policies
Cheating: We expect honest effort and honest exams. If we discover cheating on an
exam, the exam will be given a 0 score. More serious administrative action may follow.
We will make efforts to prevent cheating such as seating students apart. Baseball caps
need to be turned around or hats may need to be removed.
Use of pen on exams: If you use a pencil to write your exams we will grade the exam
but we will not accept the exam for regrades or corrections. Use a permanent-ink pen!
Leaving the Room - Visiting Restrooms during exam: It is your responsibility to be ready
for an exam. Once the exam has started we will not permit students to leave the exam
room and then return to their exam.
We will check IDs as you hand in Exams, so BRING YOUR STUDENT ID OR
DRIVER’S LICENSE TO EACH EXAM.
Addition Errors and Regrade Policy: If you think an addition error has been made, bring
the exam to the TA. If you think you deserve additional points for an answer, you must
submit the entire exam to the professor or TA for regarding. You must either provide a
written description of which question(s) you want regraded and why, or you must
discuss it with the professor or TA in person. Remember that grading mistakes can be
made in either direction and we rerserve the right to regrade the entire exam! You have
one week only after exams are returned to submit for a regrade (No exceptions and no
end-of-semester regrading of earlier exams!).
Academic accommodations for students with disabilities:
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact
the
Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY. Or at
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/
Accommodations for religious Holidays:
As per University policy, accommodations will be made for religious holidays. A student
must
make the instructor aware of a needed religious-related absence at least fourteen days
prior to
the class absence or on the first class day for holidays that fall within the first two weeks


of the
semester.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty:
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from The
University.
Since such dishonesty harms the individual and all students.
Performance during the semester: If, at any time during the semester, you are disturbed
by your performance in the course, SEEK HELP IMMEDIATELY from the professor
and/or the TA. My suggestion is to focus and spend time on the study questions. Most
of the exam is derived from topics covered in the study questions.
