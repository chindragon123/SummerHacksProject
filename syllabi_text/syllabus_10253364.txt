Course Description:
This course focuses on the history of medieval Europe, primarily through the lens of material
culture. In addition to manuscripts, we will explore the significance of several categories of material
artifacts. We will discuss what we can discover about the production, circulation, reception, historic
and geographic context, and the meaning attributed to the materials from which these objects were
created. This class explores what these objects reveal about the religious, political, economic,
cultural, and intellectual history of medieval Europe, beyond what we can learn from medieval texts
and how these objects may have been experienced in a pre-modern world.
Objectives:
    • Learn to analyze and articulate meaning from primary sources created in the Middle Ages -
        both textual content and material culture.
    • Learn to read and think critically about pre-modern time periods.
    • Become more aware of material culture and the significance of space in both the medieval
        and modern world.
    • Develop a deeper understanding of cultures and beliefs that may be different from our own.
        (Note that this course has a Global Cultures flag and is cross-listed with Religious Studies)

Class Expectations:
I expect you to attend class regularly, be prepared to take notes, and to participate actively and
respectfully in discussions. The required reading assignments must be completed BEFORE class.
Bring your course packet to class.
Required Presentation:
Ten minute class presentation on a medieval material object selected from list provided by professor.
You are required to turn in a short paper with answers to the Who, What, When, Why, and How for
the object you have chosen and include at least two secondary sources that you used. (Note that the
sources may NOT be Wikipedia). This paper will be due two weeks before your scheduled
presentation.
Additional Class Policies and Notes:
    1. Sign up for initial 10 minute visit in my office during the first two weeks of class.
    2. Computers and tablets will NOT be allowed in this course (unless you provide
        documentation that accommodation is needed).
    3. Turn off your phone for the duration of the lecture, or place your phone on vibrate. NO
        PHONE use allowed during class. If your phone rings, I reserve the right to answer it.
    4. Attend all class meetings, arrive on time, and sign the daily sign-in sheet. After two
        absences, each subsequent unexcused absence subtracts 5 points from your class
        participation AND attendance grade. Excused absences require a note to the professor
        BEFORE class or within one week after the missed class.
    5. Make-up exams will be made available IF you have a documented, excused absence on an
        exam day. Notify me as soon as you know you cannot take an exam as scheduled.
    6. There will be NO make-ups on quizzes.
    7. If you will miss class to observe a religious holy day, notify me at the beginning of the
        semester, or at least fourteen days prior to the date of your absence.
    8. If you miss class, obtain notes from your classmates and come to office hours if you want to
        discuss what you have missed.
    9. Power point presentations will be available on Canvas, but these presentations are
        supplemental to the lecture and do not stand alone.
    10. Please do not record lectures.


                                                                                                      3
   11. You will be expected to treat others in the class with respect and to listen to the questions,
