Land Acknowledgment
We begin this syllabus by recognizing that we stand on the shared lands and waters of the ​Comanche and
Tonkawa. We express our respect for the three federally-recognized nations: Alabama-Coushatta, the
Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas, and the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, within the state as well as other
Indigenous peoples and nations such as the Karankawa, Caddo, Lipan Apache, Comanche, Wichita,
Coahuiltecan, Neches, Comecrudo, and Mission Indians that have historic ties to these homelands. We
also acknowledge the multiple ways the State of Texas and the residents of this Land have benefitted from
the forced and systematic removal of Native peoples from Texas. ​Land acknowledgements are a small
step toward correcting the stories and practices that erase Indigenous histories and the ongoing
presence of Indigenous peoples today. As teacher educators and researchers, many of us are complicit
in this erasure, and it is imperative that we recognize, support, and advocate for the sovereignty of
Native nations in our work.
                                             Course Description
    This course will explore qualitative case study methodology. Students will engage with issues of
    origin, development, design and debate regarding case study methodology. To do this, students will
    conduct close readings concerning these issues from a research design perspective and dialogue with
    one another as they consider published studies and develop their own qualitative case studies.
                                                Course Goals
    By the end of the semester, the successful student will:
    1. Articulate case study’s place within broader paradigms of inquiry, philosophical frameworks and
        research traditions
    2. Understand key issues, differences and debates in the development of case study in relation to
        other qualitative methodologies
    3. Collect and/or analyze data using case study methodology
    4. Develop a case study manuscript or proposal
    5. Present original research orally and in writing

    a class member so that you are prepared for the next class session.
    Religious Holy Days​:​ ​By​ ​UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least
    fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an
    examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you
    an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Class sessions will include short lectures, small and whole group discussions, virtual responses, and
student presentations. In order to accomplish the goals of the course, classes are designed for ​active
participation​. Students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the assigned material. Your
perspectives are appreciated, needed, and respected, and should be shared. Students’ grade will depend in
part on ideas and understandings developed in class.
