Lab Access
You will need access to SPSS and Excel to complete lab assignments and many of
the problem sets. Both programs are available in RLP 1.402 & 1.404, which you can
access when classes are not in session (see the posted schedule for availability).
SPSS may also be available in COLA labs at BAT 1.130, MEZ 4.128, and HRH 4.102B.
If you wish to work on your own computer, a six month license of SPSS can be
purchased online for around $35. Excel is available for free through UT’s Office 365
Portal.

Personal Pronouns
Class rosters provided by the university have your legal name. I will
gladly honor your request to address you by a different name, and
by the gender pronouns you use. Please advise me of this preference early in the
semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.
Attendance
Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class. You may miss up to four
class days (regardless of the reason for the absence) with no penalty. For each
additional absence beyond four absences, I will deduct 3% points off of your final
grade. There is no exception to this policy. If you do not plan to attend regularly,
you should not take this class. Students who miss class will be responsible for the
material covered and announcements made in class.
Late Work and Make-Up Policy
Late work will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Please communicate with me if
you are having problems keeping to the schedule. It is better to talk through
problems than ignore them. There are no make-ups for missed quizzes, but you
can miss two quizzes without penalty. Make-ups for all other assignments and for
exams are only offered with proper documentation of a UT-sanctioned absence.
Email me as soon as possible to discuss.
Q Drop Policy5
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop
before the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester.
Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any
public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
Religious Holy Days
UT Austin policy requires that you notify me of your pending absence at least
fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must
miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a
religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within
a reasonable time after the absence.
Incompletes
In accordance with departmental and university policies, I will not grant an
incomplete except in cases with unusual circumstances.

Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and
assemble outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made.
Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
  Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building.
   Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you
   entered the building.
  If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week
   of class.
  In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class
   instructors.
  Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire
   Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services
   office.
  Academic Integrity
  The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery,
  freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each student in
  the course is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust,
  fairness, and respect toward peers and community (see
  http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php).
  For this course, collaboration is not allowed on any assignments. Any work
  you submit for academic credit must be your own work. You are encouraged to
  study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and
  the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive
  "consulting" help from classmates. However, this permissible cooperation
  should never involve one student walking another student through a problem
  from start to finish, or one student having possession of a copy of all or part of
  work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file,
  a saved data file, or a hard copy. Should copying occur, both the student who
  copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be
  copied will automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation
  of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University
  disciplinary action.

Counseling and Mental Health Center
All of us benefit from support during
times of struggle. You are not alone.
There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important
part of the college experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support
sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences
any academic stress, difficult life events,
or feelings like anxiety or depression, we               Credit: CollegeDegrees360
strongly encourage you to seek support.

                 Appendix: The Meaning of Grades
For students, the grading process can be a mystery. After completing your essay or
exam, it may seem that they are sent off to a place where grades magically appear
at random. I want to assure you that this is not the case. Just as you put time and
effort into completing your assignments and exams, I put time and effort into
grading them. This means that I do read every word of your essays, papers, and
exam answers. Whenever possible, I will have detailed grading rubrics that allow
me to deduct points in the same way from each student’s exam. In the case of
response essays, in which a specific grading rubric is not practical, the following
describes my view on what makes an answer worth each letter grade:
A       Work surpasses the requirements of an assignment by adding new insights,
        creativity, and/or particularly thoughtful analysis or applications. In “A”
        answers, students demonstrate a complete understanding of the course
        material, have clearly stated purposes, and support their ideas with
        examples when appropriate. Few changes, corrections, or suggestions can
        be made regarding the accuracy of information or the effectiveness of
        communication.
B       Work meets the requirements of the assignment. In “B” answers, students
        demonstrate a solid command of the course material, support their ideas
        with examples when appropriate, state their purposes, and apply concepts to
        another context if applicable. “B” work is clear and effective, has good
        organization, and has clearly expressed ideas.
C       Work partially meets the requirements of the assignment. In “C” answers,
        students demonstrate an acceptable command of the course material and a
        basic ability to apply concepts, support their ideas, and state their purposes.
        A “C” may indicate work that has some gaps and errors or communication
        that is inconsistent or difficult to follow.
D       Work marginally meets the requirements of the assignment and has many
        areas that need improvement. Often “D” work indicates an attempt to
        merely repeat the material from class discussions without further insight or
        consideration.
F       Work does not meet the requirements of the assignment. “F” work is
        consistently weak, reflecting little thought or effort.
