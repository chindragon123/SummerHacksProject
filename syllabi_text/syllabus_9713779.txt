Course Overview:
This lower-division, lecture course provides an overview of global development from
roughly 10,000 BCE to 1500 CE. It introduces students to the main political, social, and
cultural trends in a variety of societies while at the same time stressing the global
perspective. Considerable emphasis is therefore paid to comparative history and the
study of cross-cultural encounters. While covering the content of the human past, we will
also investigate methods of historical study to discover how history is constructed from
both material remains and written sources. "The Premodern World" thus aims to teach
historical thinking as well as historical content, impart a basic understanding of the
premodern past, and stimulate the development of large-scale frameworks for historical
analysis.
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering
the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
Grading Procedure:
Two exams (to be held on Oct. 16 and Dec. 9) will comprise 50% of your course grade,
while two quizzes (on Sept. 25 and Nov. 6) will be worth another 25%. Exams and
quizzes will consist of both short answer and essay questions. Students will work in
groups to research an object of power and create a Google Slide about it three times
during the course of the semester–this objects of power project will count for 20% of
your overall grade. Another 5% of the final course grade will be based on attendance and
participation in class activities.
We will NOT be using pluses and minuses for the course grade.
