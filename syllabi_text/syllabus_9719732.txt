Objectives — —To gain an understanding of the archi-

                                                         —To consistently sustain a coherent

             tool
             —To reveal connections between archi-
             tectural ideas and urban relationships by
             using a research thesis as a methodolog-
             ical device to approach design
             —To interpret findings gained through
             speculative research and to translate
             them into projective designs
             —To perform rigorous research on the
             specificity of the project context, not
             only its physical attributes but also its
             regulatory, cultural, social, and economic
             properties
