OH: T 1-3 and by appt.
This course introduces doctoral students to major texts in social theory that have been foundational
for sociocultural anthropological thought and method. Focusing on classical scholarship of modern
social science, it traces genealogical trajectories that have influenced the discipline of anthropology
in a variety of ways. While not a comprehensive history of anthropological theory, the course
provides a (mostly) chronological and (often) contextualized perspective as it explores and interprets
epistemological, methodological, and ethical concerns from the Enlightenment to the present.
Requirements
Participation is essential (10%). You are expected to attend all classes and be prepared to discuss the
assigned readings. As a seminar, and the shape of the course emerges through the participation of
those present. The course emphasizes close reading, engaging with texts on their own terms while
drawing out connections between the authors and situating their work historically as relevant.
Presentations & reading responses (15%)
Class will start with a student presentation intended to launch the discussion. Each student will
present twice during the semester. The presentations should not be summaries, but engage central
concepts, methods of analysis, and critical concerns. You might elect to address significant issues
raised by the readings, trace a concept across texts, compare and contrast the position of two or
more authors, provide a close reading of a dense passage, and/or address unresolved or confusing
issues. On days on which you are presenting you should also write a discussion paper of 250-500
words, to be distributed to all members of the seminar. For the most part there will be 2 students
presenting each class, and you should work together to either prepare a common presentation or to
engage with different parts of the readings.
Papers (75%)
You will write 3 papers during the semester. For the first two (5 pp./12 pt. font, due week 6 & 10),
prompts will be provided. For the third (7 pp./12 pt. Font, due 12/10), draw on an author from the
3rd part of the course to engage and analyse an aspect of your dissertation research. Papers should
have a clearly stated thesis in the introduction that is developed through the body of the paper and
synthesized in the conclusion. Aim for a cogent, thoughtful discussion of the readings. Late papers
will not be accepted. Each paper is worth 25% of the overall grade.


University Writing Center
I strongly encourage you to use the services offered by the University Writing Center. The UWC
offers 45-minute, one-on-one consultations with UT students on any piece of writing. You may visit
up to three times per assignment. The consultants are well trained, and the cost of the service is
covered in your tuition. If you wish to make an appointment, you may do so through the UWC
website: uwc.utexas.edu.
