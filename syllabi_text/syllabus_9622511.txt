Course description
This 6-week summer option examines the life course of Mexico’s Revolution through both its armed
and post-revolutionary phases, from about 1910-1940. During the semester we will focus on several
key questions. What kind of revolution (agrarian, political, social, cultural) was the Mexican
Revolution? What caused and drove it? What did ordinary people think about the revolution and how
far did they shape its course or simply suffer in its wake? Did “many Mexicos” just produce many
revolutions, or can broader narratives be discerned? What were the main contours of Mexico’s post-
revolutionary regime, and how different were they compared to those of the old regime?
Thematically, the course will cover central topics such as the Porfiriato (1876-1911);
the maderista revolution of 1910-1913; the rise and fall of popular movements (zapatismo, villismo)
from 1910-1920; the Constitutionalist successes of 1916-1917; and the political and cultural
construction of post-revolutionary Mexico by Sonoran (1920-1934) and later cardenista (1934-1940)
state-builders, agrarians, schoolteachers, and anticlericals. The course will consist of some brief
lectures; group discussions of set readings, primary documents, and folk songs (corridos); and
occasional viewings of documentary or theater films made during (or about) the revolutionary years.
To do well in the course, you will need to develop your analytical skills (e.g. concerning different
interpretations of the Revolution, not just matters of fact); your compositional skills (by presenting a
reasoned, opinionated case on paper); and your communication skills (by contributing to
discussions). Since this is a short term, asessment will be in the form of weekly papers, a map quiz,
and a longer, final paper.
By the end of the course you will have acquired a broad theoretical sense of what constitutes a
social revolution and a detailed knowledge of Mexico’s revolutionary history that will help you to
make up your own mind about the $64K questions: did twentieth-century Mexico truly experience a
revolution? If so, how “revolutionary” was it?
i. Course materials: set texts
Everyone should acquire and read the following texts, which are essential for assignments and
for class discussion. These texts have been chosen to provide you with a mixture of classic and
some of the best recent scholarship on the revolution by Mexican, North American, and European
historians. I have also tried to suggest books that offer clear contrasts, to help you to situate your
own thinking about the Revolution. These books will challenge each other’s claims concerning the
character of Mexico’s revolución and help you to form your own opinion about the events of 1910-
1940. Starred texts (*) available online as ebooks via UT Library.

v. Assignments
 There is no final exam. Instead there will be the following, cumulative assignments:
 (i) Map quiz – Short answers on regions, states, geography (WEEK 2)
 (ii) Short papers – 4x 1-2 pp. double-spaced essays (DUE IN WEEKS 2-5)


 (iii) Final paper – 5-6 pp. double-spaced essay (DUE FRIDAY WEEK 6)
For the final paper you may choose one of two options: either, answer a standard question; or, if
you prefer, select an individual topic for secondary research. Individual essay topics for the final
paper must be agreed with me beforehand (START OF WEEK 5) and may include such themes as:
women in the revolution; organized labor; revolutionary anticlericalism; Church-state
relations/the Cristiada; educational crusades; the ejido; state-level revolutions; the 1938 oil
expropriation; caciquismo; U.S.-Mexican relations; the myth of the revolution. The aim here is for you
to familiarize yourselves with relevant bibliography on your chosen topic, then produce a more
detailed paper on an agreed question.
vi. Grading policies
 (a) Weighting of assignments.
 Individual assignments will be weighted as part of the total course credit as below:
 Map quiz (10%)
•     Reading papers (x4 @ 15% = collectively, 60%)
•     Final paper (30%)
 (b) Grading scale
 At the end of the semester, the accumulated % will be converted into a final letter grade for the
course. UT (Fall 2009) has now introduced a plus/minus scale for both semester and final course
grades. The grading scale in this course takes advantage of this and will be as follows:
 Percentage              Grade
 93-100%                 A
 90-92%                  A-
 87-89%                  B+
 83-86%                  B
 80-82%                  B-
 77-79%                  C+
 73-76%                  C
 70-72%                  C-
 67-69%                  D+
 63-66%                  D
 60-62%                  D-
 Below 60%               F
vii. Course Format & Schedule (provisional and subject to review)
