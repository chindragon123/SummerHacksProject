   grading of homework and exams. Do not hesitate to contact her with any homework
   or grading problems. Her office location will be announced in class and posted on
   Canvas.
5. Text: Granof, Government and Not-For-Profit Accounting, 8th edition (New York:
   John Wiley, 2019). A student website accompanies the text. It contains Power Point
   summaries of each chapter as well as other material that you might find helpful. It
   can be accessed at: http://bcs.wiley.com/he-
   bcs/Books?action=index&bcsId=9806&itemId=1118983270
6. Canvas: The instructor will post on Canvas the course syllabus, announcements,
   supplementary readings, old exams, solutions to homework assignments and
   computer files. You will be held accountable for all materials posted on Canvas.
   The computer files (mostly in Excel or Word format) are generally templates that will
   serve as the basis for class discussion. You are strongly advised to check Canvas
   prior to each class meeting and to either print or download to your computer the
   relevant templates.
7. Exams and quizzes: There will be two 75 minute exams and a final. In addition
   there may be occasional short (5 minute), unannounced, quizzes. A grade of zero will
   be assigned for any quiz that is missed. However, in calculating final grades, the
   lowest quiz grade will be dropped. The quizzes will cover the text material assigned
   for the day.
   Under no circumstances will a student be permitted to take an exam before it is
   given to the class as a whole. The final exam is tentatively scheduled for


Syllabus: Accounting 380K.6
Page 2 of 7
    Wednesday, May 15 from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon. Do not make plane
    reservations for a flight before that date.
8. Written Assignments: Written problems have been assigned for almost every class.
    These assignments are to be turned in on the days that they are due. The assignment
    schedule (including dates of exams) is subject to change during the semester.
    You will be held accountable for all changes that are announced in class or
    posted on Canvas.
    The written assignments will be marked satisfactory or unsatisfactory. They will
    count toward 10 percent of your final grade. You will start with a score of 100
    points. You will be permitted to miss one assignment without penalty. Thereafter,
    you will lose ten points for each assignment missed and each marked unsatisfactory.
    However, if you miss an excessive number of assignments, the instructor, at his
    discretion, may report a course grade of "incomplete” pending submission of the
    missing assignments.
    Assignments should be submitted electronically via Canvas. Late assignments will be
    accepted only in unusual circumstances and with instructor permission.
     If you are planning to take the CPA exam in the near future you should consider
    reviewing all the exercises (as opposed to problems) in the text, especially the
    multiple choice questions.
9. Continuing Problem: A “continuing problem” has been assigned for each of the
    chapters in which one is included. This problem requires that you review the
    comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR) of Austin. Use the report as of
    September 30, 2017 (the latest available). The report is available on the internet at:
    https://assets.austintexas.gov/financeonline/downloads/cafr/cafr2017.pdf
    In answering the questions included in these problems you need not provide elaborate
    explanations – a phrase or two, plus the page or schedule in which you found the
    answer, will be adequate.
10. Research questions: Several of the homework questions are labeled “Questions for
    Research, Analysis and Discussion” and deal with current accounting issues. Many
    of these questions ask for your opinion. They may not have a definitive answer.
    However, for the perspective of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, you
    are encouraged to consult the Board’s standards and other pronouncements. These
    can be found on the Governmental Accounting Research System (GARS), which can
    be accessed through the American Accounting Associations website:
    http://aaahq.org/ascLogin.cfm

    To log in, enter AAA75945 as the username and Acce7594 as the password. The
    GARS is also available in the UT Library’s Accounting Research Manager electronic
    data base. Although your written response may be exceedingly brief, you should
    most definitely consider carefully the issues addressed.
11. Class Participation: You are required to attend class and you are strongly
    encouraged to take an active part in class discussions. Do not hesitate either to
    present your own views or to challenge comments of the instructor or your
    classmates. Because the class sessions will generally be discussions rather than
    lectures, it is essential that you come to class having completed the assigned
    homework. Your final grade may be severely affected by poor preparation for,
    or absence from, class.
12. Use of Computers in the Classroom: The instructor permits students to use laptops
    or tablets in the classroom. Many of the files made available on Canvas are designed
    so that students can insert journal entries, numeric values and notes in the course of
    the classroom discussion. However, electronic devices are not to be used for other
    purposes, such as checking e-mail, surfing the web or working on assignments
    for other courses. Accordingly, students should not connect to the internet
    during class sessions.
13. Name Cards: Students will be required to bring their name cards to class and display
    them at all times. Should you forget your card, or not have been provided one, please
    ask the instructor for materials to make one.
14. Grades: Grades will be determine as follows:
          Final exam                              37.5%
          Hour exams                              37.5%
          Quizzes (If given)                      10.0%
          Written assignments                     10.0%
          Class participation                      5.0%
                                                100.0%
    If quizzes are not given the points assigned for them will be divided between the final
    exam and the hour exams.
    Final grades will be established by rank in class, not absolute number of points.
    Consistent with University policy, plus and minus grades will be assigned.
15. Review of Examinations: Upon your request, the instructor will review your
    examinations for errors in grading. Papers will be accepted for regrading no later
    than two weeks after the class period in which the exam has been returned to the
    class at-large.
16. Verification of Grades: Student grades, including points earned for homework, will
    be posted on Canvas. You are responsible for making certain that your grade is


Syllabus: Accounting 380K.6
Page 4 of 7
    properly recorded, that you have received credit for all homework submitted and for
    notifying the TA or instructor of any errors. No errors will be corrected after the final
    grades have been submitted to the registrar.
17. Honor Code: The instructor strongly supports the honor system as described in the
    “Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty in the MPA Program and the
    Professional Program in Accounting.” By enrolling in this course you implicitly agree
    to accept the student responsibilities described in these documents. If at any time
    during the semester the application of the policies to specific assignments is unclear,
    it is your responsibility to request clarification.
.
18. Recording Devices: The use of recording devices is prohibited, unless explicitly
    approved by the instructor.
19. Students with disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request
    appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For
    more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641
    TTY.
