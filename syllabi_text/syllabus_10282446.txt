Course Description
In this class, we will explore the role of advertising in our society and in our popular culture.
Does advertising influence popular culture? Or does popular culture influence advertising? Is
there a dominant culture? What is missing in pop culture?These questions and more are at the
heart of this course. We will examine various aspects of our culture, including music, fashion,
popular discourse, politics, gender and race, while making the connection to the advertising
discipline. Critical perspectives, theories and analysis will be applied in a very practical way.
Overarching Goals and Objectives
    1)   To wake up from an illusion we call reality.
    2)   Understanding the role and significance of advertising in popular culture
    3)   Learning how to observe and analyze advertising messages from a critical point of view
    4)   Developing creative, persuasive and “my own voice” skills throughout the course of the
         semester.
Teaching Methods and structure
The course will combine lecture, media, guest speakers, discussion and students’ participation.

Title IX Reporting:
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender based discrimination, sexual harassment,
sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational
institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:1.
Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.2. Provide support and remedies to
students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies. Faculty members and certain
staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters,” which means that
they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible
Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-
on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be
sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or
remedies without making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more
                                                                                                            5

Religious Holy Days Observance Policy
The Texas Education Code specifies that an institution of higher education shall excuse a student from
attending classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious
holy day, including travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may
not be penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment
from which the student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. A student who misses
classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day
should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be
made to complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of
The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic
integrity. “Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not
your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be
guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are
responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code.
Personal Pronouns
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics
dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance,
and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name, unless they
have added a “preferred name” with the Gender and Sexuality Center
(http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/publications-and-resources/ ). I will gladly honor your
request to address you by a name that is different from what appears on the official roster, and by the
gender pronouns you use (she/he/they/ze, etc). Please advise me of any changes early in the semester so
that I may make appropriate updates to my records.
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn
differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me
know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements
of the course. There are also a range of resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
                                                                                                            7


This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical
information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building
needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning
environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible.
I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. Any student with a documented disability
who requires academic accommodations should contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-
6259 (voice) or 512-410-6644 (Video Phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining
authorized accommodations. For more information, visit http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/.
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and
cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning
how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. If you or anyone you
know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we
strongly encourage you to seek support. http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html
The Sanger Learning Center
Did you know that more than one-third of UT undergraduate students use the Sanger Learning Center
each year to improve their academic performance? All students are welcome to take advantage of Sanger
Center’s classes and workshops, private learning specialist appointments, peer academic coaching, and
tutoring for more than 70 courses in 15 different subject areas. For more information, please visit

Student Emergency Services in the Office of the Dean of Students has launched UT Outpost (UA9
Building, 2609 University Ave; ring bell for service) to support students on our campus that is equipped
with a food pantry, and a career clothes closet to ensure every Longhorn has access to professional clothes
for job and internship interviews. Emergencies and financial hardships can interfere with student success
beyond the classroom, and this program will serve as an additional resource for students.
