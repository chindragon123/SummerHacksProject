The Behavioral Image
Instructor: Jacob Stewart-Halevy
Spring 2020/ Office Hours WCP 5.140 Tuesday, 2-4
                                           Course Description
How do we visualize our behaviors and what do we do with these images? This upper-level
course takes place at the intersection of two major traditions during the Cold War period: The
attempt by artists, critics, and art historians to locate styles of comportment within artworks
broadly defined; and the creation of images of behavior across the social sciences. The course
should be of interest to those concerned with connections between aesthetic and scientific
approaches to conduct, the history of photography, film, video art, and media theory.
