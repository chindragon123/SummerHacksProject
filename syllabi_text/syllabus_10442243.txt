          industries and markets to be studied in case analyses.
7.        To enhance your written and oral communication skills.
8.        To improve your ability to work in a group environment.
9.        To increase your skills in independent business research and information analysis.
10.       To provide you with a practical understanding of how to conduct business in a global economy.
COURSE METHODOLOGY
The primary vehicle for achieving the course objectives will be case analysis. A case is a synopsis of a "real
world" problem or situation faced by an organization. You will respond to the case by analyzing the
problem/situation to determine the key issues, objectives, and management alternatives, and then
determining the best course of action for the organization being studied. These cases will be discussed in
class, allowing you to develop, exhibit, and refine your analytical and problem-solving skills. Since the cases
deal with international business problems, developing your analysis and solution will allow you to reinforce
and apply international business concepts, tools and techniques. You will submit various assignments over
the course of the semester to help you practice and apply the core concepts learned. In addition to case
analysis, the course will involve lectures and will involve a limited number of additional reading assignments
and discussions.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
         Your performance in the course will be determined on the basis of the following items:
         1 Individual Written Case Analysis                                                          20%
         1 Group Region Analysis Written Report & Presentation                                       25%
         1 Group Business Case Introduction                                                          15%
         Group Peer Evaluations                                                                      5%
         Class Participation                                                                         15%
         Final Exam (Take-Home)                                                                      20%
         TOTAL                                                                                       100%
Your final grade is computed as follows: (93+ = A; 90-92.99 = A-; 87-89.99 = B+; 83-86.99 = B; 80-82.99 = B-;
77-79.99 = C+; 73-76.99 = C; 70-72.99 = C-; 67-69.99 = D+; 63-66.99 = D; 60-62.99 = D-; <60 = F)
GROUP ACTIVITIES
The class will be divided into groups of four to six students for group projects. You will have two group
assignments during the semester, which together are worth 40% of your grade. Group tasks are common in
business, so your group assignments in the class will be a useful learning experience. One group assignment
will be a region analysis presentation. The second group assignment will be a business case presentation.
At the end of the semester, you will be asked to provide confidential assessments of each of your group
members' performance (not including your own). Anyone who is evaluated poorly by fellow group members
will be penalized on his/her peer evaluation grade. Also, a group may, with my permission, "fire" a group
member. That individual must then persuade another group to "hire" him/her or complete the assignments
independently.
Group Business Case Introduction
Each group will be assigned one case. For this case, the group will develop a thorough analysis and present
this analysis to the rest of the class. You may think of this assignment as a consulting project. The group will
play the role of a consulting team hired by corporate management to analyze a business problem. The class
will assume the role of a team from within the company assigned the task of evaluating the consultant's
proposal. Each group will have 25 minutes for the oral presentation with the remainder of the class period
devoted to questions and answers and discussion of the case. There will be no written assignment for the
group case introduction. The business case introduction will be worth 15% of your final grade.
Group Region Analysis Presentation
For this assignment, each group will be required to conduct a thorough analysis of a geographic region
within the context of a specific industry. You may choose the region and the industry you would like to
research from the list provided on the course schedule, or your group may propose a custom project.
However, your region topic and research plan must be approved by me. To this effect, a short report (1-2
paragraph) on your research plan should be submitted to me by Wednesday, June 17th. This report should
include information on the: 1) topic for the region/industry to be analyzed; and 2) planned individual
division of labor in group activities (who will research and present which topics).
The purpose of this analysis is three-fold. First, it will enable you to develop your skills in international
strategic analysis. Second, you will become acquainted with how and where to obtain information on


IB F395 / MAN F385 – Summer, 2020 – Syllabus                                              Page 3 of 9
different geographic regions and specific business characteristics of these areas. Finally, you will benefit
from the knowledge you gain about a particular region as well as the regions other groups are investigating.
Each group must submit a written report of their Region Analysis. Reports should be no more than 15 pages
(single-spaced) exclusive of exhibits. Your research must be properly referenced with either footnotes or a
reference list and the report must include a bibliography. In addition, each group will make an oral
presentation on their analysis. The oral presentation should last approximately 25 minutes, plus 5 minutes
for questions and answers from the class. For your Region Analysis, your written report will be worth
approximately 3/4 of your grade and your presentation 1/4. Every member of a group MUST participate in
the oral presentation. Your region analysis overall is worth 25% of your final grade.
INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITIES
Written Case Analysis
A Written Case Analysis is a thorough report of your analysis of a case. Your analysis must be individual
work. The specific case for your written analysis is noted in bold on the course schedule. The case analysis
should include a clear, concise, problem statement, an identification of key facts, an analysis of the
implications of the salient facts, detailed recommendations and a well-formulated implementation strategy.
Each analysis should be 5-7 double-spaced pages in length exclusive of exhibits and appendices. Your case
analysis will be worth 20% of your final grade.
Class Participation
Because so much of your learning in this course will come from in-class discussions of the cases, class
contribution/participation is an important component in determining your grade. The quality of your
contribution will be directly related to your preparation for class before each discussion. Therefore, it is
IMPERATIVE that you prepare thoroughly for each class discussion with notes to guide you.
I will evaluate your performance after each class meeting. I will call on you in class and you will be expected
to provide relevant and original answers. You may have one "question free" day during the semester. On
this day I will not call on you in class. To exercise your "question free" option you must inform me prior to
class on the day you do not wish to be called on.
Keep in mind that quantity of discussion is not a substitute for quality of discussion. At the same time,
attendance is NOT a substitute for contribution: you must contribute verbally in class to earn points toward
your class contribution grade.
Final Exam
At the end of the semester, you will be provided with a take-home exam that you will have 48 hours to
complete. The exam will be an essay that will require both independent research, analysis, as well as
evidence that you are able to apply the skills learned over the course of the semester in a real-world,
practical business scenario.
OTHER CLASS INFORMATION
I reserve the option of giving reading assignments in order to evaluate (and encourage) your preparation for
class. The assignments scheduled are the ONLY components of your grade in the course. Other assignments
to improve your grade will not be accepted and should not be requested.


IB F395 / MAN F385 – Summer, 2020 – Syllabus                                                Page 4 of 9
LATE ASSIGNMENTS
No work will be accepted after the beginning of class on the day the assignment is due unless prior
arrangements have been made with me. Work submitted late will receive a grade of ZERO.
ATTENDANCE
Because class contribution is such an important component of your grade, and more importantly, your
learning in this class, attendance is mandatory. You will be allowed one absence to be used as you wish,
including illness, job interviews, religious holidays, and any other reason. Each further absence will result in
one point being deducted from your final grade in the course. If you have more than one job interview that
conflict with class, you must document ALL interviews and provide the information to me in order to receive
an exception to the absence limit. There are NO OTHER EXCEPTIONS.
It is also important that you be prompt to class. Being late to class disrupts the other students and
interrupts the discussion. Please make every effort to be in class and ready to participate when class starts.
Persistent tardiness (arriving late for class over three times - and I do keep track of tardiness) will constitute
a missed class on your attendance record. In order to be counted present for class, you must have video
active on your Zoom feed unless expressly granted an exception for the class in question by either myself
or the TA for the course.
ACADEMIC HONESTY
Academic honesty is expected on all assignments. This means that all individual work is INDIVIDUAL. You
are not to discuss your case analysis or case briefs with other students in this class, other classes, classes
from previous semesters, or any other student at this or other universities. You are also not to use written
case analyses from previous semesters, club/sorority/fraternity test files, study guides, or any other material
pertinent to the cases unless you initiate that information yourself (i.e. library references). If you have ANY
DOUBTS as to what is acceptable activity, ask me before proceeding. You diminish yourself and the
University when you engage in any dishonest activity or submit anything other than purely original work.
Any breech of this requirement will be penalized "to the full extent of the law". At the very least you will
earn an F in the course, and you may be dismissed from the University.
By teaching this course, I have agreed to observe all of the faculty responsibilities described in that
document. By enrolling in this class, you have agreed to observe all of the student responsibilities described
in that document. If the application of that Policy Statement to this class and its assignments is unclear in
any way, it is your responsibility to ask me for clarification. Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty: Students who
violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility
of failure in the course an/or dismissal from the University. Since dishonesty harms the individual, all
students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You
should refer to the Student Judicial Services website at http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/ or the General
Information Catalog to access the official University policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well
as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic dishonesty.
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity
and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 471-6259.

FINAL COMMENTS
International Operations Management may be the most difficult, demanding, and frustrating course in your
business education. As an integrative course, assignments are designed to let you "put it all together" and
apply what you have learned in many other courses to real business problems. You will also be presented
with some new information to learn through readings and cases. The emphasis on case analysis requires
simultaneous attention to both detail and the big picture. You must see the forest but analyze the trees as
well. It involves a mindset that forces you to integrate, to be imaginative, and to be decisive in situations
with limited information. Developing a mindset, a way of thinking, is much more difficult than learning
specific information or techniques. You must learn to think analytically. You may find the course
requirements and the evaluation to be very demanding. However, facing demands is the surest way I know
of to learn and grow.
Whether you ultimately work in business in an international setting, or some entirely different pursuit, the
understanding and skills you gain in global strategy formulation, analysis, and problem solving will have
application. Whether you rise to the helm of an organization or are involved in specific functional areas,
understanding organizational strategy, being able to integrate and analyze information, and being able to
formulate and commit to decisions will enhance your performance and your contribution to any
organization.
Finally, this course can be very enjoyable. Despite some of the formal and stringent rules in the course,
much of the class discussion can be spontaneous and creative. More than most other courses you have had
in college, your learning will be determined more by what you do than what I as the instructor can teach
you. I can simply guide. If you will commit yourself to preparation, apply yourself to the tasks at hand, and
then open yourself up to learn what you can from the process and from other students I think you will find
this among the most enjoyable and worthwhile courses you will have in your business education.
