COURSE DESCRIPTION
                                    This course is concerned with the history of race as an organizing
                                    principle of empire. How have ideas of race and racialization
                                    provided justification and motivation for imperial formations? In
                                    conversation with other parts of the world, this course will focus on
                                    empire, race and social movements in the Americas. We will
                                    examine how the pursuit and maintenance of empires by Western
                                    states was (and is) deeply tied to notions of race, with particular
                                    attention to legal thinking. As part of the course, we will also
                                    explore various (and contested) critiques of empire, anti-colonial
                                    movements and their corresponding “freedom dreams.”
*The title of the course originates in part from Penny Von Eschen’s book, Race against Empire: Black Americans
and Anti-Colonialism, 1937-1957.
