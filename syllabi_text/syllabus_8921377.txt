Course Description:
In his 2017 latest Man Booker Prize short-listed novel, Exit West, Pakistani author Mohsin Hamid
muses: “and when she went out it seemed to her that she too had migrated, that everyone
migrates, even if we stay in the same houses our whole lives, because we can’t help it. We are all
migrants through time.” In light of an international refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase
in deportations from and immigration restrictions to the US, what does it mean for the
contemporary Asian-American novel to imagine the migrant, and the “migrant through
time”? How might the 20th and 21stcentury “Asian-American novel”—in the various ways that
we may define or destabilize the category— help make visible contemporary and older debates
about the displacement of bodies, immigration, and the complicated relationship between a
homeland and a diaspora?
As a class we will read a range of novels and secondary materials to explore issues of race,
imperialism, diaspora, citizenship, and gender in the project of constructing “Asian-American”
identity. Our readings will invite questions such as: what is the very idea of “Asian-American
literature” and what contemporary political utility might it have? What can Asian-American
novels teach us about historical Asian diasporas’ cultural and labor contributions to our present
day understandings of “America,” and about the intimate relationship between US foreign policy
and Asian refugees rehabilitated in the US? How might such literature force us to consider the
ways in which recent-anti-immigrant rhetoric in the US and elsewhere works to erase those older
histories? Finally, how does the contemporary Asian-American novel complicate and unsettle the
conventional immigrant narrative of moving permanently from a disadvantaged homeland to a
new land of promise? What do we do, for example, with immigrant characters who voluntarily
leave the US to return to other homes?
Academic Goals: The primary aim of this course is to help students develop and improve the
critical reading, writing, and thinking skills needed for success in upper-division courses in English
and other disciplines. Through short stories, novels, graphic novels, film and TV clips, and
scholarly criticism, we will learn to:
     1. Close read: to observe and analyze a creative text’s language, imagery, narration, form,
          and genre
     2. Think through the story-telling and truth-telling techniques of different forms and genres
          of writing and what “fiction” writing means
     3. Effectively utilize UT’s libraries and the internet for primary and secondary resources
                                                                                                     1


     4. Contextualize a given text with cultural, social, and political history
     5. Recognize themes and conflicts in Asian-American literature and how they have changed
           with time in relation to the formation of Asian-American studies
     6. Write proposals for academic papers and in a persuasive way that focuses on literary
           works and effectively incorporates appropriate secondary materials
Cultural Diversity in the US Flag: This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the
United States. Cultural Diversity courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety
and richness of the American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at
least one U.S. cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalization.
Writing Flag: This course contains a writing flag. The writing assignments in this course are
arranged procedurally with a focus on invention, development through instructor and peer
feedback, and revision; they will comprise a major part of the final grade.
Required Texts: **Students must purchase physical copies of the following texts and bring
the text we are reading to class. **
Feel free to purchase used copies and other editions—we will use chapters/ sections as references
in class discussion, so page numbers do not need to be consistent amongst all of us. I encourage
you to support local bookstores like BookWoman and HalfPrice Books or, alternatively, online
used bookstores like Abebooks.
**All other readings—short stories and scholarly criticism—will be provided by the instructor/ or
will be posted on Canvas.**

Letters to Memory, Karen Tei Yamashita (2017, Coffee House Press)
Exit West, Mohsin Hamid (2017, Riverhead Books)

Requirements and Grading:
You will have 3 papers to write over the course of the semester, which will make up the majority
of your grade (70%). An important component of writing academic papers is the editing and
revising process, as well as collaboration with instructors and peers. We will have individual
student conferences for your first paper, which you will then revise and resubmit based on
feedback. For the final paper, we will conduct an in-class proposal workshop where you will help
peers in their brainstorming stage. Apart from papers, your class attendance, participation, class
activities, Canvas blog posts that reflect on readings, and short class presentations will also
contribute to your final grade.

Paper 1: Textual Analysis + Close Reading — 10%
Paper 1 Revised Draft—10%
Information Literacy Response—5%
Paper 2: Guided Contextual Analysis—20%
Paper 3 Proposal + Presentation—10%
Paper 3—25%

                                                                                                   2


Grading Scale: A (91-100); A- (90-93); B+ (87-89); B (84-86); B- (80-83); C+ (77-79); C (74-76);
C- (70-73); D+ (67-69); D (64-66); D- (61-63); F (0-60). The university does not recognize the
grade A+.
Class Policies:
    a) Attendance: You are allowed 3 unexcused absences, after which your final grade in the
        course will fall a half letter grade (so from A to A-, A- to B+, etc) for each subsequent
        unexcused absence. An excused absence must be for a serious or extenuating
        circumstance and have proper documentation (ex. Jury duty, religious holy day,
        hospitalization). If the nature of your absence is anticipated (such as a religious holy day),
        you must notify me of your absence one week before your absence. If the absence is
        unanticipated (such as a family emergency), you must bring in documentation when
        you’re back.
    b) Participation: Your participation throughout this course will constitute 5% of your
        final grade—for our collective learning as a group, it’s important for everyone to
        contribute! I encourage you to participate in order to cultivate your ability to articulate
        yourself, to build confidence in your voice, and to demonstrate that you are alert and
        have completed any assigned readings or exercises. Please remember that your voice is
        important and should be heard! You will have various opportunities to participate inside
        and outside the classroom: through your verbal contributions to each class discussion,
        class activities, and through initiatives taken to engage with material at office hours (if you
        feel inhibited to speak up enough in class). I will evaluate your participation by taking
        detailed notes of your contributions, but also negligence (falling asleep in class, being on
        your phone, tardiness, etc.) each class.
    c) Tardiness: Please be on time! If you are over 15 minutes late, you will be considered
        absent for the day. If you’re a few minutes late very occasionally, I will understand, but if
        this becomes a habit it will adversely affect your participation grade.
    d) Getting In Touch and Email Etiquette: Please email me
        (amrita.mishra@utexas.edu) for any questions or concerns, or to schedule an
        appointment to meet, if you are unable to make my office hours. I will be happy to get
        back to you, but as a doctoral student and human with many other commitments outside
        of teaching, I will respond within a 24 hour window. Keep this time frame in mind so
        that you do not email me an urgent concern about an assignment just a few hours before
        it is due. It is also important to remember that no grade-related queries may be addressed
        through email, due to FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) regulations.
        Such concerns can be discussed during office hours/ an appointment.
        For your academic and professional development as college students, it is important to
        compose and structure emails appropriately. I expect you to write emails with a salutation
        and named recipient, and sign off with your name. For example:
        Hi/Dear Amrita (any salutation and addressed recipient),
        This class has changed my life! (email content)
        Sincerely/Best,
        Student (any appropriate sign-off with name)
                                                                                                      3


   If you choose to send an email without appropriate etiquette, I will ask you to send the
   email again before responding to your concerns.
e) Submitting Work: Hard Copy and Electronically on Canvas:
    Each writing assignment must be both submitted as a hard copy in class and submitted
   electronically on Canvas by the beginning of class on the due date (12:30), apart from
   (approximately bi-weekly) blog posts, which you will only submit on Canvas. It is
   imperative to submit both, because I like to read and comment on printed-out copies, and
   use Canvas to record grades, use rubrics, and keep track of all submitted assignments. If
   you submit only a hard copy or on Canvas, you will automatically lose 5% of the total
   points allocated to the assignment, so please remember to do both. If you are absent on a
   submission day, you must turn in a hard copy of your assignment in our next class period,
   otherwise you will incur the penalty; it is not my responsibility as an instructor to print out
   student assignments. The penalty is meant to encourage you to ensure that you submit
   both ways. Make sure you have enough time to print out an assignment before class in
   anticipation of number of unwanted variables—the printer not working, your computer
   crashing, etc.
f) Late Work: You have been given due dates for all assignments (right here, on this
   syllabus!) on the first day of our semester together, so please plan ahead to make sure you
   can submit everything on time. You will notice that all assignments are due at 3:30 pm, in
   class. For each day (24 hr period) that an assignment is late, you will lose 5% of the total
   points available. In case an assignment is late, you should submit on Canvas, and then
   bring a hard copy to the next class period. The late penalty also applies to all Canvas
   discussion posts.
   If you have extenuating circumstances, you may request an extension at no penalty, but
   this request must be made at least 48 hours before the assignment is due. If you submit
   an assignment after the agreed extension date and time, you will similarly lose 5% for
   each day that it is late.
g) Grading Policy: As your instructor and someone invested in your academic
   improvement and success, I will spend a considerable amount of time deliberating on
   grades for each assignment. I will usually give you a rubric of how assignments will be
   graded before they are due. If you’re uncertain about why you received the grade that
   you did for a particular project, please spend at least one day going through my
   comments and thinking through your assignment before bringing concerns to me at office
   hours or at an appointment. It is not a good idea to try to talk about a grade a few
   minutes after you’ve received it. If you strongly feel that you deserve a higher grade, you
   will need to submit a single-spaced one-page explication of your reasoning.
h) Technology Policy: A literature and writing class that contains elements of peer
   feedback and in-class workshops requires the cultivation of community amongst peers,
   and a space where we can engage fully with one another. Throughout the semester you
   will be writing, looking at others’ writing, and discussing texts together. To build
   community and not hide behind screens, no technology (laptops, phones, tablets, etc)
   will be permitted. I am particularly strict on the usage of phones—if you are texting
   during class it’s always obvious and fairly distracting to your peers as well as to my
   teaching. If I see you on your phone, I will address the issue immediately as a warning,
   but if I see this happening again, you will be marked absent for the day. If you have
   special requirements to use technology, please see me so that we can work something out.
                                                                                                4


   Occasionally we will require technology—to work on papers in class, workshop, or to
   practice research skills. I will ask you to bring a laptop / electronic writing device on
   those specific class days. No technology in class means you must bring physical
   copies of all assigned texts to class.
i) Accessibility: Your success in this class is important to me. If there are aspects of this
   course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as
   possible. We will develop strategies to meet both your needs and course requirements
   together. I am committed to making all course materials as accessible as possible, and to
   working with students if any of these materials are inaccessible. We will all need some
   accommodations in this class, because we all learn differently. If you need specific
   accommodations, let me know. Any conversations we have about accommodations are
   confidential. I am happy to take extra steps to ensure accessibility for all students.
   Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations
   should contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-
   329-3986 (video phone) as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining
   authorized accommodations. More information is available on the Services for Students
   with Disabilities website at http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd
j) Safe Space Policy: This class strives to be a safe space for learning and development—
   a space where we can develop and refine the knowledge and skills necessary for culturally
   competent practice. We may sometimes need to stretch beyond our comfort zones to
   learn, but at the same time we need to feel safe. In order to create such an environment,
   please be respectful towards all colleagues. There is no tolerance in this space for slurs or
   derogatory language, or discrimination based on race, gender presentation, marital status,
   religion, disability, age, or sexual orientation.
   Everyone in our class has the right to be addressed in accordance with their personal
   identity. I will gladly address you by the name and gender pronoun with which you
   identify. Please let me know your preferred name and pronouns early in the semester, so
   your peers and I can address you appropriately.
   We may sometimes disagree with one another about a particular reading, but think about
   how your comments will support our learning as a group. Challenging another person’s
   beliefs and ideas is part of a productive learning space, but we need to make sure we can
   do this without belittling any given perspective. Be sure to challenge colleagues to explain
   their arguments in a thoughtful manner so that we can create an engaging learning
   community together.
k) Scholastic Honesty: Turning in work that is not your own, or any other form of
   scholastic dishonesty, will result in a major course penalty, possibly failure of the course.
   This standard applies to all drafts and assignments, and a report of the incident will be
   submitted to the Office of the Dean of Students and filed in your permanent UT record.
   Under certain circumstances, the Dean of Students will initiate proceedings to expel you
   from the University. So, take care to read and understand the Statement on Scholastic
   Responsibility, which can be found online at
   http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/rhetoric/firstyearwriting/plagiarismcollusion.php If
                                                                                                 5


       you have any doubts about your use of sources, ask your instructor for help before handing
       in the assignment.
