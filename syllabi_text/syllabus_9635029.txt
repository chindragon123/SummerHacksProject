Description: From the days when MTV actually played music in the 1980s and 90s to the era of YouTube and online viral sensations,
the music video has been a beloved fixture of popular culture for more than thirty-five years. Less well known is the genre’s deep
connection with and indebtedness to the world of short-form filmmaking and the cinema proper, with upstart auteurs like Spike
Jonze, David Fincher, and Mark Romanek and even Hollywood heavyweights like Martin Scorsese all working in the form at various
points in their careers. In this course, we will explore the history of the music video as a genre of short-form cinema, focusing on the
work of key music video directors set in the context of their other work in short and feature filmmaking. Focused in its first half on
introducing and theorizing the work of select music video directors from the 1980s to the present, the course will turn in its second
half to a series of independent, student-led research investigations into select topics and figures in the history of music videos,
culminating in the preparation of a research project and in-class presentation. Key directors to be examined in class include Spike
Jonze, David Fincher, Mark Romanek, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, Michael Gondry, Antoine Fuqua, Tarsem Singh, and Martin
Scorsese. Music videos covered will include those featuring Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, George Michael, Dire Straits, Bjork,
R.E.M., Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Weezer, The Beastie Boys, Fatboy Slim, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Beyonce, and Arcade Fire.

Policies:
Documented Disability Statement: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations
for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or
232-2937 (video phone), or visit http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd.
Honor Code: The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust,
fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Academic Integrity: Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. For
additional information on Academic Integrity, see http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint.php.
Religious Holy Days: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of a pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a
religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Class Attendance and Lateness Policy: You are expected to attend all scheduled classes and arrive on time. In the event you must
miss a class, you can do so on 3 instances without it affecting your final grade; these 3 missed classes do not need to be excused.
Beyond these 3 classes, all absences must be excused. Reasons for excused absences include illness (with doctor’s note), team
sports or approved activities, and family emergencies. Any unexcused absences beyond the allowed 3 missed classes will lower your
final class grade by 1/3 of a letter. (This does not include Religious Holy Days.) Three late arrivals will count as one absence.
Late Assignments Policy: Assignments are due at the start of class on the dates listed in the Schedule unless otherwise rescheduled
by the instructor. If you are absent on the day that an assignment is due, you must submit it via email by class time on that day for it
not to be considered late. Unless arrangements for an extension are made in advance with the instructor, late assignments will be
marked down 1/3 of a letter for every day they are late.
Flag Statement:
Independent Inquiry: This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are designed to engage you in
the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing you with the opportunity for independent investigation of a question,
problem, or project related to your major. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from the
independent investigation and presentation of your own work.
Writing: This course carries the Writing Flag. Writing Flag courses are designed to give students experience with writing in an
academic discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete substantial writing projects, and
receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise one or more
assignments, and you may be asked to read and discuss your peers’ work. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your
grade to come from your written work. Writing Flag classes meet the Core Communications objectives of Critical Thinking,
Communication, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility, established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
Web Site: A Canvas site will be available for this course.
