COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course examines the powerful, contested, and endlessly debated concept of sustainable development.
“Sustainability” has come to mean many things to many different entities. Most identify it through the
trifecta of environmental protection, economic equality, and social justice. Similarly, the term
“development” carries its own complex and contested meaning. Despite these contestations, sustainable
development continues to be the key idea around which various notions of development are structured
today. While many sustainable development courses take the economy as a starting point, emphasizing
economic notions of development, we will depart from this convention, and instead reflect on
environmental protections, social justice issues, as well as economic structures and cultures that present
both barriers to and opportunities for sustainable development. Please note, this course is not an
international development course. Further, the course is also not a guidebook for how to construct
sustainable development. We will critically examine the concept of sustainable development, and also
note circumstances when communities are empowered to achieve sustainable development on their own
terms.
COURSE FORMAT:
This course will be conducted at an advanced undergraduate level primarily through lecture. That said,
given our class size, and the contested topics for investigation, I expect class discussions to be a critical
component of the learning process. While there are designated days set forth for discussion, I anticipate
conversations to spring up organically. You should be prepared each class day having read the reading and
prepared to speak about it – be it to question concepts that were not fully understood, or to interrogate the
claims of the authors in a critical fashion.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
Students will be able to (1) analyze scholarly literature pertaining to sustainable development and human-
environment interactions, (2) evaluate the economic and social drivers of environmental degradation, (3)
critically analyze scientific articles, (4) lead thoughtful discussion on contentious issues, (5) practice oral
presentation skills, and (6) evaluate policy aimed at advancing sustainable development.
READINGS/TEXTBOOK:
There is no textbook for this course. All articles and chapters will be posted on Canvas. See bibliography
below. All readings should be completed before class. Any changes will be announced in class and over
email.

Assignments
20% Participation
15% Quiz
25% Exam
20% Discussion Preparation & Lead
20% ‘My Sustainable Life’ Commodity Chain
Participation I expect that each student regularly attends lectures and is prepared to engage in discussion over
the readings (see University rules regarding attendance below). Periodically we will have in class activities, which
you will submit upon leaving the classroom for that day. Participation also hinges on your contributions to six
designated discussion sessions.


 Quiz/Exam One quiz and one exam will take place over the course of the term. They are scheduled for July 19, &
 August 8/9. More direction regarding the nature of each will be provided prior to the test.
 Discussion Preparation & Lead: You will present twice to a smaller group within the class. The idea is to lead
 your group in a discussion (not lecture) based on relevant questions and themes raised in the readings, lectures
 and outside experiences. Following the discussion, you will submit your materials and a few reflection paragraphs
 by midnight the day you lead the discussion. This consists of your slides (background research, and questions
 asked), and your reflection on the success of your approach and opinions discussed and record the attendance of
 discussants. You must be in class July 17th to get your group assignment.
 My Sustainable Life This assignment will have you trace the global production patterns associated with common
 commodities you purchase. More direction will be provided in the first few weeks of class. The assignment is due
 on Sunday August 11th.
 Grading System: Final letter marks are determined through the following scheme:
 A:     100 – 92%         B+: 89.99% - 88%        C+: 79.99% - 78%        D+: 69.99% - 68%
 A -: 91.99 – 90%         B: 87.99% - 82%         C: 77.99% - 72%         D: 67.99% - 62%
                          B-: 81.99% - 80%        C-: 71.99% - 70%        D-: 61.99% - 60%      F – Below 60%
