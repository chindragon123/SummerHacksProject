Description: Program Dates: Independent study May 10th-June 8th, at Winedale on June 8th, on
tour beginning on August 13th, returning August 27th. Shakespeare at Winedale is a course
dedicated to the study of Shakespeare's plays through performance. This course offers an
educational and theatrical experience of great intensity, as well as a unique opportunity for group
interaction and self-exploration, to students from any discipline. The program is open to students of all
majors. The first part of the course (four weeks) is an individual study, correspondence, conference
course (E f678SA) preparing the student through reading of the texts, source materials, scholarship,
and criticism. The second part of the course (E s678SB) is taken in residence at the 250-acre
University of Texas Winedale Historical Center, near Round Top, Texas. For nine weeks, students
study Shakespeare 15-18 hours a day, seven days a week, in the 1880s Theatre Barn. The summer
concludes with 24 public performances of the plays studied, followed by a two-week touring
opportunity to study and perform on a variety of stages, including the Blackfriars Theatre at the
American Shakespeare Center in Virginia.
Texts:
Edited copies of the three summer plays (course packet):
        The Comedy of Errors
        Macbeth
        Richard II
Recommended:
        The Complete Works of Shakespeare. In addition to the summer plays, we will read others
               relevant to them.
Requirements & Grading: Grades will be based on level of participation, contributions to the group
experience, and above all, the ability to learn and teach through performance. In the independent
study phase of the course, and occasionally during the summer, there will be a series of short written
assignments. The grade for 678A will take into account the student’s participation in the email
discussion list as well as preparation, including knowledge of lines, upon arrival at Winedale. The
course will test every aspect of the student's interaction with Shakespeare, demanding close critical
reading, discussion and written analysis, and rigorous, creative exploration of the text in performance.
I will use plus and minus grades.
Schedule:
May 10-June 8          Independent study. Students will read, comment on, and answer questions
about the four summer plays, along with several secondary texts on Shakespearean performance.
All students will participate in a listserv discussion group, making regular entries, responding to


questions by the instructor, and preparing a short research project. The listserv discussion and role
preparation are an important component of the grade for E678A.
May 19        Roles assigned. Each student will be cast in each play; all will receive an approximately
equal number of lines (300 to 500) across the three plays. It is essential that all lines be learned,
fully and accurately, before the class convenes at Winedale June 9.
June 8                Meeting at Winedale.
June 9                Preparation of theatre barn and classrooms. Reading of Love’s Labour’s Lost.
June 9-15     The Comedy of Errors. For each of the first three weeks we will focus on one of the
plays. We will begin on the first day with a read-through under the pecan trees, then work through,
doing approximately one act per day. By the Saturday night (Friday in the case of Macbeth) we will be
ready to give a full dress performance of the play for an invited audience, with at least provisional
versions of all costumes, music, props, etc.
