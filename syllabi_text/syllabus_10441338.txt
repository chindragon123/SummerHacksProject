Description: From the days when MTV actually played music in the 1980s and 90s to the era of YouTube and online viral sensations,
the music video has been a beloved fixture of popular culture for more than thirty-five years. Less well known is the genre’s deep
connection with and indebtedness to the world of short-form filmmaking and the cinema proper, with upstart auteurs like Spike
Jonze, David Fincher, and Mark Romanek and even Hollywood heavyweights like Martin Scorsese all working in the form at various
points in their careers. In this course, we will explore the history of the music video as a genre of short-form cinema, focusing on the
work of key music video directors set in the context of their other work in short and feature filmmaking. Focused in its first half on
introducing and theorizing the work of select music video directors from the 1980s to the present, the course will turn in its second
half to a series of independent, student-led research investigations into select topics and figures in the history of music videos,
culminating in the preparation of a research project and in-class presentation. Key directors to be examined in class include Spike
Jonze, David Fincher, Mark Romanek, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, Michael Gondry, Antoine Fuqua, Tarsem Singh, and Martin
Scorsese. Music videos covered will include those featuring Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, George Michael, Dire Straits, Bjork,
R.E.M., Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Weezer, The Beastie Boys, Fatboy Slim, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Beyonce, and Arcade Fire.
Texts: Sound and Vision: The Music Video Reader, ed. Simon Frith, Andrew Goodwin, and Lawrence Grossberg (Routledge, 1993).
