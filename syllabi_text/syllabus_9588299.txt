Course Description
Ever since film was introduced into China at the end of the nineteenth century, it has become a
major medium of mass communication, and has played an important role in China’s quest for
modernity. Despite warfare, censorship, competition from Hollywood, and other obstacles
witnessed over the course of one hundred years of development, today the Chinese film industry
is one of the most vibrant in the world. This course introduces major developments and genres
since 1980 by presenting representative films from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
Students will study Chinese films both as a unique form of artistic expression, and as a vehicle
for powerful social and political discourse. All films have English subtitles. No knowledge of
Chinese language will be necessary.
Learning Objectives
       Introducing the general history of Chinese cinema which spans over one hundred years
       Presenting major developmental milestones in the development of Chinese cinema since
        1980
       Presenting major genres of filmmaking in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan
       Illuminating the relationship between aesthetic conventions and socioeconomic
        development
       Highlighting the interconnections of the film cultures between the three Chinese societies
       Presenting the interaction between Hollywood and Chinese cinema in terms of marketing,
        production, and stars
