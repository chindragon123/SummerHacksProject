Course Description
Construction IV (ARC 435) is largely a continuation of the content from the previous construction sequence courses, with a shift into
larger structures and systems. The course focuses on the integration of technical and tectonic issues into the design process, in order to
gain an understanding of methods in which structure as well as other technical aspects of contemporary buildings can be used as a
driver or at least a factor in design process to create more intelligent and innovative spaces, rather than an afterthought which
compromises design intent.
Structure can be defined as a building’s load-bearing mechanism which keeps it standing upright upon the ground, but structure can
also be defined as an overall ordering system, or as an arrangement or interrelationship of components, both tangible and intangible. The
course aims to examine ways in which large scale structural and construction techniques influence architectural design, and vice-versa,
as well as how the pedagogy of construction positions itself within contemporary practice.
Qualitative and quantitative analyses are both employed to understand building constructive logic as well as calculations which examine
the forces imparted upon structures in various conditions. By obtaining a stronger understanding of a building’s structural and tectonic
behavior, students will acquire new tools by which to innovate in the design process. Structural calculations are examined as a way to
gain a basic understanding of the field of engineering, to allow for better architect/engineer collaboration throughout an architect’s career,
as well as to better prepare students for licensure exams (ARE). In addition to understanding structural behavior abstractly, the course
will examine historical and especially contemporary case study buildings which employ intelligent designs by taking on structural and
tectonic issues in innovative ways.

Format
-Lectures will cover the significant material introduced in the required reading assignments.
-Homework assignments will be issued most weeks and will be due the following week, in class, after the student has had the
opportunity to attend the lab sessions which will review example problems similar in nature to those assignments. Late homework will
not be accepted.
-In addition to the weekly assignments, constructed projects will constitute the fundamental coursework.
-Homework problems will be accomplished in groups of 3 or less. Any individual not performing a commensurate share of the work may
be eliminated from the group but is still responsible to satisfy all homework requirements.
-Projects, on the other hand, will be required to be completed by each individual student unless noted otherwise.
-Quizzes may be given without notice and may cover reading assignments and/or any material presented in any prior and/or current
lectures. The format of the quizzes, either open or closed book, will be determined by the instructor at the time of the quiz.
-Exams will be closed book and may extract any information from all lectures, labs, and reading assignments within a given period
determined by the instructor.
Skills & Experience Flag
This course carries a flag for Quantitative Reasoning, as administered by the Center for Skills Experience Flags in the Undergraduate
Studies program at The University of Texas at Austin.
The Quantitative Reason Flag indicates that the course is designed to equip students with skills that are necessary for understanding the
types of quantitative arguments expected to be encountered in a young professional life. Students should therefore expect a portion of
their grade to be come from the use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.

Attendance:
Most class meetings will be devoted to lectures on key course content, so regular attendance and active participation are imp ortant. You may miss three
classes and/or lab sessions – for any reason – without penalty. Each additional absence will lower your grade by 5%. Six or more absences will likely
result in a failing grade for the course. Because our time in class is limited, promptness is important, and you may be count ed absent if you are late to
class. Please contact the teaching assistants if you expect to be late or miss class, or as soon as reasonably possible in the case of a medical
emergency.
Absence for military service:
In accordance with section 51.9111 of the Texas Education Code, a student is excused from attending classes or engaging in other required activities,
including exams, if he or she is called to active military service of a reasonably brief duration. The maximum time for which the student may be excused
has been defined by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board as “no more than 25 percent of the total number of class meeting or the contact hour
equivalent (not including the final examination period) for [a course] at the beginning of the period of active military service.” The student will be allowed a
reasonable time after the absence to complete assignments and take exams.
A student who misses classes or other required activities for the observance of a religious holiday should inform the teaching assistants as far in
advance of the absence as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable time after the absence.
