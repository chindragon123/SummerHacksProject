         In this course we will study the daily life of people in Mesoamerica. We will examine
production strategies, agriculture, cooking, household life, burial practices, beautification, the
life of children, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and many other aspects of daily life. We will pay
close attention to variation and continuities through space and time in Mesoamerica, and
between different Mesoamerican cultures. We will study a variety of archaeological sites
ranging from the small rural site of Chan in Belize, to the giant city of Teotihuacan in Mexico,
from Joya del Cerén (buried in volcanic ash) to Tenochtitlan (buried under modern Mexico City),
and many others. While we will study daily life as a worthy object of study in and of itself, we
will also examine the relationship between daily life and broad political and economic patterns,
including the formation of ranked societies, warfare, and empire-building.
Goals of the course:
1.       To provide an introduction to daily life in ancient Mesoamerica.
2.       To increase student literacy in archaeology by creating an understanding of how
         archaeological evidence and theory are used in building models about life in the past.
3.       To learn about the role of material culture in everyday life, the economy, and politics in
         ancient Mesoamerica.
Global Cultures flag: This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are
designed to increase your familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should
therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the
practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present. (Copied
from https://ugs.utexas.edu/flags/faculty-resources/teaching/syllabus).
Students with disabilities: Any student with disabilities should talk to me as soon as possible so
that we may make arrangements that will make for a better learning experience and that will
allow all students to show their abilities fully.
Classroom rules:
1.       NO cellphones, laptops, newspapers, or calculators in class or during exams. I mean it.
2.       You may not record lectures or take photographs during lecture. Recording of any of my
                                                                                                    1


         lectures will be considered academic dishonesty and result in academic penalties for the
         students involved.
3.       Academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to University rules. We will talk about
         issues related to academic dishonesty in class.
Grading and other class policies: Successful completion of this course will require learning from
readings, lectures, Power Point presentations, in-class exercises, and film. Topics covered in the
readings and in the classroom will, at times, be entirely different. Graded materials for this
class consist of a short paper, an in-class presentation of your short paper, and three non-
cumulative exams. In addition, I will take attendance during the in-class presentations, and
attendance will be graded. I will provide instructions for the short paper early during the
semester.
         Due to privacy concerns, I will not give grades to students over the phone or via email.
         Students may discuss their exams with me individually. Students who request that I re-
grade their exams must present their request in writing. If I agree to re-grade their exam,
students should be aware that their grade might suffer if I find errors that I did not find on my
first grading. Therefore, students are advised to make sure they have specific reasons why their
grade should improve before they challenge their grade.
         I do not post lecture notes on the Internet. I may post PowerPoint presentations on
Canvas.
Final grades will be calculated as follows:
1.       Short paper (3 to 4 pages long):        10%
2.       In-class presentation:                  10%
3.       Attendance during presentations:        10%
4.       Exam 1:                                 20%
5.       Exam 2:                                 25%
6.       Exam 3 (non-cumulative):                25%
Textbooks and other readings:
1.       There are no texbooks to buy for this class. I will make electronic copies of all the
         readings available.
2.       There will be several readings posted on Canvas, and they are required. You may find
         them in the Files section of this class on canvas. The file name will have the author’s last
         name first.
                                                                                                    2


Email rules:
1.     Email if you have a medical emergency that will prevent you from making it to an exam.
       No need to email if you will miss class, unless you miss more than two weeks of class
       due to a major emergency.
2.     Email me if you need to see me in office hours but you have a time conflict with a class.
       I will be glad to make an appointment. Otherwise, you may just show up during office
       hours.
3.     Email if I ask you to email me.
4.     Do not email to continue class discussion; please use office hours. Also, if you have a
       question about the material, please bring it up in class. Other students might benefit
       from it.
5.     Do not use email to turn in assignments or to send attachments unless I specifically ask
       you to do so.
