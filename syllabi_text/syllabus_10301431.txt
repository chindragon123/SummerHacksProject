Course Description: This class will familiarize the student with the main works of ancient
historiography, as well as provide grounding in the central issues with which these works engage.
The ancient historians are our first port of call in our quest to understand democracy, tyranny,
empire, religion, civil war, and international relations, so it is to these foundational texts that we
will turn to enliven our connection with the ancient world. Beyond acquiring basic knowledge of
each of the historians and their text, we will explore issues such as: the development and coherence
of a historiographical tradition, the value of textual material as historical evidence, the status of
prose historiography as an independent work of literary art, and the function of historiography as
a space to explore broader questions such as truth, identity, nationalism, ethnicity, and political
ideologies. We will conclude by thinking about the unique qualities of historiography, and what
distinguishes it from related genres such as biography, historical epic, or historical novels.
        The course also carries the Ethics flag, so we will use the tradition of classical
historiography in order to consider four related questions: 1) What is the relationship between
political regimes and ethical behavior? 2) How can we use historiography, and indeed, history, to
construct and examine ethical behaviors, assumptions, and actions? 3) What is the relationship
between theory and practice? That is, between how historians describe the past and the lessons
they mean for the reader to employ? 4) What limitations do context and form place on ethical
choices, and in consequence, how can the lessons of history be refined for present day needs.
Required Texts: These can all be purchased online, but I have not made an order at the Co-op.
Bear in mind that you need the Landmark Herodotus straightaway, but you have a week to obtain
the rest. You may if you wish use other versions of these texts, but the schedule of readings
coordinates page numbers for these editions. If you want to invest in a newer text, both Penguin
Classics and Oxford World Classics are good and affordable choices, and the University’s library
has a full range of them to check out.
Strassler, R. 2009. Landmark Herodotus. Anchor Press.
Strassler, R. 2008. Landmark Thucydides. Free Press; Revised edition.
Mellor, R. 2004. The Historians of Ancient Rome. Routledge; 2 edition.
Readings not included in these books (marked ** on the Schedule of Readings) will be available
on the class Canvas site or on electronic reserves.
Assessment: In addition to the regular readings, attendance, and participation (10%), your final
grade will be assessed as follows: 1) Two (2) short papers (750 words) (listed under Important
Dates) (2*15=) 15%; 2) Quizzes 10%; 3) One 2,000 word paper 30%; 4) Final Exam (20%). I will


give further details in class—please ask me if you have questions about any of these assignments,
whether relating to content or format. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.
The grade scale used for this class is as follows: A+ (100-96), A (95-93), A- (92-90), B+ (89-86),
B (86-83), B- (82-80), C+ (79-76), C (75-73), C- (72-70), D+ (69-66), D (66-63), D- (62-60).
Grades below 60 will be assigned an F.
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Any student caught cheating or facilitating cheating in
any assignment or quiz will receive an F for the class and will be referred to the appropriate dean.
If you are not certain what constitute dishonesty, please consult the university’s website
(http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php) or ask me. All work must be your own; no
group projects are allowed, and any joint work will be considered cheating.
Expectations: This is mainly a lecture course, supplemented by discussion. The workload is
approx. 50-75 pages of reading per meeting on average. Students are expected to attend all classes
and to complete all assigned readings before class as well as all other assignments by the relevant
deadline. This class also places an emphasis on the development of writing skills – your
assignments are designed to give you repeated opportunities to improve your critical idiom and
expression before the final paper.
You are expected to arrive on time and remain for the entire duration of the class. Failure to do so
will negatively affect your grade! I will give several unannounced quizzes in class, and those will
count for 10% of your grade. These quizzes cannot be made up, except in case of a documented
athletic commitment, medical problem or religious observances, all of which must be approved by
me at least 14 days in advance, or by a doctor’s note in the case of a medical emergency. You will
have to make up quizzes no later than one week after the regular date, or else receive a zero
regardless of the reason. Three missed quizzes will result in an F grade.
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division
of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, at 471-6259,
471-4641 TTY, http://www.utexas.edu/disability/; you must schedule an appointment with me to
discuss these accommodations not later than the second week of class.
Written assignments are due in my office on the due date by 5:00pm; the Final Paper is due May
13th by 10:00pm. All papers should have a title and your name on them, and be edited and proof-
read; if you submit a paper copy (preferred), print on both sides of the page; if you submit
electronically, make sure you name is on the paper as well as the file! Late work will be penalized
by 1/3 of a letter grade (e.g., from A to A-) for every day late, unless approved by me in advance,
and subject to the same exceptions and restrictions on making up quizzes.
A Word to the Wise: it is in your own interest to manage time well. You certainly want to be
thinking about your paper topics straightaway, and start writing them well in advance of the
deadline. Likewise, if you get through most of the week’s readings on the weekend prior, your life
will be much easier. I expect engaged students and thoughtful, proof-read papers. This is much
easier to accomplish if you give yourself time to process, and budget for all other distractions.
