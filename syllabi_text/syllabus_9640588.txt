  What does it take to get a letter of recommendation?
  Rather than taking requests, I prefer to make offers to write LORs for students whom I have gotten to know
  well, and who demonstrate scholarship, leadership, and service while in 365s! These are demonstrated by
  excellent exam performance, answering and asking questions in class, facilitating homework sessions,
  tutoring other students . . .
   What else do I need to know?
   ACCOMMODATIONS: Accommodations will be made for qualified students with disabilities. If you need
   extra time or low distraction on exams, we recommend that you make reservations with SSD. If it is
   possible for me to proctor an extended exam between class and the regular exam time, I will be happy to
   do so, but it is not always possible.
   DROP DATE: The last day to Q drop the course except for urgent non- academic reasons is Tues June 11,
   2019. After this, students may go to the Dean’s office, WCH 1.112, to appeal for non-academic reasons.
   The last day to change to pass/fail is Wed June 26, 2019.
   RELIGIOUS HOLY DAYS: It is the policy of The University of Texas at Austin that the student must notify
   the instructor at least fourteen days prior to a scheduled class day that s/he will be absent to observe a
   religious holy day. For religious holidays that fall within the first two weeks of the semester, the notice
   should be given on the first day of the semester. For the purposes of grading in this course, such days
   will qualify as excused absences.
   USE OF CLASS MATERIALS: The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes,
   and homework assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the class
   materials is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the
   student. The sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the instructor may be a
   violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which could result in
   further disciplinary action. This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for
   the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students.
