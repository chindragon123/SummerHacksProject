                                        recommendations.
   This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning Flag. QR courses are designed to equip you with skills that
   are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments you will regularly encounter in your
   adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from
   your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
 Assessment
   Course grades will be determined using the following assignments and weights:
                Two (non-cumulative) Midterm Exams
                    Lower midterm grade                   15%
                    Higher midterm grade                  25%
                Final Exam (cumulative)                   30%
                Two Case Quizzes                           5%
                Attendance                                15%
                Homework (Connect) Review Prob.           10%
                                                        100%
   The BBA Program recommends a mean GPA of 3.0-3.2 for this course, but the actual grades assigned will
   be based on what you earn. All sections of ACC 312 follow the same grading policy, and you may assess
   your performance based on the traditional grade cutoffs of 90% = A-, 80% = B-, 70% = C-, 60% = D-, and
   below 60% = F. There will be no opportunity to raise your course grade by doing "extra credit" work either
   before or after the end of the semester. Incompletes will be given only in the rarest of circumstances and
   according to university policy.
   Grade Appeals: If you feel there exists a grading error on any of the exams, quizzes, attendance, or
   homework, or if you feel you need to bring to my attention other facts or circumstances that might affect the
   grade for an exam, quiz, attendance, or homework, you must appeal within one week from the date the
   item is graded to take such action and have the matter resolved. The one-week period will begin on the
   day the grade is posted to Canvas or Connect. My TA does NOT handle grade appeals, only I do in
   person and in my office. Please do not wait until the end of the semester once you realize you may need
   additional points to take this action (unfortunately by then it will be too late).
   Be aware, however, that grading errors can occur in both directions, errors can make grades top high as
   well as too low. Therefore, if you request a regrading, your entire exam will be re-graded, and all grading
   errors will be corrected. By requesting a re-grade, you accept the possibility that your grade may go either
   up or down.
Exams
   Exams are individual work; no collaboration of any kind is allowed. There will be two non-cumulative
   midterm exams. Midterm exams will be closed book/notes and will be held on the dates and times
   indicated in the Class Schedule. All students in all sections of ACC 312 will take the exams at the same
   time. Calculators that are programmable or can store text are NOT allowed for exams and will be
   confiscated.
   There will be a common, cumulative final exam given for all sections of ACC 312 at the end of the term.
   The final exam will be closed book/notes and we will advise you of the date for the final exam as soon as
   we receive it. Do not make travel arrangements until you are certain of your exam schedule! Anyone with a
       Fall 2019                                 Syllabus – ACC 312                                Page 2


    non-standard exam schedule (SSD or other approved exception) MUST make exam arrangements with me
    at least one week in advance, and before making any travel arrangements. No early exams will be given
    FOR ANY REASON, including to accommodate travel schedules.
    Alternate exams: If you have another UT class or UT exam at the same time as one of the midterm exams,
    an alternate exam will be given, generally on the day after the scheduled exam. Similarly, if you have
    another UT final exam that directly conflicts with our scheduled final exam, there is a provision for an
    alternate exam. However, in all cases permission to take an alternate exam is at my discretion and the
    request must be made at least one week in advance. Note that conflicts such as classes at other
    educational institutions and work schedules will not constitute an acceptable reason to take an alternate
    exam. If you also have a class or exam conflict with the alternate midterm exam, we can, with my prior
    approval, make arrangements for you to make up the exam. Individual makeup midterm exams must be
    taken within 72 hours of the original exam date. These exams will be given at the Testing Center located
    on the fifth floor of the McCombs School, and I will work with you to schedule it. If you do not take the
    makeup exam as scheduled, you will receive a 0 on the exam.
    If you miss an exam due to a severe illness or other emergency, you should notify me before the exam, if
    possible, and you must provide prompt notification and proof of emergency to Student Emergency Services
    (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/). They will require proof of emergency and will provide me
    official acknowledgement of the emergency. However, I have final authority to determine if your absence is
    excused. If so, and if it is feasible for you to take the scheduled alternate exam or an individual makeup
    midterm exam (see prior paragraph), you may do so. Otherwise, students with an excused absence from a
    midterm exam will be required to add the weight of that exam (“lowest midterm” weight) to the weight of the
    final exam. Unexcused absences will result in an exam grade of 0.
Case Quizzes/Assignments
    We will discuss two cases during the course to provide context and additional dimensions to the concepts
    we are studying. We will spend the class addressing the case on the day indicated in the Course
    Schedule, so coming to class well prepared is critical. Read the case carefully and think about the answers
    to the questions in the case. These answers will not be handed in. Each case class will begin with a 5-10
    minute closed-packet quiz on the case. Students who leave class after the quiz and therefore don’t
    participate in the case discussion, will receive a zero for that case quiz grade.
    No make-up case quizzes will be given, however in the event of a pre-excused absence, you may avoid a
    0 by submitting a five-page paper (double spaced, 12-pt Times Roman font, 1” margins, due within one
    week) addressing a topic of my choosing. The same policy for severe illness or other emergency in the
    Exams section applies to this section also.
Attendance
    I will take attendance every class except four class days (August 28/29, September 3/4, November 11/12,
    December 4/5). Starting with your third absence, you will get 1% deducted from your course grade up to a
    maximum of 15%. In order to get credit for being “in attendance” you must be present, prepared, and
    engaged. This includes, but is not limited to, having the class notes with you or taking class notes.
    Students must attend the class section they are officially registered in, unless prior arrangements have
    been made with me.
    This policy is in place as there is a strong, albeit obvious, link between taking part in active learning and
    doing well and mastering the material. Please note there is no distinction between “excused” and
    “unexcused” absences in this section. Please save your absences for when you really need them!
    In extreme situations (such as hospitalization, severe illness, death of an immediate family member) I may,
    in my discretion, excuse other absences after consultation with Student Emergency Services
         Fall 2019                                 Syllabus – ACC 312                                   Page 3


    (http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/). Minor illness, job interviews, vacation plans, etc. are NOT
    “extreme situations”.
Homework (done in Connect)
    Homework must be completed individually in Connect. Each week, Review Problems covering that
    week’s class material will be due to be submitted in Connect. The Course Schedule lists these problems.
    The Review Problems grade is the percent of all points on Review Problems that are correct as submitted.
    Your answers to these problems must be submitted in Connect by 5:00 p.m. on Saturday of that week. A
    solution will be provided in Connect after the submission window ends.
    Late homework will not be accepted. Also, note that for most questions, Connect will change the numbers
    in the problem for each student, so your data will differ from the textbook and your solution will not be
    identical to your classmates’ solutions. Connect will grade these questions, provide solutions to Review
    Problems, and indicate areas where you need to do additional study.
    If you have difficulty using Connect or encounter a problem with the technology, you might need to contact
    the Connect Help Desk (click Help from within Connect). If you have questions about how to solve the
    exercises or problems, please use the Discussion Board on Canvas, see the TAs during their office hours,
    or come see me during my office hours.
    Please note that no homework assignments will be dropped. However, we have configured Connect to
    allow you multiple opportunities to check your work on Review Problems prior to submission. So, you have
    ample opportunity to do well on homework assignments.
Other Assignments
    Other graded work may also be assigned, depending on my assessment of class progress and
    preparation. Examples would include (but are not limited to) quizzes in Canvas, extra problem
    assignments, extra case work, and in-class check questions. If I choose to make such assignments, their
    scores will be treated as part of the case quiz grades and/or attendance.
Copyright
Use of Class Materials - the materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, exams, quizzes, class
notes, and homework assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the class
materials is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the
student. Additionally, the sharing of class materials (including, but not limited to, fraternity/sorority or other
group or individual test banks, Facebook/Slack pages, etc.) without the specific, express approval of the
instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty, which
could result in further disciplinary action. This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to
websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students (examples – Couse
Hero, Facebook/Slack pages, etc.).
Class Recordings - Electronic Class Recordings are Prohibited without my express consent - with the
exception of the students who are permitted to do so as part of a reasonable accommodation received by
Services for Students with Disabilities, students may not electronically record class. This prohibition includes
the use of audio and video recordings. If you ask for my express consent to record class and it is given, such
recordings may only be used for your personal educational use and may not be distributed to other
persons. Any student who violates these limitations is subject to discipline under Chapter 11 of the Institutional
Rules. If you need to record a particular class session you must ask me specifically before class.
         Fall 2019                                Syllabus – ACC 312                                    Page 4


 E-mail and Canvas
 The use of e-mail and Canvas is required for this course. I will frequently communicate with the class with
 announcements and guidance via e-mail. I will use the e-mail addresses that are supplied to me on
 Canvas. If you need to update your e-mail address with the University go to your UT Direct page and,
 under personal info/all my addresses, change your e-mail address. Before each class, I will post on
 Canvas our lecture outline notes. I will send out a class-wide e-mail notifying you when I post the lecture
 outline notes so you can print them out and bring them to class.
 Any outside-of-class announcements that I make (e.g., corrections or clarifications of items discussed in
 class, syllabus changes, assignment changes, etc.) will be sent to you via e-mail through Canvas. It is
 possible that substantial content will be posted on Canvas or sent via e-mail. It is your responsibility to
 regularly check your e-mail and the class Canvas site.
Discussion Board on Canvas
 In Canvas under “Discussions” I have created a discussion board to answer questions about course
 content (clarification of class notes, questions about homework problems or practice exam questions, etc.).
 If you have any questions on any of our course content please post them here. Discussion boards, such
 as this, enable all students to get equal access to useful information that comes from students’ questions
 and responses or conversations with professors or TAs. Posts to this discussion board are strongly
 preferred to e-mails. If you wish you can receive an e-mail when posts are added to this discussion board
 by subscribing to the discussion board by clicking on the “ribbon”.
Class Preparation and Success
 You are encouraged to ask questions in class, both to seek technical clarification of points discussed and
 to understand how a particular topic relates to your personal interest in business.
 Class attendance and doing the homework are the two biggest keys to success in this class. Students who
 do well are generally those who attend class regularly and can participate in class discussions because
 they have prepared. Although problems may seem fairly intuitive when we do them in class, you will be
 surprised how hard it is to set them up and solve them on your own. Practice is key.
Classroom Standards
 A 2017 study by McCombs marketing professor Adrian Ward showed that having your phone present
 (even when it’s turned off!) takes up some of your brain power. Other recent studies, see the New York
 Times article later in this syllabus, have shown that using computers in class leads to worse performance.
 So, although you will use your computer extensively for class-related work (Connect homework), during
 class there will be no computer use, and your phone should be turned off and in your bag.
 This classroom is subject to “business meeting” etiquette:
       Silence your phones and no texting or other phone activity during class.
       Be prepared to do calculations in class. Your phone calculator is fine in class, but it will not be
           allowed on the exam so you might do better to practice with a financial calculator. We recommend
           the HP 10bII+ financial calculator because it is (1) also useful for ACC 311 and FIN 357, (2)
           relatively inexpensive (about $35), (3) non-programmable and therefore acceptable for exam use.
       No extraneous conversation or disruptive behavior.
       You should arrive on time. On the rare occasion when you don’t, please enter and set up quietly.
       If you must leave early, please notify me in advance.
 You MUST come to the class section in which you are officially registered, unless you’ve made
 arrangements with me beforehand. Class limits are set to ensure a quality experience for everyone. Also,
 to receive credit for attendance and quizzes you must come to the class section in which you are officially
 registered for.
      Fall 2019                                Syllabus – ACC 312                                 Page 5


     Notification Regarding BBA Recruiting Conflicts
     Conflicts occasionally arise between classes and the search for employment. We understand how
     important the job search process is to you, and McCombs provides many resources in support of career
     exploration and search. However, UT is first and foremost an educational institution and your BBA degree
     will be the credential that certifies your education. As such, education will take precedent whenever such a
     conflict arises.
     All companies that recruit at McCombs are informed of this fact. Should a conflict arise, we recommend
     the following steps:
      Note that a job-related conflict, whether a current job or a potential one, is usually not an acceptable
          reason for missing an exam or taking a make-up, and may not be acceptable in other circumstances
          either. If any doubt exists, check with your professor.
      If no exception is provided, inform the company that an academic conflict exists and request an
          accommodation.
      If no accommodation is provided by the company, and you have done everything within your power to
          resolve the situation, contact BBA Career Services and request their assistance in resolving the
          situation.
     Note that while we do have influence with the companies that recruit at McCombs, not all conflicts can be
     resolved and we have little or no influence with companies that do not recruit through the Recruit McCombs
     system.
     Finally, be aware that it is not unreasonable for an employer to expect you to go to some lengths to show
     your interest in them. In a recent example, several students completed an exam at 9 PM and were
     expected to attend an on-site interview in Houston the next morning at 8 AM. A 5:30 AM flight from Austin
     was available and the students were expected to be on it. This is reasonable, and if you think it is unfair,
     you probably need to reconsider what you believe are the reasonable expectations of a good job and
     career in business.
                                                Important Notifications
Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities may request appropriate academic accommodations from the Division of Diversity
and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259,
http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/.
Diversity and Inclusion
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives will be well served by this course,
that students’ learning needs will be addressed and that the diversity that students bring to this class can be
comfortably expressed and be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. Please let me know right away if
this ever is not the case.
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, or other assignment in order to
observe a religious holy day, and you notify me appropriately, you will be given an opportunity to complete the
missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
In the Assignments section above, you can find specific guidance regarding individual and group work for each
of the evaluation elements in this course.
The McCombs School of Business has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities of
          Fall 2019                                Syllabus – ACC 312                                 Page 6


both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the BBA Program’s
Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty at http://my.mccombs.utexas.edu/BBA/Code-of-Ethics. By teaching this
course, I have agreed to observe all faculty responsibilities described in that document. By enrolling in this
class, you have agreed to observe all student responsibilities described there. If the application of the
Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty to this class or its assignments is unclear to you in any way, it is your
responsibility to ask me for clarification. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are
subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University.
Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to: copying work on tests or assignments, representing
(copying) the work of another person as one’s own or allowing another person to represent your work as their
own, collaborating without authorization with another student during an exam or in preparing academic work,
using or having on your desk unauthorized material or aids to complete a quiz, group exercise, or exam (e.g.,
cheat sheets, solutions, programmable calculators, cell phones, etc.). You should refer to the Student Conduct
and Academic Integrity website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/ to access the official University
policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty as well as further elaboration on what constitutes scholastic
dishonesty.
Since dishonesty harms the individual, all students, the integrity of the University, and the value of our
academic brand, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. All acts of academic dishonesty
receive significant penalties and are reported to Student Judicial Services and attach to your record. This
record is consulted as part of application processes at UT (e.g., study abroad applications) and after (e.g., law
school and MBA applications, which generally require you to provide access to this record). IT’S NOT WORTH
IT!
Campus Safety
Please note the following key recommendations regarding emergency evacuation, provided by the Office of
Campus Safety and Security. More info at: http://preparedness.utexas.edu.

Privacy in Canvas
Information in Canvas is protected by your UTEID login. Please be aware that if I teach multiple sections of this
course I will use a merged Canvas site for all sections. This will allow students in other sections to see that you
are enrolled in the course and send you email from within Canvas. However, they will not actually learn your
email address and no other personal data will be revealed through Canvas. If you have any concerns, please
contact the ITS Help Desk at 512-475-9400 for help removing your name from the view of other students.

             If no specific guidance is provided, do not round to less than four decimal places.
Please make sure your calculator does not round to less than four decimal places (e.g., 0.2078 does not round
to 0.208 or shorter). Four decimal places will be adequate for any homework or exam problems.
Here are the instructions for the recommended HP 10bII+ calculator (if you have a different calculator, check
your manual or search on-line). The default on this calculator is two decimal places, which is too short for
many problems.

BUSINESS DAY
Laptops Are Great. But Not During a Lecture or a Meeting.
By SUSAN DYNARSKI NOV. 22, 2017
Step into any college lecture hall and you are likely to find a sea of students typing away at open, glowing laptops
as the professor speaks. But you won’t see that when I’m teaching. Though I make a few exceptions, I generally ban
electronics, including laptops, in my classes and research seminars.
That may seem extreme. After all, with laptops, students can, in some ways, absorb more from lectures than they
can with just paper and pen. They can download course readings, look up unfamiliar concepts on the fly and create
an accurate, well-organized record of the lecture material. All of that is good.
But a growing body of evidence shows that over all, college students learn less when they use computers or tablets
during lectures. They also tend to earn worse grades. The research is unequivocal: Laptops distract from learning,
both for users and for those around them. It’s not much of a leap to expect that electronics also undermine
learning in high school classrooms or that they hurt productivity in meetings in all kinds of workplaces.
Measuring the effect of laptops on learning is tough. One problem is that students don’t all use laptops the same
way. It might be that dedicated students, who tend to earn high grades, use them more frequently in classes. It
might be that the most distracted students turn to their laptops whenever they are bored. In any case, a simple
comparison of performance may confuse the effect of laptops with the characteristics of the students who choose
to use them. Researchers call this “selection bias.”
Researchers can solve that problem by randomly assigning some students to use laptops. With that approach, the
students who use laptops are comparable in all other ways to those who don’t. In a series of experiments at
Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, students were randomly assigned either laptops
or pen and paper for note-taking at a lecture. Those who had used laptops had substantially worse understanding
of the lecture, as measured by a standardized test, than those who did not.
The researchers hypothesized that, because students can type faster than they can write, the lecturer’s words
flowed right to the students’ typing fingers without stopping in their brains for substantive processing. Students
writing by hand had to process and condense the spoken material simply to enable their pens to keep up with the
lecture. Indeed, the notes of the laptop users more closely resembled transcripts than lecture summaries. The
handwritten versions were more succinct but included the salient issues discussed in the lecture.

Even so, it may seem heavy-handed to ban electronics in the classroom. Most college students are legal adults who
can serve in the armed forces, vote and own property. Why shouldn’t they decide themselves whether to use a
laptop? The strongest argument against allowing that choice is that one student’s use of a laptop harms the
learning of students around them. In a series of lab experiments, researchers at York University
and McMaster University in Canada tested the effect of laptops on students who weren’t using them. Some
students were told to perform small tasks on their laptops unrelated to the lecture, like looking up movie times. As
expected, these students retained less of the lecture material. But what is really interesting is that the learning of
students seated near the laptop users was also negatively affected.
The economic term for such a spillover is a “negative externality,” which occurs when one person’s consumption
harms the well-being of others. The classic negative externality is pollution: A factory burning coal or a car using
gasoline can harm the air and environment for those around it. A laptop can sometimes be a form of visual
pollution: Those nearby see its screen, and their attention is pulled toward its enticements, which often include not
just note-taking but Facebook, Twitter, email and news.
These experiments go only so far. They may not capture positive effects of laptops in real classrooms over the
course of a semester, when students use their typed notes for review and grades are at stake. But another study
did just that. At the United States Military Academy, a team of professors studied laptop use in an introductory
economics class. The course was taught in small sections, which the researchers randomly assigned to one of three
conditions: electronics allowed, electronics banned and tablets allowed but only if laid flat on desks, where
professors could monitor their use. By the end of the semester, students in the classrooms with laptops or tablets
had performed substantially worse than those in the sections where electronics were banned.
You might question whether the experience of military cadets learning economics is relevant to students in other
settings — say, community college students learning Shakespeare. But we’d expect the negative effects of laptops
to be, if anything, less at West Point, where all courses are taught in small sections, than it is at institutions with
many large lectures. Further, cadets have very strong incentives to perform well and avoid distractions, since class
rank has a major impact on their job status after graduation.
The best way to settle this question is probably to study laptop use in more colleges. But until then, I find the
evidence sufficiently compelling that I’ve made my decision: I ban electronics in my own classes. I do make one
major exception. Students with learning disabilities may use electronics in order to participate in class. This does
reveal that any student using electronics has a learning disability. That is a loss of privacy for those students, which
also occurs when they are given more time to complete a test. Those negatives must be weighed against the
learning losses of other students when laptops are used in class.
Students may object that a laptop ban prevents them from storing notes on their computers. But smartphones can
snap pictures of handwritten pages and convert them to an electronic format. Even better, outside class, students
can read their own handwritten notes and type them, if they like, a process that enhances learning.
The best evidence available now suggests that students should avoid laptops during lectures and just pick up their
pens. It’s not a leap to think that the same holds for middle and high school classrooms, as well as for workplace
meetings.
