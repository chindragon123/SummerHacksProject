There will be 3 non-cumulative tests throughout the summer session that must be taken at the designated
times. There is no final exam. This course follows the Central Daylight Time (CDT). If you are outside
this time zone, you are responsible for ensuring deadlines are met accordingly. There will be no makeups,
with the exception of Test 3 and only on the condition that there is a scheduling conflict with another final
exam, in which case you must provide proper documentation to the instructor. Here are the test dates:

IMPORTANT! Quality is always more important than quantity. If your language is concise, effective,
and thorough, you will receive a higher grade than language that is verbose, ambiguous, and incomplete.
Please do not repeat variations of the same statement just to fill space.
Also, I understand that you only have a limited amount of time to think about and write these responses.
However, while certainly not as important as the content, mechanics can play a part in your grade.
Organization will play a larger role in your essay response than your short answer responses, since you
are asked to include an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.
While you are allowed to consult your notes during the test, please keep in mind that these questions are
designed to take up the full hour. You may find that spending time searching through your notes is too
much time wasted instead of using those precious minutes towards thinking and writing. Also keep in
mind that while this is open-notes, it is NOT open-book and you may NOT use outside sources. Whether
you take your notes digitally or on paper does not matter. You may consult either so long as they are
yours and yours alone. Please refer to the section in the syllabus on Academic Honesty should you have
questions on plagiarism, cheating, or collusion.
Please be mindful of the clock, and budget your time wisely. The test will close precisely at the
designated time. Whatever response you had written prior to that point will be auto-saved on Canvas. I
will not accept emails after the test with fuller and more complete responses.
