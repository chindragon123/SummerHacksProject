Course Description:
                                                                                                                               Fra Angelico (?),
                                                                                                                               Thebaid, tempera
                                                                                                                               on panel, Uffizi,
                                                                                                                                   Florence
  “Midway in our life's journey, I went astray from the straight road and woke to find myself alone in a dark wood”
                                                      ----Dante, Inferno, Canto I 1-3 (transl. John Ciardi), c. 1310
  “Give me my scallop-shell of quiet, my staff of faith to walk upon, my scrip of joy, immortal diet, my bottle of salvation, my gown of glory, hope’s
  true
           gage, and thus I’ll take my pilgrimage.”
                                                      ----Sir Walter Raleigh, The Passionate Man’s Pilgrimage, c. 1603
In this course, we will explore the notion of pilgrimage in the art and architecture of central Italy, through reading,
discussion, site visits, presentations, and post-field trip analyses. Why did people travel in the Middle Ages and
Renaissance? How were these journeys reflected in art and architecture, whether as portable objects (small
devotional altarpieces, for example), reliquaries (from the small and practical to the large and elaborate), illustrated
books and manuscripts, narratives of journeys, pilgrimage churches and hospices (such as the Ospedale of Santa
Maria della Scala in Siena), or large scale paintings of experienced or spiritual travel, such as Ambrogio
Lorenzetti’s Good and Bad Government frescoes in Siena and in Benozzo Gozzoli’s Journey of the Magi frescoes
in the Medici Palace? And how different was the medieval pilgrim, collecting her religious tokens along a
pilgrimage route, from today’s cultural “pilgrim”, who might collect T-shirts, post-cards, or even countries
themselves? Italy has long been a destination for travelers of every ilk: foreign merchants, religious pilgrims,
travelers in seek of adventure, and cultural enthusiasts. In the middle ages and Renaissance, the economies of Siena,
Florence, Rome and Venice were greatly enriched by both religious pilgrims and lay travelers, resulting in the
spectacular development of art and architecture that we know today. We will use the issue of travel and pilgrimage
as a prism with which we can focus our explorations of Italian art, both famous and obscure.

Global Cultures flag:
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your familiarity with
cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come
from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past or
present.
Visual and Performing Arts Credit (VAPA):
This course may be used to fulfill the visual and performing arts component of the university core curriculum and
addresses the following four core objectives established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board:
communication skills, critical thinking skills, teamwork, and social responsibility.
Reading:
All of your readings will be available in the class packet. This packet will include materials for both the studio and
the art history class, and thus it is mandatory. You will purchase this at our third meeting.
You must also purchase the MANDATORY field trip course packet, containing maps, plans, and important
information for our various field trips. You will also purchase this at our third meeting in the spring.
Grading:
See the separate handouts for explanations of the following assignments.
All handouts and assignments will also be posted on the class Canvas site.
Quiz: 10% (due date: Thursday, 6/6)
FIVE Short Reading Responses: each 5%, for a total of 25% (due date: the day we discuss them them)
On-site Presentation: 20% (finish by Thursday, 6/20)
Participation and Attendance: 20%
Group Project: 25% (due date: Friday, 7/5, but these dates are very much subject to change)
Unexcused absences or tardiness to classes or other appointments will greatly affect your grade. An unexcused
absence or tardiness to a field trip will HUGELY and NEGATIVELY affect your grade.
We will use +/- system of grades.
A (4.00) = 94-100; A- (3.67) = 90-93; B+ (3.33) = 87-89; B (3.00) = 84-86; B- (2.67) = 80-83;
C+ (2.33) = 77-79; C (2.00) = 74-76; C- (1.67) = 70-73; D+ (1.33) = 67-69; D (1.00) = 64-66;
D- (0.67) = 60-63; F (0.00) = 0-59
If you show up, participate, work hard, and have a good attitude, you will get a good grade. In other words, it is
your “A” to lose.
Classes:
Our class will (most likely) meet in a classroom at the University of Siena from 9-12. However, most days, we will
work onsite throughout the city of Siena. Classes meet on the days listed, below.
