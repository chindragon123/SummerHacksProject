Course Description:
This course is an introduction to Cultural Anthropology in the Global Age. It is designed
to introduce students to the central concepts, theories, and techniques employed by
cultural anthropologists to explore the social and cultural dimensions of human
experience in the 21st century. The course is organized around central questions in the
study of human societies, including what it means to study culture, language, and belief
systems in an interconnected global age; how systems of power affect our understandings
of race, ethnicity, nationalism, gender, sexuality, age, and class; and how changes in the

modern world influence our cultural understanding and practice of such fundamental
issues as politics, economics, health, religion migration, and art.
This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity
courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the
American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your
grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least
one U.S. cultural group—including your own!
Course Objectives
1. To familiarize students with the founding concepts, methods and debates in the
discipline of cultural anthropology.
2. To develop a critical analysis of how culture, as system(s) of meaning, constructs our
everyday life.
3. To generate an appreciation for cultural diversity.
4. To highlight the connections between the students’ lives to other places, peoples, and
processes in the world.
5. To understand the role of power in creating systems of hierarchy and oppression
both locally and globally.

Course Requirements and Grading:
Grading Policy: Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following
university-prescribed plus/minus rubric. Please note: to ensure fairness, all grades are
absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. The University does not
recognize the grade of A+.
A = 94-100; A- = 90-93; B+ = 87-89; B = 84-86; B- = 80-83; C+ = 77-79; C = 74-76;


ANT 302 SP 2019                                                                              3
Instructor: Dr. Suzanne Seriff
C- = 70-73; D+ = 67-69; D = 64-66; D- = 60-63;               F= 0-60
ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION: (30%): Every student will be assigned a
section with obligatory meetings each week. Attendance will be taken both in lecture and
in your section and students are responsible for information covered in both lectures and
sections. Attendance and participation—through in class discussion, on line discussion
blogs, lectures, lecture quizzes, and class presentations-- will constitute 30% of your
semester grade. Each week there will be required readings, and a discussion blog.
    •   The discussion blog is our CANVAS site for summarizing and analyzing the
        articles assigned each week from the Reader, based on concepts introduced in the
        Toolkit. Most weeks, your TA will formulate a question/prompt in the discussion
        section of Canvas which relates to your readings/topic for the week. Some weeks,
        the discussion blog prompt will require you to apply the concepts we learn in
        class to a fieldwork exercise out in the world. Most weeks, the discussion blog
        prompt will ask you to analyze one of the ethnographic excerpts from your
        Reader in terms of main points or terms outlined in your Toolkit. There will be 11
        blogs total, from which you will select the top 10 for your blog grade. You will
        get no points for turning the blog in late or missing a blog, and there will be no
        make ups. All blog entries are due by 9pm the day before your section. The blog
        entries should be about a page in length (double spaced) and fully address each of
        the elements in the prompt. Discussion blog entries are worth 10% of your final
        grade.
    •   Class Lectures: Students are expected to attend lectures regularly. Lecture
        outlines will be posted as ppt documents the week before the midterm and the end
        of term exam. Students are urged to follow the lectures carefully, take selective
        notes and participate in class discussions rather than trying to write everything
        down. All films listed under the Assignment column will be shown during lecture.
        They are listed here only in case you need to see them outside of class. In order to
        insure your attendance at lecture, there will be 5 pop quizzes during the semester.
        The entry code for the pop quiz, which you will complete on Canvas, will be
        announced ONLY during lecture and must be completed during that same day.
        There will be NO Makeup quizzes, even if you have an excused absence. We will
        give 6 quizzes throughout the semester and you will take the top five as credits for
        your lecture grade. Lecture quizzes are worth 5% of your final grade
    •   Section attendance is worth 10% of your grade. Attendance will be taken each
        day of section by the TA. You are allowed one unexcused section absence without
        penalty. After that, each unexcused absence in your section class will count for 2
        points off of your final grade, up to 5 absences. If you miss more than 5 sections,
        you will be docked your full participation grade as well.
    •   Participation is worth 5% of your grade. TAs will keep track of your
        participation including both the number of times you contribute to discussion and
        the quality of your contributions. If your contributions are particularly insightful

Instructor: Dr. Suzanne Seriff
        and/or reflect a good grasp of the readings and materials, you will get the full 5
        points. The section you are assigned is listed on your registration materials by
        unique number, and is also available through the Canvas. You must attend the
        section for which you are officially enrolled.
MIDTERM and END OF TERM EXAM (50%): This portion of your grade consists of
your midterm and end of term exam. The midterm exam will be given on a regular class
day the week before spring break, and the final exam will be given during the final 3 hour
exam slot scheduled by the university for our course. Each test (the midterm and second
exam) will include multiple choice questions, fill in the blank questions, and short essay
questions. Questions will include material covered in the assigned readings, lectures,
discussions, and films. The second exam will only cover material from the second half of
the course (after spring break) but will include a longer essay which will specifically test
you on your critical analysis of the “Aint No Makin It” ethnography we have read in
class. Make-up exams will only be given in the event of a serious illness or emergency,
for which official documentation is required. The midterm will be worth 20% of your
final grade and the final exam will be worth 30% of your final grade.
WRITING ASSIGNMENT (20%): You will also be assigned one paper topic during the
second half of the semester. The paper should be between 5-6 pages in length. It will
have several cumulative components, each of which will be graded separately, including
a fieldwork component, a data gathering/research component, and an analysis
component.
Academic Honesty:
Students are required to do their own research and work. All students are responsible for
knowing the standards of academic honesty:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis.php. Plagiarism, using research without
citations or using a created production without crediting a source, is forbidden. This
applies to any non-credited websites (including Wikipedia) as well as written sources. All
suspicions of plagiarism will be immediately sent to the Dean for consideration.
Students with Disabilities:
Students with disabilities may arrange for necessary accommodations for the course by
contacting the office of Services for Students with Disabilities, within the Division of
Diversity and Community Engagement. This office can make arrangements in
coordination with the instructor, given proper advance notice. For more information, as
well as the relevant online forms, call SSD at 471-6259 or look them up
at: http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.
Classroom Etiquette:
Please respect the class, the instructor and your fellow students by avoiding disruptive
behaviors including private conversations, napping, or attending to something outside the
scope of the class. Absolutely no cell phones are allowed in class or lecture. All visible
cell phones will be picked up during class and returned to students after class. Computers
only allowed in lecture with prior permission.

Instructor: Dr. Suzanne Seriff
Canvas and Electronic Reserves:
Students will find the CANVAS site under the unique number for which they are
enrolled. All correspondence between you, your TA, and your fellow students in your
section and your instructor will be conducted within this site. Please regularly check the
announcements on the site, which is where your instructor will convey any changes to the
schedule, due dates, or general announcements. The CANVAS site will be demonstrated
during the first week of the class in your section.
    •   The CANVAS site will include the syllabus, any instructions or announcements to
        students, power points of the week’s lectures (uploaded before each exam), exam
        reviews, prompts for your discussion blogs, assignment instructions and access to
        any additional readings or URLs (in addition to your textbooks) These will be
        found under FILES on your CANVAS page. All emails to the professor should be
        to sseriff@austin.utexas.edu
