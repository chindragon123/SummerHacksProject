This course is part of the Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) program this semester. Your ULA, Joshua
Ramirez, was selected because he has expertise that can help you be successful in the course. Think of your ULA as
an approachable, near-peer mentor whose purpose is to help you learn during and outside of class. Joshua will
often be the first person you contact if you have questions about demo / lab assignments. I encourage you to take
advantage of his Lab hours.
ULAs do not grade any assignments and cannot answer questions about your grades. For questions about grades,
please contact TA, Jeongmin Ham or Professor Erin Reilly.
                                            Course Description
As the media landscape becomes populated with more and more screens—from television and computer screens
to mobile displays, but also virtual reality headsets, other wearable devices, and a rapidly growing Internet of
Things—we have quite literally a whole world of possibilities for creating experimental storytelling experiences.
These technologies offer unique potential for creating new and different kinds of experiences, including ones that
respond with increasing precision to people’s behavior and input. So how might these screens (and the ecosystem
within which they function) change the stories we share, but also how we share them? What might be the next
step beyond the screen?
This course aims to introduce students to experimental storytelling that explores our senses, the physical and
virtual world to create an immersive story experience. Using design thinking and human computer interaction,
students will ideate, synthesize concepts, create user scenarios based on the story’s audience and develop a POC
(proof of concept) for feedback and entry into becoming new creators.
Course Learning Outcomes
     ● Expose students to new affordances of emerging media.
     ● Introduce students to different models of storytelling
     ● Encourage students to test out multiple forms of storytelling through their mobile device and computer.

    Assignments
       1.   Social Media Experiment - @48moods | 20%
            In numerology the number 48 resonates with creative expression, so nothing better than having
            Experimental Storytelling be a culmination of creative expression made through a collective story
            together. Stories are complex, yet simple; participatory, yet controlled; and unequivocally are
            visceral, can trigger behavior and over time are reflective of our individual agency, our shared
            moment in time and the culture that we live in. The syllabus has 2 themes per week with specific
            days (Sunday and Tuesday) scheduled to post and your reflection on your peers due by day of class
            (Thursday). Using 99 Ways to Tell a Story as inspiration, your goal with each assignment is to
            compose an original photo and haiku that best represents your personal take on the theme
            proposed, then post it to @48moods on Instagram.
            Haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry. Haiku poems consist of 3 lines. The first and last
            lines of a Haiku have 5 syllables and the middle line has 7 syllables. The lines rarely rhyme. Many
            people consider Haikus as unfinished poems, a poem that the reader finishes in his or her mind.
            Often keeping a journal is encouraged in creative classes, a place to write down ideas, draw
            images, and jot down potential projects. In a digital-first world, my choice for using @48moods as
            a form of journaling is for you to learn to get a nugget of a story idea down quickly, to practice
            being creative “in public” – giving way to better understanding how to pitch an idea in its simplest
            form and have a chance for public to react immediately.
                                                                               Syllabus for COURSE-ID, Page 7 of 4


   Over the course of the semester, sharing and commenting on each other’s work… the posts that
   evoke a visceral, behavioral or reflective moment for you individually is encouraged. You can
   critique anyone in the class. However, please do not critique the same person each week. We will
   be checking to make sure you’re critiquing different people each week. However, if you love a
   peer’s work, by all means …comment, heart it as often as you want. Be ready to share your
   comments on your own work as well as your peers… students will randomly be called on each class
   to reflect on @48moods. For examples, see @erinbreilly.
   ** NOTE: Grad Students are required to do an extra project to complete their grade for this
   project. Starting Week 7, Grad Students will work together to propose an experimental book
   curating the collective story into a sellable product. Week 10, Grad Students will have all material
   in hand to curate and edit completing it by Week 13 to go to the printers and be ready to sell to
   peers and guests during Week 15 showcase. **
2. TXI – New Recruit Story Kit” | 15%
   The first 6 weeks of class will train you how to work in teams and develop an idea from story
   concept to completion. The entire class will be broken into unique teams that build on your core
   expertise to hone in on skills you are best at contributing within a team project. The class will work
   on the same concept together to complete the final product. Our goal is to develop a unique
   interactive story experience that is the “Acceptance Letter” to welcome the first cohort of 48
   students into the new specialization, Texas Immersive. (You’re a wizard, Harry)
   So, what is Texas Immersive?
        Interactive, intimate, experiential …the top three words that describe “Immersive” today.
        From Disney putting guests at the center of their own Star Wars world to Meow Wolf’s mantra
        of subverting reality… never before has there been more attention fixated on media that
        surrounds and envelopes its audiences, allowing them fully embodied experiences. Immersive
        connects multiple disciplines from theater to themed attractions to museums, retail, and
        public spaces. Each experience created has a strong ability to affect the audience on a deep
        level of engagement, and often use a variety of mixed media blending physical and digital
        interactions that connect the senses.
        This convergence of disciplines will form the foundation of Texas Immersive.
        Texas Immersive is an interdisciplinary specialization focused on four key areas: Audience –
        Story – Technology – Innovation. Developing these competencies will foster deep emotional
        connections, create lasting impact and prepare our students to take on real-world challenges.
        Overall, students will learn to become Experience Designers… those who understand how to
        target and build stronger relationships with audiences; tell stories and drive meaningful
        interactions in a connected environment; and create strong franchises using audience-centric
        activation models.
   Overall, this initial project will teach you how to design a captivating story and use game
   mechanics and different forms of engagement to help the “new recruits” push the story forward.
   Teams will shop for supplies, design all the assets and build out the story challenges. We will play
   test the 1st prototype and iterate if need be to ready it for mass production (after all 48 UT
   students will receive this in December).
3. Sandbox Demos/Analysis! @CMA 6.154 | 15%
   The best way to understand the future of storytelling is to experience it; to immerse yourself.
   Though I encourage you to make use of the Experience Lab as often as you can (See ULA Lab Hours
                                                                      Syllabus for COURSE-ID, Page 8 of 4


   above), you are required to visit it 3x throughout the semester on the specific dates noted in the
   schedule above.
   Your grade will be a combination of your 3 visits. You will need to Sign up to use the lab ahead of
   time noting which demo you plan to review by choosing from Lab Demos google doc. You are
   required to watch it / play with it and then offer an analysis (minimum 500 words) of the
   experience.
   The analysis should incorporate at least two ideas or concepts from Professor Reilly’s lectures or
   Guest Lectures. It’s also encouraged to incorporate relevant material from other classes and
   outside experience, in addition to the readings assigned or the books recommended in this course.
   Keep in mind, this is a scholarly research analysis. Though a certain informality in tone is
   permissible, even desirable, student writing should be well-written, coherently organized, and
   thought-provoking. Your analysis should make the students want to demo this experience.
   Rather than writing into the void each week, students have been placed in groups (See google
   doc). Students are required to have a conversation with two of their group peers each time. A
   conversation is dialogue so author and respondent should discuss, reply to each other. I’m not
   looking for “That’s cool.” Or “I really like what you wrote.” But rather reflect together and discuss
   the core concepts coming out of the class in relation to the analysis.
4. Final Project: Real-World Client Project
   Choice of Location-Based Story or Public Interactive Experience | 30%
   We communicate to connect with other human beings. We communicate to express our feelings
   or to share a story. We communicate to create a better world. Throughout our existence, humans
   have developed new ways to communicate from grunts and groans to language to the printing
   press and the internet. Every day students and faculty at UT are discovering new ways to
   communicate, new ways to make the human experience better.
   Our first real-world client is the new Campus Admissions Visitor Center (Still securing but pretty
   sure). They’re looking to us to create location-based story experiences or an immersive interactive
   and compelling experience that not only showcases the people and work being done at UT but
   gives visitors a chance to interact with these stories and be inspired to join the UT community.
   Each student will submit an Individual Guest Experience (5% of Grade). These will be pitched via a
   1 minute video. The top ones will pitch to the client each)Student teams (team of 4 students
   each) will work as an experience design team to create a guest experience, pitch it to the client and
   develop a prototype in the form of a location-based story application or a visitor center interactive
   story zone. Teams will develop story experiences that offer both a lean-back and lean-in
   experiences. They will develop across multiple mediums ensuring that the team has thoughtfully
   considered the audience and how they learn about it, the actual immersive experience and what
   participants receive or leave with to carry the idea forward. Teams will use Discord as means to
   collaborate on production and show works in progress, teams will ideate, conduct market
   research, design look and feel, create assets, build proof of concept and pitch the guest experience
   to the client. With feedback, the team will develop a working prototype with a video showcase (up
   to 3 minutes) to share with the public Week 15.
5. Sandbox Recommendation! @CMA 6.154 | 10%
   Based on weekly themes in class, make a recommendation of a new demo and post it on the
   Student Demo Recommendation tab on this google sheet. The goal of to involve you in active
   processes of learning beyond the classroom and understand the wider community participating in
   experimental stories. You need to select an individual platform or experience and identify it’s
   unique affordances.
                                                                      Syllabus for COURSE-ID, Page 9 of 4


     6.   Attendance (Activities / Discussions) | 10%
          Weekly activities and discussions in the classroom as well as on canvas will be graded with a pass
          or fail. This means, you participated and completed the work – pass; you didn’t -- fail. I expect you
          to “Lean In” to this course. It’s not a course you can sit back and just pass.
          This grade is for informal activities and discussions during class. They are some of the most
          valuable and interactive aspects of our course and offers us an opportunity to share diverse
          insights, reflect and collaborate on the course concepts. This is an outlet for exploratory learning
          and expressing ideas and perspectives beyond the projects.
          In discussions, you should avoid merely a compliment (e.g. "Interesting post...") or support (e.g. "I
          agree with you...") of another student's work. You will not be given credit for activity or discussions
          that do not meaningfully contribute to or expand the conversation, as determined by the
          instructor’s assessment.

Classroom Expectations
 Class attendance
 We meet only once a week. Attendance is required at all class, presentation, client and team meetings. We
 may also have a significant number of meetings that are off site and 1 outside the scheduled class time.
 There will be no excused absences. Failure to attend any of these meetings will affect your grade and
 could reduce your final grade by as much as two letter grades. Attendance means showing up to the class
 or meeting on time. Habitual lateness will affect your grade.
 Class participation
 Teamwork: This course is primarily structured around teamwork. You will self-assign yourself to a pair and
 a group, and the bulk of your work in the course will be carried out and evaluated based on these teams.
 Teams will consist of varying personalities, skills and interests and you must find a way to manage these
 differences. The ability to cooperate, to communicate and to work effectively is essential to creating
 successful strategies and creative briefs, both in this class and in the real world. Once students have been
 assigned to teams, I will not adjust the membership of these teams. Although I don’t anticipate any
 problems, if issues do arise I expect you to resolve them yourselves, just as you would in a real-world job
 situation.
 Deadlines: This class simulates the real world, and in the real world, deadlines are non-negotiable. All
 assignments must be handed in on time. Late assignments or projects will not be accepted and you will not
 earn any points (i.e. you will receive a grade of 0) for that assignment. The usual litany of excuses (I slept
 through my alarm, I missed the bus, I have a cold, my grandmother died) won’t work. In the real world,
 failure to meet a deadline could result in you losing your job. Now is the time to practice time
 management and adherence to deadlines.
 Time management: This course is very demanding on your time. Your teammates in this class will judge
 you on how much, and the quality of, work you contribute to your class project. Do not lose track of what
 is most important.
 Communication: The primary way I will communicate with you outside of class is through canvas. You are
 responsible for making sure you get any messages from me and you are responsible for the content of
 those announcements. I may notify you via canvas about a change in meeting times or assignment
 deadlines. Failure to check your canvas does not excuse you from meeting the responsibilities outlined in
 the message. At a minimum, you should check your canvas once every day.
 Plagiarism: Everything you produce in this class must be your original work. If you have help from anyone
 outside this class it will be considered a breach of UT’s policy on Scholastic Integrity and will be dealt with
 accordingly.
                                                                           Syllabus for COURSE-ID, Page 11 of 4


                                                Policies
 Classroom Policies
 Statement on Learning Success
 Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn
 differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me
 know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the
 requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student resources available through
 UT. Many are listed on this syllabus, but I am happy to connect you with a person or Center if you would
 like.
 Grading Policies
 Weekly meetings and participation – LAB time:
 LAB time will consist of you meeting in your groups, trying out the demos or out in the field workshopping
 the different methods or projects assigned. Your attendance, attitude, contribution and participation in
 these meetings and in the field will be assessed and will contribute to your final grade.
 Attendance and Professionalism
 Attendance at all classes and meetings is required. It is also assumed that students will be active
 participants in class. Simply being present in the room is not sufficient; you must also be engaged and
 involved scholars. Participation – not just attendance – is integral to a successful, enjoyable class and to
 you earning a high grade. Active participation means contributing to the discussion, listening to what your
 colleagues have to say and engaging with the readings and in-class activities. It means showing up on time,
 not checking Facebook or email on your computer, not texting on your phone. NOTE that if you do not
 participate in class discussions, you will not earn full points for attendance even if you come to every class.
 Peer Evaluations
 You will be asked to provide an assessment of your and your teammates' contributions to the
 Final project. They will be taken into account in final assignment of grades.
 Grading System:
 This class will be graded using the plus/minus grading system, as outlined by the university’s provost office
 (http://www.utexas.edu/provost/planning/plus-minus/). Advertising and PR majors are required to have a
 minimum grade of C in all communication courses and in all required and elective courses in order to
 continue in the program.
NOTES on Grading:
     • Late work is not accepted.
     • I will NOT be rounding up percentage grades or points. So if you earn an 89.6% that translates into
         a B+ and will not be rounded up to 90% (an A-).
     • Any questions or comments about a grade must be presented in writing within seven (7) days after
         the grade is announced or posted.
     • When I grade your work, you start with zero points. You earn points based on the quality of the
         work and the accuracy, appropriateness and detail of your answers. You do not start with 100
         points and then lose them based on mistakes you make. Your final points represent the total
         points earned for that assignment, not the number of points “taken away” for errors or omissions.
                                                                           Syllabus for COURSE-ID, Page 12 of 4


Absences
 The only absences that will be considered excused are for religious holidays or extenuating
 circumstances due to an emergency. You will be given attendance/participation credit for any session that
 you miss that is documented to the teaching team in writing by a medical doctor’s statement, or an official
 statement from a UT faculty member about an ensemble or other organization’s off-campus commitment.
 NO OTHER ABSENCES WILL BE EXCUSED.
                                    Student Rights & Responsibilities
     •   You have a right to a learning environment that supports mental and physical wellness.
     •   You have a right to respect.
     •   You have a right to be assessed and graded fairly.
     •   You have a right to freedom of opinion and expression.
     •   You have a right to privacy and confidentiality.
     •   You have a right to meaningful and equal participation, to self-organize groups to improve your

     •   You have a right to learn in an environment that is welcoming to all people. No student shall be
         isolated, excluded or diminished in any way.
With these rights come responsibilities:
     • You are responsible for taking care of yourself, managing your time, and communicating with the
         teaching team and with others if things start to feel out of control or overwhelming.
     • You are responsible for acting in a way that is worthy of respect and always respectful of others. •
         Your experience with this course is directly related to the quality of the energy that you bring to it,
         and your energy shapes the quality of your peers’ experiences.
     • You are responsible for creating an inclusive environment and for speaking up when someone is
         excluded.
     • You are responsible for holding yourself accountable to these standards, holding each other to
         these standards, and holding the teaching team accountable as well.
Personal Pronoun Preference
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing
with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and
nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will gladly honor
your request to address you by a name different than what appears on the roster, and by the gender
pronouns you use. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate
changes to my records.
                                              University Policies
Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a
student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University
and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use
words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your
sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action,
including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and
the      University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
                                                                            Syllabus for COURSE-ID, Page 13 of 4


Q Drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed
six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn
differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me
know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements
of the course. There are also a range of resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information
that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be
evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment for all
students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain
the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact Services for Students with Disabilities,
512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope
with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking
for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Title IX Reporting
                                                                          Syllabus for COURSE-ID, Page 14 of 4


Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment,
sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational
institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from
discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
      1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
      2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
           become involved in a Title IX investigation.
      3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory
Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I
am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing,
discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX
related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with
someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and resources, visit
titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
