This course bears 3 core flags: WRITING COMPONENT, CULTURAL DIVERSITY, INDEPENDENT INQUIRY
______________________________________________________________________________________
This seminar encourages students with some familiarity with mid-20th century civil rights movements to
more deeply explore themes
discussed only briefly in a broad
lecture course. We concentrate
primarily on African American and
Mexican American struggles involving
civil rights and other issues of race.
Students consider the distinctiveness
of specific struggles while also
viewing them in relation to each
other, as participants often did in that
time period. This comparative and
relational approach allows students
to develop insights that would be
unlikely in courses with traditional
approaches. It is vital for grasping
complex histories of the University of
Texas, Austin, Texas, and the South.
We also explore understandings of race, gender, national identity and class that may have impacted these
movements. Most broadly put, the course encourages fresh understandings of the mid-20th century U.S.
Readings range broadly, but this year the research project will be Race and Civil Rights at the University of
Texas, 1945-1975. The goal is for each student to contribute to a larger body of knowledge, which will
emerge out of both individual research projects, participation in group presentations, and a digital
humanities project. Despite much interest in this subject—sparked by debate over Confederate
memorials, affirmative action, status of immigrant students, hate incidents, achievement of new
departments in African American and Mexican American studies and more—there are few studies about
the the historical roots of these contemporary issues. As Longhorns, we want to know more about UT
history, but we will work on discerning how this research illuminates and perhaps even challenges current
narratives of national struggles over race and civil rights.
                                         OBJECTIVES OF THE COURSE
  ¨         To deepen knowledge of the history of campus and wider struggles around race and civil rights.
  ¨         To gain familiarity with a comparative and relational approach to this history.
  ¨         To further understand how cultural ideas such as those of race, class, gender, and national
            identity impacted these conflicts.
  ¨         To develop research and writing skills employed by historians, such as analyzing documents,
            using Chicago-style footnotes, and articulating original perspectives based on research.
  ¨         To write a substantial research essay based on a sustained semester-long project.
  ¨         To adapt this research for other forms of presentation, both oral and digital.
  ¨         To dig deeply, have adventures in the archives, and HAVE FUN!


                                                        STRUCTURE
This course is organized around weekly seminars, and your engagement will determine the success of the
course! I’ve built in ways for you to get involved: writing out thoughts on readings, participating in group
projects, leaving the classroom for visits to archives and a “Racial Geography Tour.” Leave uncomfortable
shoes at home! Until the final weeks, I divide classes between discussing readings and other activities.
DON’T BE DAUNTED by the reading. I can highlight key points, help you improve reading and note-taking
skills, and consider adjustments if need be. IT’S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO LET ME KNOW.
Work outside class contributes to your projects: reading comments, a “Sweatt v. Painter Scavenger Hunt,”
research, writing, developing your oral presentation and working with your group to coordinate the panel;
and contributing to the digital humanities project. NEVER WRITTEN SUCH A PAPER? DON’T PANIC! I won’t
assign the paper and desert you. I will give you a list of possible subjects and resources and walk you
through tasks leading to the final paper. I create class time to coordinate panel discussions and work on
the digital project. YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO HIT ALL DEADLINES FOR THOSE BUILDING BLOCKS.
SNACKS FOR CLASS: If you’d like, I will create a schedule for each of you to bring a snack for everyone, to
consume mid-way through the class.

           Attend class! (See attendance policy.)                 Visit me in office hours
           Submit all assignments on time.                        Visit Undergraduate Writing Center.
           Participate in class.                                  Attend extra credit event.
           Complete readings by date on syllabus.
                                                 ATTENDANCE
Since this class meets once a week, you get 1 unexcused absence freebie, but for each unexcused absence
beyond that I deduct 2 points from your final grade. Documented medical and family emergencies are
excused, as are religious holidays and official UT business requiring out-of-town travel with advance written
notice (excluding job interviews). Frequent late arrivals or early departures may add up to an unexcused
absence, at my discretion, especially if they involve more than a few minutes. IF you anticipate having
regular problems arriving no later than 3 p.m. sharp, please speak to me now.
                                      ASSIGNMENTS: BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS
250-Word Commentaries on Readings of the Week
DUE 5 P.M. THE EVENING BEFORE CLASS, typed, double-spaced, and uploaded on Canvas. Each of you will
write 5 of these. Everyone writes the first one, then you’ll be divided into Group A and Group B. They’re
meant to provide the basis for a lively, thoughtful discussion on the readings. You may use an informal
style, but check for spelling and grammar. I’m looking for insights into central issues addressed by the
readings, including what they mean to you, positively or negatively (or both). Sometimes I’ll ask you to
compare and contrast 2 readings. AVOID: TANGENTS ABOUT TODAY, SUMMARIES INSTEAD OF
COMMENTARIES, AND BIG GENERALIZATIONS NOT REALLY ROOTED IN THESE READINGS.
Sweatt v. Painter Scavenger Hunt: Focuses on the 1950 Supreme Court case that desegregated the UT Law
School as well as graduate study at other universities. You’ll have exactly two hours to survey and study
documents in an assigned collection at one of the research libraries, assess the files, and select the
document you think is most significant. You’ll complete a form and bring it to class for a group project.
Overall Research Project: “Race and Civil Rights at the University of Texas, 1945-1975”
¨          Final Papers of 4,500-5,000 words will center on an aspect of UT history while also addressing a
           key theme in national narratives. They include: an introduction centered on a “problematic” (i.e.,
           why your paper matters); discussion of your project in light of published scholarship on contexts
           outside UT; a sustained argument based on primary documents and oral histories; sections that
           form building blocks for the paper; a conclusion; and footnotes and bibliography in Chicago style.
¨          Stepping Stone Assignments: I have broken down the development of your paper into a series of
           smaller assignments such as submitting a brief proposal, formulating a research question,
           developing a bibliography, analyzing a key document, and writing an introduction.
¨          Penultimate Draft: This is a key element of the project. To the best of your ability, you will have
           drafted an introduction, the sections of the paper, and a tentative conclusion. It’s usually the
           case that after one completes a full draft, one gains new insight into the larger argument. You
           will now have the opportunity to get my feedback to help you turn the draft into a final paper.
Oral Presentations: I will organize you into conference-style thematic panels of 3-5 students. Most of you
will not pursue projects that are comparative in nature, but you will begin to think in comparative and
relational terms once you work with your co-panelists. These are also intended to: 1) challenge you to
distill the most important point(s) of your research paper; 2) Learn how to project your ideas to an
audience outside of class; 3) present your findings more formally than class discussion, I WILL HELP!


Digital Humanities Project: It truly pains me when undergraduates undertake important historical projects
on topics of much interest to people outside of class, and they end with submitting it for a grade, perhaps
showing it to a family member. We will be partnering with the Division of Diversity and Community
Engagement and/or the History Department on a project such as a timeline that will ultimately be publicly
accessible. Each of you will submit an element, completed in the final class session.
                                                   OFFICE HOURS
At certain points I require you to talk with me in office hours, but I welcome you to come at other times.
Contact me if you can’t make my hours. Familiarize yourself with my concealed carry policy.
                                                LATE ASSIGNMENTS
IF YOU SUBMIT AN ASSIGNMENT after the end of the day it is due because of an excused absence, you
will receive full credit. If you submit it after the end of the day it is due because of an unexcused absence,
you will lose 25% of your submission grade for each day it is late.
                                           CLASSROOM COMPORTMENT
¨ I expect you to arrive by 3:00 and stay until class is over.
¨ I encourage discussion and try to create a safe environment for it. To ensure we can have conversations
   about difficult issues, I ask you to speak respectfully to others, especially if you strongly disagree.
¨ I expect you to silence and stow your phones the entire class. This means taking notes on paper or a
   different device.
¨ You may use laptops to take notes but not for any other reasons.
¨ Any weapon brought to class must be 100% concealed and always with you or 911 will be called.

Most accommodations approved by Services for Students with Disabilities will be provided, only after you
bring the form to me in office hours and discuss accommodations in person. Do this early in the semester
so your accommodations are in place when you need them. If you don’t have accommodations but think
you should, visit http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/ to schedule an appointment.
                                               ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
UT adheres to strict guidelines regarding academic integrity including plagiarism. This is especially pertinent
for writing intensive courses. These guidelines extend to all material found on the Internet, in addition to
print materials. They also pertain to certain kinds of sharing work among students, such that a student
submits work that is not her/his own. Penalties for violations may include loss of credit for the course and
a report to the Student Judicial Services. Familiarize yourself with this History Dept. website.
