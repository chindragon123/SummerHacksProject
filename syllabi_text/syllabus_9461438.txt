Course Overview and Objectives
Media Investments is an introduction to the art and science of media placement. Media 'buys' typically
represent the largest percentage of an advertising budget, thus impactful and efficient media schedules
are critical to the success of every advertising campaign. The best creative is meaningless if no one sees
the work. The best plans are meaningless without effective, strategic, comprehensive media evaluation,
assertive negotiation and secure placements. Advertisers have an expectation that their money will be
spent wisely and that those responsible for the investments will be accountable for every dollar - no one
can afford a different scenario. This class is designed to prepare you for the realities of today's
fractured media marketplace and will equip you with tools you need to thrive (not just survive) at job
one on day one.
This course will be presented from three points of view - agency, client and vendor. Perspective is
crucial, as the ability to approach media opportunities from different points of view directly impacts the
outcome for all involved. The more nimble your mind, the more information you have, the more often
you will win. While possessing an intimate knowledge of the technical aspects and metrics associated
with different media types is essential to assessing advertising opportunities, there is more to media
investing than knowing the numbers. Through the course of the semester we will:
        build a strong familiarity with various tones, techniques and delivery-methods regularly used by
         parties involved in the investment process
        develop a fluid understanding of how and why certain tones, techniques and delivery-methods
         are impactful (and/or damaging)
        acquire effective personal techniques to use throughout the negotiation process, under a
         variety of conditions
        establish a solid foundation and understanding of data sets and KPIs used to evaluate each
         major media type
        expand our media vocabularies to include a thorough understanding of investment-related
         terminology
        gain the ability to comprehensively evaluate multiple media offerings and provide solid rationale
         for conclusions
        put forth strategic recommendations & close the sale (to the client, vendor and agency)
        become skilled at contributing to the campaign process in every role to improve client results
        learn to move beyond the obvious and become innovative in our approach to media
        avoid 'shiny object syndrome'
        remove ‘that’s not my job’ from our vocabularies


Assignments
Broadcast Buying Grids - One of the most important tools used to build and analyze broadcast
schedules is media buying software, providing an organized look at investment options. In this exercise,
students will construct their own buying grids in Excel. Two grids will be constructed & formula loaded -
one for radio & the other for television/cable.
One on Ones - With so many media options available to investors, time, access and information have
become precious commodities. For this exercise, the class will be randomly split in half. Students in
group A will be buyers. Buyers will receive a client briefing document prior to the one-on-one meetings.
Students in group B will become sellers and will receive a sales product/priority briefing, along with a list
of clients the buyers represent. On the first one-on-one session day, the buyers will host a series of 7-
minute meetings with various sellers. After each meeting, both the buyer and the seller will have 7
minutes to complete a review/assessment of the meeting on a provided assessment form. On the
second one-on-one session day, the roles of groups A & B will be reversed. Following the session days,
each student will compose two single-page POVs - one on the importance of effective tactics and
delivery-methods utilized by buyers in the investment process and the second on the same for sellers.
The narratives will be personalized and introspective. Grades for this exercise will be weighted 80%
POVs/materials prepared for the exercise, 20% assessment forms.
Media Buying Exercises - Rapid-response homework assignments. Total of five. Will be given in class,
will be due the next class day.
Media Investment Portfolio – Student groups will be presented with real-time media avails and will
complete buys in each major media type on behalf of an actual client. Buy summary paperwork and
rationale will be completed, as it would be for a supervisor/client, and all materials will be submitted at
the end of the semester. The resulting portfolio will demonstrate the students’ knowledge of sound
investment options in each vertical and an understanding of the elements of value in each media type as
they relate to client goals.
Build Your Media Knowledge Base – You are expected to stay current with media news and events.
Suggested reading includes www.mediapost.com, www.mediaweek.com, www.adage.com,
www.imediaconnections.com, www.iab.net. Specific articles may be assigned throughout the semester.
Attendance & participation – Class begins promptly at 8a. Arrival after 8a will result in loss of credit for
attendance on that day, without exception. Small assignments may be given throughout the semester
to facilitate discussion in class. These assignments will be turned in & counted toward the participation
grade, along with verbal participation during class itself.

Deadlines and Standards
Materials for this course will primarily be distributed online, though some assignments will be made in
class. Email will also be used to communicate course information - check your email every day before
class. Graded assignments will be returned in class. Retain your original assignments until grades have
been submitted at the end of the semester. Assignments not retrieved by the last class day will be
destroyed.
Hard copies of all assignments are to be submitted in class, by 8 a.m. on the scheduled due dates, unless
otherwise noted on the assignment emails. Paperwork should ALWAYS be ‘client-ready’ – presented in
a professional manner, stapled, foldered, etc. as appropriate. Points will be deducted if work
presented is not client ready. Late assignments, turned in past 8:00a, will be scored 0. It is advisable
and acceptable to turn assignments in early.
Attendance and participation are required at all class, presentation and team meetings. Please check in
with the TA upon arrival to class each day so that s/he may record your attendance. S/he will stop
recording at 8:02am – if you arrive past this point your attendance will not be recorded. Each student
will receive two ‘free’ days during the semester – absences on these days will not impact the student’s
attendance grade and may be used as the student sees fit (interviews, trips w other professors, etc.).
Note that OOO days may not be missed. These days are noted on the calendar. Significant absences
beyond the two ‘free’ days can affect a student’s final score by up to two letter grades. Depending upon
scheduling opportunities there may be optional off-site, after-hour and off-class day meetings. Students
are encouraged to attend these optional meetings.
No food or drink allowed in class. Cell phones should be turned off during class as well. If your phone
disrupts class you are required to leave the room in a quiet, orderly manner. You may rejoin the class at
the next regular class meeting.


Use of laptops/tablets in class is permitted for note-taking purposes only. If a student is observed
using a laptop for other purposes during class (including use of social media and IM) they will be asked
to turn the device off for the remainder of the class period.
Everything produced for class assignments is to be your original work. Enlisting aid from anyone outside
the class is considered a breach of UT’s Standard of Academic Integrity and will be dealt with
accordingly. All written assignments produced outside the classroom are to be composed on, and output
as, hard copy from a personal computer.
Participation in UT-Austin’s Electronic Course Instructor Survey (eCIS) is required. A screen shot
showing that the survey has been completed (a screen shot of the post-completion screen, NOT your
responses themselves) is to be submitted via email to the course TA by 8a on the last day of class.
Students that do not submit the survey will have 2.0 points deducted from their final grade.
Grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors can significantly reduce an assignment score. Please review
documents carefully before submitting for evaluation.
The schedule of events is tentative and is subject to change. Students are responsible for changes to the
schedule as announced in class or via email.
