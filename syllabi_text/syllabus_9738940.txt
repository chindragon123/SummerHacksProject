ICE DESERT / A TERRESTIAL ANALOGUE : Expansion_ Contraction_ Isolation in a Polar Environment
COURSE DESCRIPTION
ARC 560 is an Advanced Design comprehensive studio bridging many of the issues typically addressed in any advanced
design studio-- such as design methodologies and particular pedagogical intents as filtered through topical projects--with a
strong focus on the integration of technical issues and to the nature of presentation documents at all phases. Pragmatically,
the scheduling of production for course project begins with a research component to generate discoveries and to posit
linkages. A schematic design is produced in model and 2-d drawing formats, followed by design development with 3-d
components, and a sampling of detail drawings that would be typically included in a construction documents set.
Naturally, issues of construction and assemblies are framed within a set of concerns that are present in any type of
construction, such as expansion & contraction, moisture penetration and evacuation, ventilation, primary and secondary
structure, logic of connections, differential settlement, etc. Although the most significant issues will be addressed,
particular attention will be given to the nature of detail drawings and the final product produced by the students will result
in a presentation package that combines aspects of all phases of the course.
ASSIGNMENTS
Project
This course will consist of only one project the entire semester. However, numerous exercises directly related to
development of the project will also be issued within the design studio.
PRELIMINARY PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Antarctica is the coldest continent in the world. The lowest measured temperature has reached about -130 degrees
Fahrenheit. It is also the most arid, windiest, and most hidden on earth. Its discovery dates from the early 19th century
(1820), the last of all the continents.
Understandably, it has no native population, however, a number of international scientific research stations do provide it
with some human presence. According Oceanwide Expeditions (NL), there are over 50 permanent stations and
approximately 35 seasonal camps located on the condominium established through the Antarctic Treaty.
One of the areas of interest to NASA--and to this course—deals with “Terrestrial Analogue Environments (Sites)”. These are
locations on earth whereby a variety of conditions anticipated for extraterrestrial travel and habitation can be simulated.
Life on Antarctica is one such place; deserts in UTAH and Spain, the northern arctic in Canada (Devon Island), and Mauna
Kea (HI) are other such sites.
With regard to analogue sites, we are primarily interested in how such areas of protection and their resulting confinement
along with the attendant qualities present in the relativity of spatial extension impact our understandings and the
ramifications of spatial comfort; mentally and physically. Other obvious comfort factors include thermal and illumination
considerations
We know that history repeats itself. Generally, we have 2 ways of dealing with our external circumstances; engaging the
world or retreating from it.
In the last few years, meaningful dialogue has also been largely displaced and mirrored by the equipollent political positions
present in most of Western societies. Renewed and reinvigorated threats of nuclear weapons, civil unrest, and climatic
volatility have returned the term “shelter” closer to its base meaning.
As with most of the constructed world, the design professions engage a small percentage of the work accomplished.


Therefore, this year’s project is seen an opportunity to reconsider the incorporation of the base functions of “shelter” into a
future notion of what constitutes the necessities of a work environment & housing (that is to say building) as well as the
elevation of the human spirit (that is to say architecture).
Also, due to the nature of this course, additional pragmatics associated with any architectural realization shall include those
necessary priorities previously listed at the beginning of the course description.
Finally—and this is crucial—it is expected and required that through discovery via intellectual and physical production each
group of students will provide an additional line of inquiry and resolution that works in dialogue with the previous stated
objectives.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
The following learning objectives from previous semesters are listed below. It is expected that significantly further
development in the areas will occur throughout the entire range of activities associated with this course.
     •   Design Composition Skills: Developed through three-dimensional architectural form and space, both exterior and
         interior; building envelope
     •   Design Integration Skills: Demonstrated through creative engagement with issues of materiality, structures,
         construction, and environmental system
     •   Site Analysis and Design: Developed through the creative engagement with relevant contextual; environmental
         and programmatic factors underlying the project
     •   Critical Thinking: Quality of conceptual and critical thought; learning from precedents; research skills
     •   Graphic Skills: Quality of presentation; clarity of communication; appropriateness of media strategy and level of
         skill displayed
     •   Collaborative and Leadership Skills: Demonstrated through the active engagement in all activities of the studio
STUDIO CULTURE
The School of Architecture believes in the value of the design studio model. Studio learning encourages dialogue,
collaboration, risk-taking, innovation, and learning-by-doing. The studio offers an environment where students can come
together to ask questions and make proposals, which are developed and discussed among classmates, faculty, visiting
professionals, and the public-at-large. Studio learning offers intensive one-on-one instruction from faculty members, and
provides the opportunity for each student to develop his/her critical thinking skills and spatial and material sensibilities. The
design studio offers a synthetic form of education, where project-based learning becomes the foundation for developing an
understanding of and commitment to the school's core values — broadmindedness, interconnectivity, professionalism,
exploration and activism — all in service of architecture's fundamental mission: to improve the quality of the built and
natural environments.

STUDIO BEHAVIOR
     1. NO CELL PHONE USE AT ALL DURING CLASS TIME. Cell phones should be off and put away during class so they do
         not become a distraction. If you are using a cell phone during class, it will count against you as one absence.
     2. Please do not bring food into class during class time. Drinks are ok. Typically, you will have a 15 minute break daily
         3pm-3:45pm.
     3. Unless noted by the instructor, you are expected to be in studio the entire length of the class period. Leaving class
         early will constitute as an absence.
     4. Attentiveness- emphasizing that the entire studio time is class time and deserves the same attentiveness whether
         during lectures, instructional direction, or production. Discussions with fellow students are encouraged but should
         be directed toward studio work.
     5. Time management is a skill that will be directly addressed in this course and important to your overall success. This
         critical aspect is obviously not limited to class time only.


DESIGN CONVERSATIONS: JESSEN LECTURES
The School of Architecture offers a wide range of opportunities for students to extend the design conversations taken place
in studios (Lecture Series, Goldsmith Talks, Exhibitions, etc). Students are encouraged to participate and be engaged.
Specifically, all B.Arch and BSAS students in studio are expected to attend all the Jessen Lectures (three per semester by
lead practitioners from around the world). The lectures and the group discussions in studio that follow are important for
the holistic education of intellectually engaged students and participation will have an impact on students’ grades (see
below).
EVALUATION CRITERIA
While each project contains certain quantifiable elements for evaluation, a significant portion of each grade is derived from
broader and more subjective criteria.
Student work will be evaluated according to its rigor and evolution over the semester. Grades are subject to deductions for
late arrivals, absences, and late or incomplete work at the discretion of the instructor.
Grading for an assignment is broken into four components, each of which is given roughly equal weight:
     Pursuit: the consistent and rigorous development and testing of ideas.
          • The ability to formulate a query or thesis and pursue a self-determined concomitant method of inquiry
          • The ability to identify and implement various processual mechanisms (software, sketch drawing and models,
               etc.) in the development of the design
          • Initiative as demonstrated in work ethic – Does the student do what is asked; go beyond what is asked; direct
               their own efforts; eager to produce the next iteration of the design?
     Grasp: the ideas and understanding of the project at hand and integration of knowledge introduced in companion
     courses.
          • A strong and clearly stated design objective
          • Spatial acuity as demonstrated in plan – including reasonable disposition of programmatic elements – and
               sectional development
          • Synthetic and critical thinking; the ability to holistically organize a project as demonstrated through creative
               engagement with issues of materiality, structures and construction, structural and environmental system
               integration, building materials and assembly, sustainable practices, etc. in support of the design objective
          • Structural competence and material sensitivity as demonstrated in wall thickness, floor plates, and assembly
     Resolution: of the design objective; the demonstration of competence, completeness, and finesse in the final design
     presentation.
          • Quality of presentation; clarity of communication; appropriateness of media strategy and level of skill
               displayed through the work presented at all stages of the design process; technical documentation
     Engagement: the active participation in studio activities, leadership, collaboration, group discussions and reviews.
A student must earn a letter grade of C or better in order for the course to count towards a degree in the School of
Architecture and to progress in to the next studio. A letter grade of C- will not satisfy degree requirements.
GRADE DESCRIPTIONS
A/A-              Excellent
                  Project surpasses expectations in terms of inventiveness, appropriateness, visual language, conceptual rigor,
                  craft, and personal development. Student pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is
                  discussed in class. Project is complete on all levels.
B+/B/B-           Above Average
                  Project is thorough, well presented, diligently pursued, and successfully completed. Student pursues ideas
                  and suggestions presented in class and puts in effort to resolve required projects. Project is complete on all
                  levels and demonstrates potential for excellence.


C+/C              Average
                  Project meets the minimum requirements. Suggestions made in class and not pursued with dedication and
                  rigor. Project is incomplete in one or more areas.
C-/D+/D/D-        Poor
                  Project is incomplete. Basic grasp of skill is lacking, visual clarity or logic of presentation are not level-
                  appropriate. Student does not demonstrate the required competence and knowledge base.
F                 Fail
                  Project is unresolved. Minimum objectives are not met. Performance is not acceptable. Note that this grade
                  will be assigned when students have excessive unexcused absences.
X                 Excused Incomplete
                  Can be given only for legitimate reasons of illness or family emergency. Simply not completing work on time
                  is not an adequate cause for assigning this evaluation. It may only be used after consultation with the
                  Associate Deans' offices and with an agreement as to a new completion date. Work must be completed
                  before the second week of the next semester in which the student is enrolling, according to the School of
                  Architecture policy.
ATTENDANCE
Punctual and regular attendance is mandatory. Participation is expected. With three (3) unexcused absences, the student’s
final grade for the course will be lowered by a full letter grade. The final grade will be lowered by a full letter grade for
each unexcused absence thereafter. Aside from religious observances, absences are only excused with written
documentation of a medical issue or family emergency. The student is responsible for completing work missed due to
excused absences and initiating communication with the instructor to determine due dates.
If a student is late (5 minutes after the start of class) three (3) times, it will be counted as one (1) unexcused absence.
Students should notify the instructor prior to class if lateness or absence is known in advance. However, as stated above
only medical issues or family emergencies and religious observances constitute an excused absence. Students must
notify instructors directly regarding lateness or absences; e.g. asking a classmate to inform the instructor is not acceptable.
Note: unless stipulated by the instructor during certain moments in the schedule, leaving class early constitutes an absence.
RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES
A student shall be excused from attending classes of other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of
a religious holy day, including travel for the purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be
penalized for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the student
is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy requires students to notify each of their instructors
as far in advance of the absence as possible so that arrangements can be made.
By UT Austin policy, you must notify the instructor of the pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of a
religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, an assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy
day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Students who violate University policy on academic integrity are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of
failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the
integrity of the University, policies on academic integrity will be strictly enforced. Refer to the Student Conduct and
Academic Integrity website for official University policies and procedures on academic integrity:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/academicintegrity.php. University Code of Conduct:
http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/the-university/#universitycodeofconduct
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
Students with disabilities who require special accommodations must obtain a letter that documents the disability from the
Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of the Dean of Students (471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users
who are deaf or hard of hearing). This letter should be presented to the instructor in each course at the beginning of the
semester and accommodations needed should be discussed at that time.

SECURITY, SAFETY, AND THE STUDIO
The studio is an exceptional learning environment. Since it is a place for all, it necessitates the careful attention to the
needs of everyone. All spraying of fixative, spray paint, or any other substance should be done in the shop. Security is a
necessary component for a studio that is accessible to you and your colleagues 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Do not leave
your studio without your studio key and do not leave your studio unlocked. Hold yourself and your studiomates
accountable for the security of your shared space.
BCAL
Concerns regarding the safety or behavior of fellow students, Teaching Assistants (TA), or Professors can be reported to the
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050. Calls can be made anonymously. If something doesn’t feel right, it
probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.
EMERGENCY EVACUATION
In the case of emergency evacuation:
     • Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire
          alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
     • Students should familiarize themselves with all exit doors of each classroom and building they may occupy.
          Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one used when entering the building.
     • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class. In
          the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
     • Reentry into a building is prohibited unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The
          University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services offices.
     • Information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at:
          www.utexas.edu/emergency.
LIST OF REQUIRED/RECOMMENDED MATERIALS
This course will involve considerable physical and intellectual production. Drawings will involve 4 major presentations
(typically ranging from 15-30 sheets per presentation—24x36 and larger) and multiple physical models at all scales. No
specific materials are required as students are expected to make reasonable decisions concerning what materials best
represent their design and demonstrate their progress throughout the semester.
That said, possible drawing, model, and reading materials and format considerations will be suggested by the instructor at
each phase of the course in order to prompt the decision making processes required from the students towards a successful
project. Remember, investigation and experimentation is strongly encouraged at all stages of production and design and
therefore, the student should use materials commensurate with the objectives demanded by their projects. Lastly, the
anticipated materials and equipment prior to use on any given studio day shall be acquired prior to scheduled studio time.
Please consult with instructor should any questions relevant to this section arise.
SKETCHBOOKS
Sketchbooks will also serve as notebooks (for periodic lectures and readings in this course) are required and will be
reviewed by the instructor intermittently.
PHOTOGRAPHY
Photography will be an essential tool that will be used for initial site analysis, final presentation and most importantly for
daily documentation of your design progress.
