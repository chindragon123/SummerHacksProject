Description
This course explores historical and contemporary style in the African Diaspora. From
head to toe, runways to street corners, art installations to music videos, “dandyism” to
“swag,” Patrick Kelly to Virgil Abloh, we investigate the sartorial as a wearable art form
and a political arena. We unfurl the tapestry of desires that encircles black fashion in the
U.S. and globally, combing through the intertwined threads of passionate creativity,
sexual fetishization, corporeal autonomy, capitalism consumerism, suffocating
conformity and humorous play amongst other topics.
*Please Note:
1) This course carries a flag for Global Cultures.
Requirements & Assignments
1. Class Attendance: Each student is required to attend every class session. Attendance
will be noted. Unexcused absences are unacceptable. More than one unexcused absence
during the term will result in a reduction of the overall course grade for each session
missed (AàA-, B+àB, etc.).
*Note: The use of laptops, tablets and mobile phones in NOT permitted in the classroom
3. Informed participation: Each student is required to complete the assigned readings
and will bring hardcopies of these readings to class. Students will come to class on time
and prepared with questions and comments on each reading.
4. Reading Responses: A one-page reading response will be posted by 5pm on the
Monday before class. These posts are intended to provoke conversation. The week’s
assigned readings must be addressed directly, but no need to summarize. Critique,
compare, and pose questions for discussion or clarification. Each post must comment on
at least one other person’s reading response. The first reading response is due on
Monday 9/10 at 5pm. These responses will be graded on a credit/no credit basis. Students
will receive no credit for late posts.
5. Discussion facilitation: Each student will co-facilitate two class sessions. These
sessions will be assigned. Students may exchange dates, but must inform the professor of
this change at least one week prior to the facilitation. Facilitators are required to meet
                                                 1

with the instructor during office hours prior to each facilitation. Facilitators are expected
to draft questions and design activities for discussion based on the assigned readings and
are required to read the reading responses posted for that week. The inclusion of course-
relevant audio/visual material as a way to encourage conversation is highly encouraged.
Students will receive a grade for these facilitations. Discussion facilitators are NOT
required to write conversation pages for the week of their facilitation.
6. Final project proposal: Students will be assigned final project groups (shifts are
allowed between groups, but the professor must be informed of these changes at least one
week before the proposal is due) and write a 2-3 page proposal (12pt. Times New Roman
font, double spaced). This proposal will explain the form of the final project and the texts
the group will be using. These texts must include course related readings/films, but may
also include outside resources. This proposal will be accompanied by a briefly annotated
bibliography (the bibliography does NOT count toward the minimum page limit). Each
group member will receive the same grade.
7. Final project: Each group will complete a final project to be accompanied by a 4-5
page explanatory script (12pt. Times New Roman font, double spaced). The project will
be due on the first day of Final Exams. Each group member will receive the same grade.
   •   For the Final Project, groups will produce a creative work in the medium of their
       choice (performance, film, painting, sculpture, photography, literary text, web, etc.
       or using multiple media). This work MUST engage directly with texts/films
       assigned for the course and themes raised by the course. Outside sources are
       encouraged but not required.
Please note for all assignments:
* Late proposals and projects will be penalized for every day they are late (i.e. A à A-
if one day late, A à B+ if two days late, etc.). Students are required to proofread their
material prior to submission (ideally, someone else will also read the material for
grammatical/spelling/flow errors your eyes might miss). Materials that show evidence of
not having been proofread will be returned and marked late. Extensions may be
considered only under extenuating circumstances and in emergency situations. When
possible, advance notice is encouraged and documentation will be required.
* For assistance with cultivating your ideas, outlining your written work and tips on
proofreading/editing your polished writing, please make an appointment at the

Grading Schema
(Informed by “Grading Standards II” by Maxine Rodburg of the Harvard Writing Center)
The following are the standards I adhere to when I grade essays. Pluses and minuses
represent shades of difference, as do split grades (e.g. B-/C+). I assign grades on the
evidence of the essay submitted, not on effort or time spent.
A:      An excellent piece of writing (this is not the same as perfect). This is an
        ambitious, perceptive essay that grapples with interesting, complex ideas,
        responds discerningly to counter-arguments, and explores well-chosen evidence
        revealingly. The discussion enhances— rather than underscores— the reader’s
        and writer’s knowledge (it doesn’t simply repeat what has been discussed in
        class). There is a context for all the ideas; someone outside the class would be
        enriched, not confused, by reading the essay. Its beginning opens up— rather than
        flatly announces— its thesis. Its end is something more than a summary. The
        language is clean, precise, and often elegant. As a reader I feel surprised,
        delighted, changed. There’s something new here for me, something only the
        essay’s writer could have written and explored in this particular way. The writer’s
        stake in the material is obvious.
B:      This is a piece of writing that reaches high and achieves many of its aims. The
        ideas are solid and progressively explored but some thin patches require more
        analysis and/or some stray thoughts do not quite fit together well. The language is
                                                12

        generally clear and precise but occasionally not. The evidence is relevant, but
        there may be too little. The context for the evidence may not be sufficiently
        explored, so that I have to make some of the connections that the writer should
        have made clear for me.
        OR This is a piece of writing that does not reach as high than an ‘A’ essay, but
        thoroughly achieves its aims. This is a solid essay whose reasoning and argument
        may nonetheless be rather routine— in this case the limitation is conceptual.
C:      This is a piece of writing that has real problems in one of these areas: 1)
        conception (there is at least one main idea but it is obscure and hard to get to); 2)
        structure (the logic behind the ordering of the text is far from clear); 3) use of
        evidence (there is no evidence presented or that which is provided is weak and/or
        the connections among the ideas are unclear or without context; the text is
        plagued by generalizations and absent substantial proof); 4) language (the writing
        is awkward and generally stands in the way of comprehension). Overall, the essay
        may be repetitive, poorly organized, and/or superficial in its treatment of the
        subject matter. In addition, punctuation, spelling, grammar, citations, and
        transitions may be problems as well.
        OR This is an essay that largely summarizes any given text or other work (of art
        or analysis), but is written without too many major problems.
        OR This is an essay that is chiefly a personal reaction to something. This is
        perhaps well written, but there is scant engagement with course content or other
        scholarly material; it is mostly opinion.
D:      This is an essay that demonstrates very little effort to grapple seriously with the
        ideas it hopes to explore.
        OR This is a piece of writing that is extremely problematic in many of the areas
        mentioned above: conception, structure, use of evidence, language, etc.
        OR This is writing that does not come close to meeting the expectations of the
        assignment.
F:      This is a piece of writing that should most definitely be re-conceptualized and
        revised drastically so that it can be re-submitted if that option is available.
