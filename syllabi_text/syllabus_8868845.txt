         In this course we will study the daily life of people in Mesoamerica, from the earliest
inhabitants in the region to the myriad ways that Precolumbian life and archaeology affect the
lives of people today. We will examine production strategies, agriculture, cooking, household
life, burial practices, beautification, the life of children, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and many
other aspects of daily life. We will pay close attention to variation and continuities through
space and time in Mesoamerica, and between different Mesoamerican cultures. We will study
a variety of archaeological sites ranging from the small rural site of Chan in Belize, to the giant
city of Teotihuacan in Mexico, from Joya del Cerén (buried in volcanic ash) to Tenochtitlan
(buried under modern Mexico City), and many others. While we will study daily life as a worthy
object of study in and of itself, we will also examine the relationship between daily life and
broad political and economic patterns, including the formation of ranked societies, warfare, and
empire-building.
Goals of the course:
1.       To provide an introduction to daily life in ancient Mesoamerica.
2.       To increase student literacy in archaeology by creating an understanding of how
         archaeological evidence and theory are used in building models about life in the past.
3.       To learn about the role of material culture in everyday life, the economy, and politics in
         ancient Mesoamerica.
Students with disabilities: Any student with disabilities should talk to me as soon as possible so
that we may make arrangements that will make for a better learning experience and that will
allow the student to show his or her abilities fully.
Classroom rules:
1.       NO cellphones, laptops, newspapers, or calculators in class or during exams.
2.       You may not record lectures or take photographs during lecture. Recording of any of my
         lectures will be considered academic dishonesty and result in academic penalties for the
         students involved.
3.       Academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to University rules. We will talk about
         issues related to academic dishonesty in class.


Grading and other class policies: Successful completion of this course will require learning from
readings, lectures, Power Point presentations, in-class exercises, and film. Topics covered in the
readings and in the classroom will, at times, be entirely different. Graded materials for this
class consist of a short paper, an in-class presentation of your short paper, and three non-
cumulative exams. In addition, I will take attendance during the in-class presentations, and
attendance will be graded. I will provide instructions for the short paper early during the
semester.
         Due to privacy concerns, I will not give grades to students over the phone or via email.
         Students may discuss their exams with me individually. Students who request that I re-
grade their exams must present their request in writing. If I agree to re-grade their exam,
students should be aware that their grade might suffer if I find errors that I did not find on my
first grading. Therefore, students are advised to make sure they have specific reasons why their
grade should improve before they challenge their grade.
         I do not post lecture notes on the Internet. I may post PowerPoint presentations on
Canvas or another University-approved service. In addition, the audio of classes will be
recorded and made available by the University. I will provide more information about that as
soon as I have it.
Final grades will be calculated as follows:
1.       Short paper (3 to 4 pages long):       10%
2.       In-class presentation:                 10%
3.       Attendance during presentations:       10%
4.       Exam 1:                                20%
5.       Exam 2:                                25%
6.       Exam 3 (non-cumulative):               25%
Textbooks and other readings:
1.       Robin, Cynthia 2013 Everyday Life Matters: Maya Farmers at Chan. University Press of
         Florida. REQUIRED. Available at the University COOP.

Email rules:
1.       Email if you have a medical emergency that will prevent you from making it to an exam.
         No need to email if you will miss class, unless you miss more than two weeks of class
         due to a major emergency.
2.       Email me if you need to see me in office hours but you have a time conflict with a class.
         I will be glad to make an appointment. Otherwise, you may just show up during office
         hours.


3.     Email if I ask you to email me.
4.     Do not email to continue class discussion; please use office hours. Also, if you have a
       question about the material, please bring it up in class. Other students might benefit
       from it.
5.     Do not use email to turn in assignments or to send attachments unless I specifically ask
       you to do so.
