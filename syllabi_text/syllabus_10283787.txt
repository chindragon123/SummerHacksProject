Course Description
Geographically, linguistically, ethnically, and economically, China today is a land of diversity,
characterized by striking regional variations. Yet underlying this diversity is a shared cultural
heritage: a unifying set of historical, literary, and artistic traditions, philosophical and religious
ideas, political institutions, and a common writing system. This course introduces the study of
Chinese society and culture through an examination of the cultural unities and diversities,
continuities and discontinuities that comprise the historical development of Chinese civilization.
Lectures and discussion will examine key concepts from art, history, language, literature, and
thought that greatly shaped, and continue to influence Chinese cultural and geopolitical entities.
This course provides a foundation for continued study of Chinese history and society for students
who plan to go on to more specialized, upper-division courses including Chinese anthropology,
history, literature, sociology, economics, law, policy, international business, art history,
architecture, environmental science, and philosophy.
Course Goals
The primary learning goal for this course is to acquire a broad understanding of the historical
development of civilization in China. This course adopts a "hands on" approach by asking
students to consider primary historical evidence of both a textual and visual nature and current
case studies. Therefore, a second goal of this course is to develop one's ability to interpret texts
and images by considering such material within its particular cultural, social, and political
context. The ultimate goal of the course is to acquire a richer understanding of Chinese
civilization and to develop research skills that will facilitate continued study of and coursework
on China and East Asia.
