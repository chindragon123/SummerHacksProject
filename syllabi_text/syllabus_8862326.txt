Course Objectives
This is a TexasMedia cornerstone class and our objectives are simple – to transform you into
sponges. The outcome of this semester’s work will be to have you soak up as much information
from as many perspectives as possible across the worlds of communication, technology, and pop-
culture. The more you experience, the more flexible you are in your thinking, the smarter your
ideas become, the better job you’ll get, the sooner you’ll get the corner office, and so it goes…
Understand from this point on you are a super sponge that can never be too saturated.
Course Description
This class will immerse you in the many issues that comprise the advertising media industry today
on the road to fostering your sense of independence in media analysis and recommendation. In
here you will be put in the driver’s seat where you are personally responsible for creating great
media solutions. It is not enough to simply use your “I’m a media person” brain. You must think
about the various worlds in today’s communication, entertainment, and business environments
and attempt to craft ideas that bring these facets all together for your clients in just the right way.
Let’s face it. No matter how you look at it, this is a highly competitive field you have chosen. You
better know as much as possible about using media as a competitive tool in business because this
is what will show immediately how you think – and ultimately – make it happen for you. This
means you need to be able to view each scenario you’re dealing with from any of many angles.
This fluidity of thought is only one of the major things we will be working on.
Throughout the semester, you will be required to complete a number of different assignments
that focus on a wide variety of muscle groups in your brain. We will exercise you in large and small
group environments as well as individual experiences. You will read, write, and present. You will
also be exposed to quick response projects that mimic day-to-day industry demands as well as
longer-term projects that allow more in-depth research, analysis, and strategy development. Our
goal is to put you into as many different situations and push as many buttons as possible in 15
weeks that are both inside and well outside of your current comfort zones.


                       Warning: This is an extremely hands-on class.
                               Get ready to roll up your sleeves!
Course Design
This course has been designed as a seminar. That means that I don’t do all of the talking. Rather,
we have an ongoing exchange of ideas. Most class periods will be devoted to the discussion of
selected topics as indicated in your course schedule daily plan of attack. In-class activities will also
keep things lively. Throughout the semester, you will also be given class time to use as required
agency breakout sessions.
We will complete a variety of work over the next 15 weeks to exercise many different brain muscle
sets. Specific logistical details [deadlines and expectations] will be provided for each project at
the appropriate time. What follows is a top-line summary of the work we will take on this
semester. Please note, late work will be critiqued, but will receive a grade of 0.
         • You, Inc. - At the beginning of the course, you will be subdivided into small groups and
will be asked to pull together a quick, yet professional document and presentation that is meant
to jump start your semester while creating maximum sponge potential.
         • Client #1 & Client #2 Insight & Communication Decks/Presentations – We will work on
developing your sense of business as well as of strategy and content development via two very
real clients on extremely diverse projects. As always, this semester will include a unique
competitive twist for your teams. You will be doing everything from a full digital media presence
analysis, to creating media platforms portfolios that center on all mass and niche media, including
social, mobile, guerilla, and PR efforts. You will be exposed to new resources and skill sets
throughout this process. We will conduct all of this work under very strict non-disclosure
agreements, so please take this seriously.
         • POVs – Because it is critical that you work on your individual writing skills and on
developing/supporting your own opinion, you will have the opportunity to write two concise Point
of View statements in assignments mimicked after real industry experiences. You will also be
asked to discuss your opinions and justifications in class on the due date.
         • What Now? - From time-to-time we will have in-class small group work sessions. These
impromptu assignments will stem directly from other discussions in the class, and are meant to
replicate the quick thinking needed to successfully support a company’s need to make in-the-
moment decisions. You must be present by signing the daily roster to get credit for these sessions
and there are no make-ups if you miss class on these days.
         • Peer Rating – Because team work is such a huge requirement in our industry, each
student will be given a detailed peer review at the end of each group project. A student’s
combined reviews throughout the semester will be used to generate their individual peer rating
for the semester. Please note, a student earning below an acceptable rating on their peer reviews
is in danger of not being able to continue in TexasMedia courses in future semesters. In other
words, you are here because you want to be. If your performance indicates differently, this is
evidence that the program is not for you.


         • Regular Attendance - Yes, I’m one of those instructors who actually expects you to
attend class and to interact with us while you’re there. The reason for this is that our course is so
discussion and project based that you have to be present to grow with us. I will take role via a
sign in sheet each day and not being present will affect your grade. You must sign the roster
each day for yourself (no friend sign ins) to get recorded for attending. I will remind you, but I
cannot be asked to “remember” you being there. The sign-in sheet is the final say. Because life
happens, two absences are excused. Each additional absence is a 5% deduction.
Course Materials
Most of the materials you will need for this course will be provided on-line via Canvas.
You will also be responsible for covering the costs associated with producing materials for all of
your class assignments and presentations. Some semesters this will include any small costs that
are incurred for travel to and from client presentations.
You will also be required to sign up for free email updates from two of the following providers of
your choice and to regularly check the headlines to stay current:
Media Post - https://www.mediapost.com/register/
AdWeek - http://www.adweek.com/newsletter-signup
Ad Age - http://adage.com/help/emailprefs
PR News - http://www.prnewsonline.com/
Media Life Magazine - http://www.medialifemagazine.com/subscribe/
Online Wall Street Journal - http://online.wsj.com/news/technology
Communications
We will communicate regularly using the Canvas site for this class at http://courses.utexas.edu. I
will also be glad to have conversations with you via email, but will utilize a guaranteed 48-hour
return email policy due to the heavy volume of emails at certain times of the semester. I will not
be able to use email to answer your questions regarding projects or other detailed coursework
because such questions are best addressed in a person before or after class or during office
hours.
Grades
Grades will be handed back with feedback in class per our schedule. Canvas will be used to post
final course grades. Grades will be assigned based on the following distribution.
Client #1                              25%
Client #2                              30%
You, Inc.                              15%
POVs                                   10%
Peer Rating                            10%

                                       100%


We are under the system of +/-. The following scale will be used to determine the general breaks for
final grades.

University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of the University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold
these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
University of Texas Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
To make sure we are all on the same page, the following details UT’s policy on academic
integrity:
“Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University,
policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information please visit the
Student Judicial Services Web site: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs.”
What does this policy mean to you in this class? If you are caught cheating in any manner
[including plagiarizing work in your project], you will be significantly reprimanded in a manner that
correlates with the severity of the problem. This can range from being required to repeat the
course, to expulsion from the University. Please take this as seriously as we do!
