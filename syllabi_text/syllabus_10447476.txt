1.      Course Description
      This course provides students with a comprehensive introduction to data science for
the political and economic world. By focusing on practical data skills coupled with strong
social science reasoning, the course will enable students to acquire skills that will help them
prepare for jobs in data science, industry, and academia. Organized around a set of substan-
tive themes and practical tasks, each class topic is motivated by real-world problems and
then backed with data science skills to solve those problems. Emphasis is placed on devel-
oping proficiency in cleaning, manipulating, wrangling, scraping, visualizing, and mapping
data. Most work is conducted in the software programs R and Excel, and to a lesser extent
through introductory exercises in other programs. In the process, students learn about good
principles of working with data, including through version control with Github. The class
takes place through asynchronous instruction, online coding practice problems, exams, and
online instructor consultations.
      Learning data science skills can be tedious at times, especially as students learn the
basics of the programming languages and basic data management. Once proficient, however,
we expect that students will be able to develop a set of concrete skills that they can use in
internships or jobs. Those skills include: basic analysis of statistical data, visualization of
statistical data and relationships, maps of geospatial data, graphical dashboards to display
data, webscraping, and text analysis.

2.       Course Requirements
2.1.      Prerequisite Coursework
      There are no prerequisites to enroll in this course. We will work at a speed so that
everyone should be able to adequately learn the materials if they do not miss class or required
assignments. However, students who have previous knowledge of basic statistics and/or
computer programming may find the course easier.
2.2.      Required Computer Hardware, Software, and Resources
      Since this is an asynchronous course, it is necessary to have a working computer with an
internet connection (minimum 5 Mbps) and a modern and updated operating system (e.g.,
MacOS or Windows). With regard to an internet browser, we highly recommend Chrome,
though Safari or Firefox may work for most activities. In addition, this course makes use of
the following software programs:
    • Excel. Students who do not already have Excel on their computers may obtain the full
       Microsoft Office Suite, including Excel, for $19.99 at through the Campus Computer
       Store. Note that Google Sheets cannot be used as a substitute for Excel.
    • Google Sheets. Students can use Google Sheets for free through their utexas email
       accounts.
    • R. It is a free, open-source statistics and data science program. To install R, see here.
    • R Studio is a companion program for R. For instructions on how to freely download
       R Studio, consult here.
    • Git. It is the program underlying most version control—i.e., a system of tracking file
       tracking that facilitates collaboration. For instructions on how to freely install Git,
       consult here.
    • GitHub. It is an online platform that facilitates version control through Git. To use
       GitHub, students need to create a free Github student account.
    • Git Bash. Only students who use Microsoft Windows for their operating system will
       need to download and install Git Bash. Mac users can directly use the Shell (command
       line) and do not need to install Git Bash.
      Prior knowledge of any of these software programs/platforms is not required. We will
teach you the basics of all of these programs during the course. To obtain help with these
programs and others, there are two resources that we will utilize:
    • Data Camp. It is an online platform that provides hundreds of courses to learn new
       skills. The courses are interactive and fun. We will be using some of these courses from
       Data Camp as required homework. We will be providing free access to Data Camp.
    • Lynda. You can also access free courses through UT-Austin’s Lynda Portal.

2.4.     Grading
    • Attendance: 10%
         – Attendance will be verified with in-lecture polls. We will simply be giving credit
            for legitimate responses. There will be no penalty for wrong answers, providing
            that the wrong answers represent legitimate attempts to answer the polls.
    • Homework: 35%
         – Homework will take place entirely over Data Camp. We will be providing grades
            based on the Data Camp points that students accumulate in each assignment.
            Note that you lose points for taking hints, so it is necessary to pay attention
            when completing the assignments.
    • Exams: 55%
         – 1st Exam: 15% (June 15 evening [4 hour window for 2 hour exam])
         – 2nd Exam: 20% (June 26 evening [4 hour window for 2 hour exam])
         – 3rd Exam: 20% (July 9 evening [4 hour window for 2 hour exam])
2.5.     Grading Scale
         •  92.50-100 (A)          •  72.50-76.49 (C)
         •  92.49-89.50 (A-)       •  69.50-72.49 (C-)

2.7.      Grade Posting on Canvas
      We will post all grades to the class website, Canvas. We will also use the option where
students may discern the average score of the class. This way, students will know where they
stand by the end of semester.
2.8.      Grade Appeals
      If students would like to appeal their grade on any assignment, it is necessary make the
request to both professors in writing, over email, within 5 days of receiving the grade. In
the grade appeal, students must specify the reason(s) why we may have misgraded the as-
signment. Acceptable reasons include those pertaining to the concepts and material covered
during the course. We will not consider requests for grade changes that are not germane to
the course.
2.9.      Late Work
      Unless you receive prior approval from either professor, we will discount all late work
as follows:
    • 1-15 minutes: 0% (grace period for last-minute issues)
    • 15 minutes-24 hours late: -10%
    • 24-48 hours late: -25%
    • more than 2 days late: -50%
    • more than one week: no credit offered
2.10.      Students Rights and Responsibilities

       shall be isolated, excluded or diminished in any way.
With these rights come these responsibilities:
    • You are responsible for taking care of yourself, managing your time, and communicating
       with the instructor if things start to feel out of control or overwhelming.
                                                 4


Prof. Mike Findley & Mike Denly                     Data Science for the Social World (Summer 2020)
    • You are responsible for acting in a way that is worthy of respect and always respectful
       of others.
2.11.      Personal Pronoun and Name Preferences
      Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals
and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation,
gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with
the student’s legal name. We will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate
name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that
we may make appropriate changes to my records.
2.12.      Academic Integrity
      Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
“As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of
the University and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT.
Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous
class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject
to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code, which can be found
at the following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint student.php
2.13.      Drop Policy
      Under Texas law, students are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any
public Texas institution. For more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/
2.14.      University Resources for Students
      Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because
we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning
or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to
meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. There are also a range of resources
on campus:
2.14.1.     Services for Students with Disabilities
      This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities.
If there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you
have medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements
in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an
effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs
with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions.

2.14.2.    Counseling and Mental Health Center
      Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
      All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are
many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience
is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
      If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feel-
ings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support:

      The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of
Campus Safety and Security (512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/):
    • Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
       evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
       requires exiting and assembling outside.
    • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
       Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
       building.
