                     Foundations of Social Justice: Values, Diversity, Power & Oppression
I. STANDARIZED COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course is based the following assumptions: 1.) membership in a population-at-risk group (e.g., people of
color, women, gay and lesbian persons) significantly influences an individual’s life experiences, world view, and
increases risk factors for exposure to discrimination, economic deprivation, and oppression; 2.) professional social
work ethics and values demand culturally competent practices; 3.) it is necessary for students to learn to apply
social justice approaches to influence assessment, planning, access to resources, intervention, and research; and
4.) professionals and programs have strategies to critically analyze distributive justice, human and civil rights, and
global interconnections of oppression. There is an emphasis in this course on the impact of discrimination and
oppression by individuals and society on people of culturally diverse backgrounds and orientations. This course
carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity courses are designed to increase
your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least
one U.S. cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalization.
II. COURSE OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this course students will be able to:
1.) Critique and apply culturally competent and social justice approaches to influence assessment, planning,
access to resources, intervention, and research;
2.) Demonstrate familiarity with the history and heritage of population-at-risk groups, including women and
culturally diverse populations globally, as well as those prevalent in the southwestern region of the United States;
3.) Understand the social construction of race and ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation;
4.) Examine the personal and professional use of self in ethical, culturally competent, and socially just social
work practices and,
5.) Assess the impact of discrimination (e.g. racism, sexism, homophobia) and oppression on public policy,
institutional structure, service delivery, and one's own role in promoting social and economic justice.
EPAS Competencies
The Steve Hicks School of Social Work has been continuously accredited by the Council on Social Work
Education (CSWE) since 1952. In order to maintain our accreditation status, the UT SHSSW engages in ongoing
curriculum assessment to demonstrate compliance with CSWE’s Education Policies and Accreditation Standards
(EPAS).
Using a common evaluation instrument, this course measures the implementation of knowledge, skills, values,
and/or cognitive and affective processes to assess the following competencies:
                                                            1

environmental justice to advocate for human rights at the individual and system levels
Outcome 3.2: Responses demonstrate an ability to engage in practices that advance social, economic, and
environmental justice
III. TEACHING METHODS
Teaching involves a partnership between the instructor and the student in a collaborative and passionate
commitment to the mutual learning process. My philosophy of teaching is to provide students with relevant
content in the form of presentation, text, and instructional activities that assist students in the integration of the
material. Within the field of social work, content delivered without its applicability to micro and macro level
practice is irrelevant to the student that gravitates to the profession to be an agent of social change. Essentially, as
an instructor I see my role as 1.) creating a safe learning environment that 2.) allows for the sharing of ideas, in-
depth critical analysis and integration of the material.

Personal Background Paper: (20 Points)
June 24th
This paper will be confidential and only the instructor will read it.
For this paper, each student should interview an older family member to explore your family’s ethnic background.
The student should ask their family member to tell them about their family history. What nations or continents are
part of your heritage (e.g., China, Africa, Italy, Germany)? What are your family values? How does your family
negotiate identity within multiple cultures? Do family members often interact with members of other cultural
groups? What are your family’s biases about other cultural groups?
Once the interview is completed, write a 4 to 5 paper (double spaced paper with 1-inch margins and 12-point
times new roman font). Each page must be fully covered. In order to protect confidentiality, use codenames for
yourself and your family members. The paper structure is outlined below. Use this outline in your paper:
I. Introduction:
   a) Briefly describe how you identify yourself today and have done so at different times of your life in terms of
   racial background, age, social economic status, nationality, country of residence, cultural background and any
   information you find to be important in describing who you are (approximately 1 paragraph).
   b) Briefly describe what you know about your family’s background with special emphasis on what you learned
   during your interview. Compare experiences between different family generations, how your views differ or
   concur with your family members, and how behavior norms are taught from one generation to the next
   (approximately 1 page).
II. Your Family on the Continuum of Privilege and Oppression
This section should be the bulk of the paper. Here you will reflect upon your family history and identify where
your family is located on a continuum between privilege and oppression. In what circumstances has your family
experienced privilege? What did that feel like? In what circumstances have you and your family experienced
oppression (either being oppressed or oppressing others)? What did that feel like? (approximately 2 pages)
III. Conclusion
This section will be a brief summary of the main things you learned about yourself and your family. Examine the
meaning of your family background to your social work practice and identify which cultural groups you know a
lot about, which cultural groups you do not know much about and what types of clients you might feel
comfortable and uncomfortable serving (approximately 1 page)
                                                          3


Intersectionality Paper: (30 Points)
July 15th
For this paper, each student should interview someone who has a social identity that is different from the student
in two areas: 1) race/ethnicity and 2) another dimension of intersectionality (e.g., nationality, gender identity,
sexual orientation, disability/ability, class, immigration status, or religion). The student will also conduct a
literature review related to both aspects of the interviewee’s identity. Write a paper 6 to 9 pages (double spaced
with 1-inch margins and 12-point times new roman font). Title page and references are not included in the
required page count. Cite the literature you draw from using APA style (You can use articles from the course, but
a minimum of 3 references should be from other sources). Each page must be fully covered. In order to protect
confidentiality, use codenames for your interviewee. In addition to a title page and references, the paper structure
is outlined below. Use this outline in your paper:
I: Interview
Provide a written summary of the interview. It does not have to be verbatim. Just list the questions and the
interviewee’s response following the question. In this paper, you are asked to interview someone of a different
social identity. Ask the questions from the topic areas that corresponds to your interviewee’s identity (the list of
questions can be found in CANVAS). These are starter interview questions additional questions should be added
by the student and included in the paper. Before you begin your interview, remember to inform your interviewee
that their participation is voluntary, that they can refuse to answer any or all questions, and their identity will be
kept confidential. Again, be sure to omit any identifying information from your paper. Please keep to this page
limit. You may have to omit some questions from your paper. Provide a summary of questions and answers that
you found most important, compelling, or interesting. (This should be 2 to 3 pages)
II: Literature Review
Write a brief literature review on your interviewee’s member group (e.g., if you interviewed a lesbian woman,
find articles on lesbian women. Review at least 5 current scholarly sources (written within the past 5 years). A
literature review is a synthesis of the common themes or inconsistencies among the literature you read. It is not
just a summary of the literature, but a critical analysis of how the articles cover the subject matter. (This should be
2 to 3 pages)
III. Findings
Compare and contrast your interviewee’s experience with what you found in the literature. Develop tentative
conclusions regarding how social workers can best assist persons from your respondent’s group based on a critical
analysis of the interview, scholarly sources, and your own thinking/experience. (This should be 2 to 3 pages)
Race/Ethnicity Presentations: (20 Points)
July 22nd
     •   The class will be divided into six groups. Each group will cover one topic.
     •   Group presentations should be 30 minutes with an additional 5-10 minutes of class discussion.
     •   PowerPoints for all groups are due on July 22nd
     •   In-class presentations will begin week on July 22nd

                                                             4


     •    Jewish Descent
     •    Middle Eastern Descent
Groups are expected to provide a summary of the readings related to the topic that is listed on the syllabus and at
least one new article published within the last 5 years. Groups are encouraged to use short video clips in their
presentations. The group will present the main points of the articles in a 10-15 slide PowerPoint presentation.
Short Answers Exam: (15 Points)
July 25th
Students will provide answers to ten exam questions (at least one paragraph per question). The questions will
cover multiple themes discussed during the course (including but not limited to implicit bias, cultural relativism,
ethnocentrism, cultural competence, and cultural humility).
Participation: (10 Points)
The richness of the learning process is enhanced by the participation of all members of the class. Participation will
be assessed by attendance as well as oral comments and questions during class. Each absence will result in a
reduction of one point for the participation grade. Three late arrivals or early departure equal one absence. Three
or more absences will result in a one letter grade reduction in your final grade. It is your responsibility to sign the
weekly attendance sheet.
VI. GRADES

VII. CLASS POLICIES
    1. Social work students adhere to the Student Standards for Professional Conduct of the NASW Code of
         Ethics and assume responsibility for their conduct. Scholastic honesty and integrity are to be consistent
         social work values.
    2. The instructor will comply with University guidelines regarding scholastic dishonesty, including
         plagiarism.
    3. Social work practitioners respect others. Therefore, differences in values, opinions, and feelings of class
         members and guest speakers will be respected.
    4. Punctuality and timeliness are important for social work practitioners. Class attendance is expected. Each
         absence will result in a reduction of one point for the participation grade. Three late arrivals or early
         departure equal one absence. Three or more absences will result in a one letter grade reduction in your
         final grade. It is your responsibility to sign the weekly attendance sheet.
    5. The instructor should be notified in advance of any planned absence and as soon as possible in the case of
         an unforeseen, serious emergency.
    6. Students are expected to be active in the learning process, to do the assigned readings and participate in
         the class activities and discussions. If you do not have a personal computer with Internet access, there are
         computers available for your use at the SW Learning Resource Center (LRC), the Flawn Academic
         Center, campus, and public libraries.
    7. Assignments should be turned in at the beginning of class on the date they are due, barring serious,
         unforeseen medical illness or family emergencies. Late assignments will not be accepted.
    8. The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association Sixth Edition (APA) is the style
         manual to be used by all students. The manual is available at the library or for purchase at the Co-op.
VIII. UNIVERSITY POLICIES
The University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through
integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Professional Conduct and Civility in the Classroom
The professor expects students to act as professionals in class. This means students should arrive on time for
class, be prepared to participate in the class discussion, and show respect for one another’s opinions. A course
brings together a group of diverse individuals with various backgrounds. Students are influenced and shaped by
such factors as ethnicity, gender, sex, physical abilities, religious and political beliefs, national origins, and sexual
orientations, among others. We expect to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and
mutual respect. Social Work also deals with complex and controversial issues. These issues may be challenging
and uncomfortable, and it would be impossible to offer a substantive classroom experience that did not include
potentially difficult conversations relating to challenging issues. In this environment we will be exposed to
diverse ideas and opinions, and sometimes we will not agree with the ideas expressed by others. Nevertheless, the
professor requires that students engage one another with civility, respect, and professionalism.
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such dishonesty harms the
individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. For further information, the student may refer to the Web Site of the Student Judicial Services, Office of
the Dean of Students (http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/).
                                                             6


Documented Disability Statement
Any student who requires special accommodations must obtain a letter that documents the disability from the
Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement (471-6259
voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). Present the letter to the professor at the
beginning of the semester so that needed accommodations can be discussed. The student should remind the
professor of any testing accommodations no later than five business days before an exam. For more information,
visit http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/.
Religious Holidays
By UT Austin policy, students must notify the professor of a pending absence at least 14 days prior to the date of
observance of a religious holy day. If the student must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a
project in order to observe a religious holy day, the professor will give the student an opportunity to complete the
missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Title IX Reporting Policy
In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the University of Texas at Austin is
committed to maintaining a learning environment that is free from discriminatory conduct based on gender.
Faculty, field instructors, staff, and/or teaching assistants in their supervisory roles are mandated reporters of
incidents of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual violence, stalking, interpersonal violence, or any other
forms of sexual misconduct. Students who report such incidents will be informed of University resources.
Incidents will be reported to the University’s Title IX Coordinator and/or the Title IX Liaison for the SHSSW,
Professor Tanya Voss. Students, faculty and staff may contact Professor Voss to report incidents or to obtain
information. Further information, including student resources related to Title IX, may also be found at
http://socialwork.utexas.edu/dl/files/academic-programs/other/qrg-sexualharassment.pdf.
Policy on Social Media and Professional Communication
Public social networks are not private. Even when open only to approved or invited members, users cannot be
certain that privacy will exist among the general membership of sites. If social work students choose to participate
in such forums, please assume that anything posted can be seen, read, and critiqued. What is said, posted, linked
to, commented on, uploaded, subscribed to, etc., can be accessed and archived, posing potential harm to
professional reputations and prospective careers.
Social work students who use social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and other forms of electronic
communication (e.g. blogs) must be mindful of how their communication may be perceived by clients, colleagues,
faculty, and others. Social work students are expected to make every effort to minimize material which could be
considered inappropriate for a professional social worker in training. Because of this, social work students are
advised to manage security settings at their most private levels and avoid posting information/photos or using any
language that could jeopardize their professional image.
Students are asked to consider the amount of personal information posted on these sites and are obliged to block
any client access to involvement in the students’ social networks. Client material should not be referred to in any
form of electronic media, including any information that might lead to the identification of a client or compromise
client confidentiality in any way. Additionally, students must critically evaluate any material that is posted
regarding community agencies and professional relationships, as certain material could violate the standards set
by the School of Social Work, the Texas Code of Conduct for Social Workers, and/or the NASW Code of Ethics.
Social work students should consider that they will be representing professional social work practice as well as
The University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work program while in the classroom, the university
community, and the broader area communities.
                                                             7


Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students
Email is recognized as an official mode of university correspondence; therefore, students are responsible for
reading their email for university and course-related information and announcements. Students are responsible to
keep the university informed about changes to their e-mail address. Students should check their e-mail regularly
and frequently—daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related communications,
some of which may be time-sensitive. Students can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating their
e-mail address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.php.
Safety
As part of professional social work education, students may have assignments that involve working in agency
settings and/or the community. As such, these assignments may present some risks. Sound choices and caution
may lower risks inherent to the profession. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of and adhere to policies
and practices related to agency and/or community safety. Students should notify the professor regarding any
safety concerns.
Unanticipated Distress
Students may experience unexpected and/or distressing reactions to course readings, videos, conversations, and
assignments. If so, students are encouraged to inform the professor. The professor can be responsive and
supportive regarding students’ participation in course assignments and activities, but students are responsible for
communicating clearly what kind of support is desired. If counseling is needed, students may contact a service
provider of their choosing, including the UT Counseling Center at 512-471-3515 or online at
https://cmhc.utexas.edu/.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If students are worried about someone who is acting differently, they may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line
to discuss by phone their concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a
partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the
Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-
5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside when a fire alarm
is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following policies regarding evacuation:
     • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest exit
         door may not be the one you used when you entered the building.
     • If you require assistance to evacuate, inform the professor in writing during the
         first week of class.
     • In the event of an evacuation, follow the professor’s instructions.
     • Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire
         Department, the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services
         office.
