Class Essentials
Read Carefully: Your modules are due on the date and time specified on the syllabus. Please be aware
that for the work to be graded, you need to submit your answers via Canvas. We will not accept late

email gatewaytechsupport@austin.utexas.edu and cc your professor and TA. This address is staffed
during normal business hours, so please do not wait to the last minute to submit your work. We are not
responsible for technical errors related to your individual equipment (e.g. home wi-fi or laptop) and
such problems are not grounds for an extension of the due date.
To ensure that you have completed the entire module and all your work was submitted, please check
the table of contents page for your module. Completed items will display a green check mark next to
them. Always access your modules through the course homepage or the Assignments tab in Canvas.
Accessing your module through the Grade tab provides a read-only view of your work.
Extra credit opportunities: In most class sessions, you will have an opportunity to respond to
questions and earn extra credit. To respond to these questions, you must bring an internet connected
device - a smart phone, a tablet, or laptop - to class and connect to our class in Canvas.

your written work, but is a valuable resource who can help you succeed in this class by improving your
writing and study skills.

 information, visit the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at:

 The online course format allows us to monitor and detect issues involving identity

notifications when any problematic behaviors are detected. These emails are intended mainly
to remind students of the course code of conduct, and carry absolutely no implications for a    S
student’s grade in this course. We will only investigate cases where our system determines
that there is a considerable amount of evidence that the code of conduct is not being followed.
Regardless of the results, the faculty member, in consultation with Student Judicial Services,
will make the final determination as to whether or not a paper has been plagiarized.
Students with Disabilities
Upon request, the University of Texas at Austin provides appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students. It is the student’s responsibility, to make the
instructor aware of any special accommodations or needs in a timely manner. Students with
disabilities may request appropriate accommodations from the Services for Students with
Disabilities at 512-471-6259 (audio) or 512-232-2937 (audiovisual) or
http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/how-to-register-with-ssd/. As soon as you have
received your letter of accommodation, please send a scanned copy to your professor.
Religious Holidays
The instructor complies with University policy regarding religious holidays. Students must
inform the instructor at least 14 days prior to any assignments that they will miss. Students
will be given a reasonable time to make up any items. It remains the student’s responsibility
to complete the modules in a timely fashion.
This course may be used to fulfill three hours of the U.S. history part of the university core
curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by the Texas Higher
Education Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking skills, personal
responsibility, and social responsibility. This course carries a cultural diversity flag.
Geographical Literacy
This class will participate in a new History department initiative to improve student
geographical literacy. Geographical literacy helps us to deepen our understanding of
the complex processes of the past when we have a better grasp of time, space and
place. You will do a series of map exercises this semester that reinforce your key
conceptual issues and content knowledge, and you will access those exercises through
Canvas.
