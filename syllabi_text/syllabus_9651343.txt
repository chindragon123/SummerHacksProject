Description
This course discusses the evidence-based practices that can be used to teach students with or
at risk for learning disabilities. We will read and interpret empirical research and learn how to
apply findings from the literature base in school settings.
Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will:
    1. Understand the fundamentals of statistics that show evidence of efficacy or
         effectiveness for a particular instructional program or teaching practice
    2. Identify evidence-based practices in reading, writing, and mathematics based on a
         review of the empirical research literature.
    3. Apply evidence-based practices in school settings.
Instructional Methods
This course combines online and in-class discussions and assignments. In-class discussions and
assignments will take place on the campus of The University of Texas. Online discussions and
assignments will be held in asynchronous formats.
Course Text
None. All readings posted on Canvas.

Assignment Descriptions
Quizzes:
Four quizzes will be administered during the course. During each quiz administration, students
will be able to access and use course material. Quizzes are designed to encourage higher order
thinking about the in-class discussions and selected course readings.
Annotated Bibliographies #1 and #2:
For each assignment, you will write an annotated bibliography focused on one research study
identified by the instructor. A template for completing the assignments will be provided and
posted on Canvas.
Annotated Bibliography #3:
You will write an annotated bibliography based on four articles that you locate and identify in a
literature search. Your annotated bibliography must focus on a particular population (e.g.,
students with learning disabilities in mathematics or reading) and potential area of intervention
(e.g., early mathematics instruction). The bibliography has to include research studies designed
to answer causal questions (group design studies). This assignment is designed to give you
experience grappling with the content and design of existing research so that in the future you
can determine the extent to which resources in schools align with findings from rigorous
educational studies and the implications of those findings. This assignment can be completed
individually or with a partner. A template for completing the assignment and explicit directions
for completing the literature search will be provided and posted on Canvas.
Final Presentation:
You will provide a brief oral presentation on the findings of Annotated Bibliography #3. Your
presentation will share your search procedures used to locate the studies, the focus of the
identified studies, and similarities of and differences of the studies. A template for completing
the assignments will be provided and posted on Canvas.

Course Policies
1. PDS Reminder. This course is a requirement for the Professional Development Sequence this
semester, and as such, according to College of Education policy, must be completed and passed
with a grade of “C” or better. A student cannot proceed into the next semester, if any grades in
the PDS coursework are below a “C” or are incomplete. Therefore, all of the requirements for
this class must be turned in for a grade by the end of the semester.
2. Laptops or tablets brought to class should be used for course purposes only. Cell phones
should be used for emergency calls only.
3. All written assignments must be prepared in a “professional” manner. “Professional” is
defined as being appropriate for classroom, community, and administrative uses, and includes
both appearance and the use of language that is acceptably formal, behavioral and person-first
language. All assignments must be typed, unless directed by instructor.
4. Scholastic dishonesty will not be tolerated, and incidents of dishonesty will be reported. If
plagiarism of written work is evident, you will receive a “0” on that assignment and may receive
a failing grade for the course. Please refer to University policy regarding Academic Dishonesty in
the General Information Catalogue.
5. Students who miss more than 1 course session receive a failing grade for the course and
must take the course again during a different semester.
6. Class begins at 10:00am. If you are going to be late and/or miss class, text or email your
instructor.
