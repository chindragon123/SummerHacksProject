Description: This course will explore how biography—whether individual or group—can
aid us in understanding the history of the built environment. We will examine various
models for writing architectural biographies and investigate research strategies and
methods. This class is especially appropriate for this who might be contemplating a career
that involves writing about architecture.
Course Requirements: Class attendance is required. Grades will be based on class
participation (60%), and a final research paper (40%). Plus/minus grading will be used for
this course.
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom,
leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is
expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect
toward peers and community. Cheating and plagiarism (using another person's words
or ideas without proper attribution) are serious academic offenses and may result in a
failing grade or expulsion from the university! If you are unsure about what constitutes
plagiarism or have questions about how to employ source material in your papers, please
consult with me. You may discuss your papers with your friends—and I encourage you
to do so—but remember that the work you submit must be your own. If you have
questions concerning these issues, please see the link to the University Honor Code:
