Course Objectives
Theories of architecture provide frameworks for architectural practice and for relating
practice to society. This discussion-based course is intended to help you anchor your own
positions in contemporary discourse by examining seminal texts that have shaped
architectural thought in the West.
Course materials
Pdf files for all reading assignments are available on the course Canvas site.
Assignments and Evaluation
Position papers and drawing assignment
40% of final grade
Due as indicated on the schedule of classes below, the position papers are intended to
help you focus your thoughts about the readings and to provide a basis for discussion.
You may submit your papers on Canvas or as hard copies. Each essay should be two to
three pages long (double-spaced, 12-point type) and address one or more issues drawn
from the readings. You may express support or disagreement with the authors’ positions,
comment on the subject matter, or otherwise relate it to something you’ve encountered
elsewhere in your experience. It is not necessary to devote equal space to each of the
readings, but you should mention all of them.


                                                                                          2
Drawing assignment due on Wednesday, 19 September
Using a module of 1” for the base of the columns, construct the Doric, Ionic, and
Corinthian orders. At a larger scale of your choosing, develop the capital and entablature
(architrave, frieze, and cornice) of one of them. Construct them; don’t trace. The point of
the exercise is to gain first-hand understanding of their underlying proportions.
•   Set the bases on a common datum line (this will allow you to compare their
     proportions)
•   Do not add pedestals
•   Include the entablatures (architrave, frieze, cornice)
•   Try to draw entasis on at least one column
•   Pay particular attention to how part relates to part
I’ll evaluate the drawings on a pass/fail basis with full credit awarded for reasonable
effort.
A helpful guide for this exercise is William R. Ware, The American Vignola: A Guide to
the Making of Classical Architecture (first published 1902, reprint New York: Norton,
1977). A copy is available on Canvas.
Phenomenological analysis
20% of final grade
Due on Wednesday, 24 October
Based on your understanding of phenomenology drawn from the readings, conduct an
analysis of a designed landscape, urban form, or building (exterior or interior) that
considers the notion of place and is not limited to visual impressions. Your essay should
be about three pages long (double-spaced, 12-point type, plus illustrations as needed).
The analysis should be framed by an introduction explaining your approach and a
conclusion in which you step back and ask “so what?”
Term paper
40% of final grade
Due on Monday, 10 December
•   Project statement (one page, plus preliminary bibliography) due Wednesday, 8
     November
•   Workshop on Wednesday, 28 November
The purpose of this paper is to challenge you to develop a topic related to the course in
greater depth than possible in the position papers. You may address a theme that we have
examined, building on your position papers, or take on another aspect of architectural
theory of interest to you. You may address work you are doing in studio or another
course. Your text should be about ten pages long (double-spaced, 12-point type) plus
notes, bibliography, and illustrations. Please feel free to consult with me as you weigh
your options for a topic. Our workshop session on 28 November will be an opportunity to
share your interests and receive feedback from the other members of the class.


                                                                                            3
Evaluation
My standards regarding grades are as follows: A represents exemplary work in which the
student has successfully realized his or her stated objectives in terms of content and style;
B has a broader compass in which the intentions of the assignment are met adequately but
with some weakness of content or style or reticence in approach; C recognizes effort but
acknowledges serious problems in content or style; D and F reflect a fundamental lack of
effort. I use plus and minus grades.
I will give consideration to sustained improvement and consistent engagement with
readings and discussions. I reserve the prerogative to not accept late work. Regular
attendance is expected and multiple unexcused absences will be factored in the final
grade. Incompletes will be given only in cases of illness or other personal emergencies.
Accommodation for religious holidays
University policy requires notice of a planned absence at least fourteen days prior to the
date of observance of a religious holy day. If you miss a class or an assignment in order
to observe a religious holy day, you will be given the opportunity to complete the work
within a reasonable time after the absence.
