UID​: 20900                              Instructor:​ Tyler Coleman ​Office Hours: ​T/TH 12:30-2
Meetings​: T/TH 11-12:30
Location​: DFA 4.106
Abstract
        An introduction to game scripting using Unity and C#. This course will cover a variety of
        scripting techniques for game systems including combat, multiplayer, saving and loading,
        menus, and managers. Students will also be introduced to coding best practices such as
        commenting, encapsulation, and object-oriented programming.
Outcomes
        Upon successful completion of the course, students will have a working understanding of
        scripting in the context of an industry-standard game engine, as well as the role a Game
        Scripter plays on a team and within a company. Students will also be comfortable solving
        problems using code, and will have experience creating functional systems including:
        combat, save points, persistent game data, quests, and multiplayer. On top of scripting
        the gameplay, students will also master integrating their scripts within the game engine to
        create a fully playable experience including art, sound, animation, vfx, and UI.
Assessment
        Six homework assignments are equally weighted toward 60% of the final class grade, 10%
        each. The final project will be worth 25% and will be graded based on the provided rubric.
        The remaining 15% will be based on attendance and professionalism. Assignments are
        due by the start of class on the due date. A bonus opportunity to publish your final project
        will be worth 5% of the final grade.
        No late work will be accepted. No incompletes will be given. If you feel you will not be
        able to complete all work on time, you should ask the instructor for a grade of Q or drop
        before the deadline for doing so passes.
        Note: If you cannot attend class for any reason, please send an email and attach any
        class work as needed, and talk to your classmates to find out what you missed.

Grades
Homework Assignments: 60%
Attendance and Professionalism: 15%
Final: 25%
Bonus: 5%
Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric. Please note: to ensure
fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B-
will
be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not recognize the grade
of A+.
A = 94-100
A- = 90-93
B+ = 87-89
B = 84-86
B- = 80-83


C+ = 77-79
C = 74-76
C- = 70-73
D+ = 67-69
D = 64-66
D- = 60-63
F = 0-60
Class Attendance Policy
As detailed above, attending class during the scheduled meeting times earns professionalism
credit. Credit is NOT earned for arriving late, leaving early, or failing to attend class meetings. If
attending a scheduled class meeting is not possible, students are expected to promptly notify the
instructor of extenuating circumstances.
Q Drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic
reasons to six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:“Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an
institution of higher education may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six
dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of
higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
University Attendance Policy: Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD)
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations
for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for Students with
Disabilities (512-471-6259, ssd@austin.utexas.edu, http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/, or
videophone 512-471-6644). Please provide documentation of your needs during the first week of
class, if possible, so that I can make the necessary accommodations promptly.
Academic Integrity
The University's Honor Code states that “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall
abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” You are expected to
maintain absolute integrity and a high standard of individual honor in scholastic work undertaken
at the University. At a minimum, you should complete any assignments, exams, and other
scholastic endeavors with the utmost honesty, which requires you to:
    ● acknowledge the contributions of other sources to your scholastic efforts;
    ● complete your assignments independently unless expressly authorized to seek or obtain
         assistance in preparing them;


     ●   follow instructions for assignments and exams, and observe the standards of your
         academic discipline;
     ● and avoid engaging in any form of academic dishonesty on behalf of yourself or another
         student.
(adapted from ​http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php​)
Academic Dishonesty
In promoting a high standard of academic integrity, the University broadly defines academic
dishonesty as including any act designed to give an unfair or undeserved academic advantage,
such as:
     ● Cheating
     ● Plagiarism
     ● Unauthorized Collaboration / Collusion
     ● Falsifying Academic Records
     ● Misrepresenting Facts (e.g., providing false information to postpone an exam, obtain an
         extended deadline for an assignment, or even gain an unearned financial benefit)
     ● Multiple submissions (submitting essentially the same written assignment for two courses
         without authorization to do so)
     ● Any other acts (or attempted acts) that violate the basic standard of academic integrity
(adapted from http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acadint_whatis.php)
Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
(from ​http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_faculty_syllabus.php​)
Plagiarism
“Plagiarism” includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or
obtaining by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source,
including words, ideas, illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media,
and presenting that material as one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in
conjunction with a program course requirement (from Sec. 11-402,
http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-con
duct/).
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns
Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service
is provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and
Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of
Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble outside
when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the following
policies regarding evacuation: • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the
building. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered


the building. • If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of
class. • In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors. Do not
re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin
Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office.
Student Support Services
There are numerous free and/or low-cost support services available to students at UT. They
include (but are not limited to) the following:
Fine Arts Career Services​ (512-232-7333, utexas.edu/finearts/careers) provides a full range
of services and resources to support students and alumni.
The Undergraduate Writing Center
(512-471-6222, uwc.utexas.edu) helps students with every phase of writing assignments for
their courses.
The Sanger Learning Center​ (512-471-3614, utexas.edu/ugs/slc) provides study skills,
time-management, and note-taking courses.
University Health Services​ (512-471-4955, healthyhorns.utexas.edu) provides medical and health
promotion services for currently enrolled students and some non-students who are
officially enrolled in certain University programs.
The Counseling and Mental Health Center​ (512-471-3515, cmhc.utexas.edu) helps students with
their personal concerns so that they can meet the daily challenges of student life.
UT Electronic Mail Notification Policy
Electronic mail (e-mail) is a mechanism for official University and instructor communication to
students. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay
current with University- and course-related communications, recognizing that certain
communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a
minimum, twice per week.
It is the responsibility of every student to keep the University and instructor informed of changes
in his or her official e-mail address (do so at
https://utdirect.utexas.edu/utdirect/bio/address_change.WBX). Consequently, e-mail returned to
the University with "User Unknown" is not an acceptable excuse for missed communication.
Similarly, undeliverable messages returned because of a full inbox or use of a spam filter will be
considered delivered without further action required of the University or instructor.
