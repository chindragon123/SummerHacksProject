Summary
The course is designed to help students to get hands-on experience with investigating and
analyzing how people use designed objects. There is a growing body of work about usability,
but there is no substitute for asking people what they actually think, or watching what they
actually do! In this class, we will study how to do so properly.
I may change portions of this syllabus throughout the semester to adjust to student needs and
my scheduling demands.
Students will enact the following learning techniques:
                                                                                              1


INF 315C – Topics in Human Computer Interaction: User Research
We will cover three main research methods: surveying, interviewing, and observation (usability
testing). Students will read articles from industry sources. Students will also conduct sample
research projects using the methods we cover, as well as present the data they gather, both by
writing about those data and visualizing their results with charts and other techniques.

Assignments
You will need to complete assigned readings at home, work on 3 sample research projects in
two parts, respond to peers’ sample research, participate in class, and demonstrate knowledge
of the readings.
Participation and Knowledge of the readings part 1: 18 Daily Quizzes: 30%
Throughout the semester, I will administer daily quizzes (1 on every day you have readings
due). The quiz may be at the beginning, middle, or end of the class period. Each quiz will cover
that day’s readings with 2-4 questions. If you miss the time during class when the quiz occurs,
you missed it. This quiz is essentially your attendance check – are you in class and paying
attention? Then you will do well for 30% of your course grade.
Sample research projects part 1: 3x instruments of measurement 20%
You will turn in an instrument of measurement in advance of conducting each sample research
project so that you can iterate on it for your subsequent data-gathering and report. Each
should:
         •  Be submitted as one PDF document via Canvas to the appropriate assignment, on
            time, with college-level writing, and be related to a complex system.
         •  Include a citation and link to a scholarly paper from the approved list of resources
            linked in the relevant assignment on Canvas.
         •  Begin with a paragraph setting out the phenomena, interface, or problem you are
            addressing following and expanding on that prior study. Do NOT just pull your RQs,
            hypotheses, propositions, or questions out of thin air.
         •  Include the instrument itself. (for example: the questionnaire, interview questions,
            or experimental procedure.)
                                                                                                     4


INF 315C – Topics in Human Computer Interaction: User Research
Sample research projects part 2: 3x data reporting 30%
Next, you will carry out your research, with between 4 and 20 participants, depending on the
method at hand (fewer for interviews, more for surveys). You will then provide me with a
report, also in PDF format on Canvas, which includes:
        •   An introductory paragraph setting out the phenomena, interface, or problem you
            are addressing.
        •   Between 2 and 5 visualizations of your analysis, depending on the assignment (e.g.
            charts and graphs). 1-2 sentences explaining why each is important. You MAY
            describe negative results (e.g.; “I didn’t prove my hypothesis.”) In fact,
            acknowledging negative results is an important ethical consideration.
        •   A concluding paragraph suggesting what this research means for designs related to
            your topic (see: your own introduction.)
        •   An appendix with all of the data you collected.
        •   An appendix with a description of how and why you iterated on your original
            instrument.
        •   Citations to background work (e.g. the paper you cited in the first part of this
            project).
Sample research projects part 3: 3x peer responses: 20%
You will each respond to one of your peers’ reports. In your response, you should summarize
what the point of their research was, in your own words. Be sure to:
        •   Suggest 1-2 future directions for the research area.
        •   Ask the author 2-3 questions about their findings.
You will be given time IN-CLASS to complete these peer reviews. This will not require effort
outside of class time, but rather serves as an opportunity to discuss research techniques and
reflect on your learnings with your classmates.
                                                                                               5

Grading
Your assignments will be graded based on college-level writing standards including Grammar
and spelling, demonstrated clarity of thought, and structure in your writing. Your ability to
follow the instructions given and your use of resources from class (including citations). The
overall quality of your reports and responses.

A-       90 - 93.9
B+       87 - 89.9

D-       60 - 63.9 (minimum for pass/fail students to pass)
F        Below 60
Late Assignments
It is important to complete your work on time, both so you can stay on track and so you can
work with your fellow students. You will be docked 10% each day for every day late for any
assignment. Plan ahead.
                                                                                              6

Academic dishonesty
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
