  VISUAL & PERFORMING ARTS (Core Component 050)
This course may be used to fulfill the visual and performing arts component of the
university core curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by
the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking
skills, teamwork, and social responsibility.


Course Description
This course is a comprehensive study of the visual arts of Africa, in the social
and cultural contexts within which people make and use these images. Students
will explore historical, contemporary, and diasporic aspects of African art, as part
of a larger expressive complex that includes music, dance, literature, and
cinematography. The course will present the works of major artists, art groups,
ethnicities, and communities, as a lively dialog between the creative imaginations
of those who make the objects, and the philosophical responses of those to
whom the artists address the objects.
Accommodation
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information,
contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-6441 TTY.
Academic Integrity
University Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty: “Students who violate University rules
on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the
possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University,
policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information
please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs.
Religious Holy Days
It is university policy that you must notify me of a pending absence at least 14 days prior to the
date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, assignment, examination or
in-class project in order to observe, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work
within a reasonable time after the absence.
CANVAS
In this class I use CANVAS―a Web-based course management system with password-protected
access at http://canvas.utexas.edu―to distribute course materials and collaborate online. If
you require support in using CANVAS call the Information Technology Services Help Desk at
512-475-9400, Monday-Friday, 8AM-6PM, please plan accordingly.
Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence
Since email is an official method of receiving university and course communications, it is
important that your e-mail address on file with the university is kept up-to-date. I will only be
able to contact you through the address on file. You should check your e-mail regularly to stay
current. You can find instructions for updating your address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/.

        that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the building
    • If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class

miss any class. Full attendance is 20 points. For every unexcused absence from class, a student
will drop 2 points. University policy on holy days states, “A student who misses classes or other
