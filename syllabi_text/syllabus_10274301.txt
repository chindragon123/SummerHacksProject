COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
ARC 342R.2/388R.2 surveys architecture in the United States from Pre-Columbian times to the present.
It is arranged chronologically and thematically to consider topics such as Native American architecture,
national and regional identity, and responses to rapid economic and social change. In addition to
examples by celebrated architects such as Thomas Jefferson, H. H. Richardson, Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis
Kahn, and Charles Moore, the course examines aspects of vernacular building and regional building.
Architecture in the American South and Southwest, including Texas is considered within these broader
contexts.
The course meets twice a week for one-and-a-half hours. Students are expected to read a wide array of
primary and background texts and participate in writing assignments. This is an intermediate-level,
lecture/discussion course building on the foundation of the world architecture survey sequence. It offers
frameworks for interpreting the history of architecture in the United States and opportunities for
developing research and writing skills.
PREREQUISITES

The distribution of percent and corresponding grades is given below (plus and minus will be given):
              A (94-100%)       A- (93-90%)      B+ (89-86%)       B (85-83%)         B- (82-80%)
                                C+ (79-76%)       C (75-73%)       C- (72-70%)

“A” represents exemplary work in which the student has successfully realized his or her stated
objectives in terms of content and style; “B” has broader compass in which the intentions of the
assignment are met adequately but with some weakness of content or style or reticence in approach;
“C” acknowledges effort but reflects serious problems in content or style; “D” and “F” reflect a
fundamental lack of effort. I use plus and minus grades for both graduate students and undergraduates.
WORKLOAD GUIDELINES
Students are expected to spend time on outside preparation for every class. If writing assignments are
due, students should expect to spend more time to complete their work. Required readings are outside
preparation for this course and should be completed before class for the day they are assigned.
Students are responsible for all the material in the required readings, whether or not the material has
been discussed in class.
ATTENDANCE POLICY
Class attendance is required. Students are also required to attend all discussion sessions. Your success
in this class will depend, to a large degree, upon your attendance and active engagement. In-class
material will be reinforced in the required and recommended readings, and some in-class material may
not be covered in the readings. Students are responsible for all lecture material whether or not it is
included in the assigned readings. Class attendance is required and will be monitored. Sometimes an
illness, emergency, or other circumstances may cause you to miss class. Missing extensive days results in
a significant impact on your work, and to your participation in the class. If you miss class, try to borrow a
classmate's notes. The instructor will not assume responsibility for providing class notes to you. All
exams must be taken on the dates scheduled. Students will only be permitted to take make-up exams in
the case of medical or family emergencies, or if they are away on official university business. Late
assignments will not be accepted. Please take advantage of my office hours to discuss the course or just
to talk. If you cannot make my regular office hours, I am willing to meet you by appointment.
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS
The University respects religious holidays. Students are excused from attending classes or other
required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holiday, including travel for
that purpose. If you will miss class (including exams) to celebrate a religious holiday, UT Austin policy
requires that you must notify me of your pending absence AT LEAST 14 days prior to the date of the
observance of a religious holy day (and your absence). You will be given an opportunity to complete the
missed work, including examinations, within a reasonable time (generally one week) after the absence.


ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for
qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities

UT HONOR CODE AND ACADEMIC DISHONESTY
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership,
individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the University is expected to uphold these
values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community. Cheating
and plagiarism (using another person's words or ideas without proper attribution) are serious
academic offenses and may result in a failing grade or expulsion from the university! If you are unsure
about what constitutes plagiarism or have questions about how to employ source material in your
assignments, please consult with me. You are encouraged to discuss your assignments with your peers
but the work you submit must be your own.
Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the most common form of academic dishonesty. Plagiarism can be a difficult concept to
define; however, simply put, plagiarism is using other people’s ideas and words without clearly
acknowledging the source of that information. It is important to note that at the university we are
continually exposed to other’s ideas. We read ideas and words in textbooks, hear them in lectures,
discuss them in class, and incorporate them into our own writing. One must always keep in mind that
you must give credit when credit is due.
Plagiarism can occur in a myriad of forms and media. Although most commonly associated with writing,
all types of scholarly work, including architectural and interior design projects, music, scientific data and
analysis, and electronic publications. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, the appropriation, buying,
receiving as a gift, or obtaining by any other means another's work and the submission of it as one's own
academic work offered for credit. University policy pertaining to scholastic dishonesty applies to in-class
assignments, projects, examinations, research reports, papers, and assignments required for the course.
Additional information on the definition of academic dishonesty including plagiarism can be found at
http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi09-10/app/gi09.appc03.html. In order to avoid plagiarism, you
must give credit whenever you use:
     • Another person’s idea, opinion, or theory;
     • Any facts, statistics, graphics, visual images (i.e.: drawings, videos, etc.) that are not common
         knowledge;
     • Quotations of another person’s spoken or written words; or
     • Paraphrase of another person’s spoken or written words.
Students who are in violation of the university’s plagiarism policy may be subject to the following:
     • Disciplinary probation
     • Receive a failing grade for a test, assignment, or the course
     • Creation of a disciplinary record which may impact their future
     • Suspension or expulsion from The University of Texas at Austin
     • Denial of degree
If you are unsure about what constitutes plagiarism and academic dishonesty, or have difficulty
addressing source material in your assignments, please consult with the instructor.
