Course Description:
This course introduces students to the design and analysis of structures through graphical and
analytical methods as well as through physical models. The structural behavior of columns and
beams as well as the design of various structural components and connections will be covered.
The importance of material choice and structural efficiency in design will be a common theme
throughout the course. Graphic statics will provide a basis for visualizing how external forces,
form and internal forces in elements are related.
A creative approach to architectural design with structural knowledge is encouraged. Knowledge
obtained in this course will include preliminary sizing and analysis methods as well as
geometrical form finding techniques.
Course Format:
The course is composed of lectures presenting material to be used in the design exercises as
well as the lab exercises. The exam will be based on material covered in the lectures. Lab
exercise tasks will be presented to the students at the end of the lecture and are to be
completed in groups during the lab sessions. Completed work is to be handed in at the end
each lab session. The lab sessions will also provide students the opportunity to ask for feedback
on their projects. One structural design project will be given during this course. Details of the
assignments will be handed out during the semester.

UT Statements:
Attendance Policy
Attendance is mandatory in all lectures and labs. At the instructor's discretion, any student with
more than 2 unexcused absences may be dropped from the class or the student's final grade
may be lowered by one letter grade for each additional absence. Absences are excused only for
medical conditions and personal or family emergencies. Written documentation will be required
for any excused absence. A student who misses classes or other required activities for the
observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence
as possible, so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable
time after the absence. A student who fails to complete missed work within the time allowed will
be subject to the normal academic penalties.
For Undergraduate Students: Quantitative Reasoning Flag
This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are
designed to equip you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative
arguments you will regularly encounter in your professional life. You should therefore expect a
substantial portion of your grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-
world problems.
Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities who require special accommodations need to get a letter that
documents the disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of the
Dean of Students (471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing).


This letter should be presented to the instructor in each course at the beginning of the semester
and accommodations needed should be discussed at that time. Five business days before an
exam the student should remind the instructor of any testing accommodations that will be
needed.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns
Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about another individualâ€™s behavior. This service
is provided through a partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and
Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of
Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232- 5050 or visit http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.
Policy on Academic Integrity
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University,
policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For further information, visit the SJS
website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs or call 471-2841.
