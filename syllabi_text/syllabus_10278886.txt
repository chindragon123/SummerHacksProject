I.       Rationale
Students will acquire procedural audio skills using SuperCollider as a tool for real-time, generative audio
production. Additionally, students will learn how to integrate such generative processes with other media
(live digital visualization, etc.) and will explore methods of textural generation and sound design using
SuperCollider.
Course Prerequisite(s): AET 320D Musical Acoustics
II.      Course Aims and Objectives
By the end of this course, students will:
•    Learn proper coding practices using SuperCollider, a powerful, flexible, open-source, cross-platform
     audio programming language
•    Employ controllers to communicate sensor data to software
•    Create logic systems to transmit audio and music data using MIDI and OSC
•    Generate reactive and adaptive audio responses to external stimuli
•    Create complex musical textures and soundscapes using SuperCollider

IV.    Course Requirements
       Class attendance and participation policy:
       Regular and punctual attendance at all classes is required. Attendance is taken at the beginning of
       every class. Absences of each student are recorded without exception from the official date of her/his
       enrollment. Both tardiness and early departure from class are forms of absenteeism. 15 minutes late
       to the start of class will constitute a tardy. At the end of each class, tardy students must make the
       instructor aware of their attendance or they will be marked as absent. Leaving class before being
       dismissed by your professor will constitute an early departure. Two instances of tardiness or early
       departure equal one absence. A class in which a student is tardy and departs early on the same day is
       considered an absence. If a serious medical or personal situation occurs affecting attendance, please
       discuss it with your professor. More than three unexcused absences will cause your final grade to
       automatically drop one letter.
       Course Materials/Readings/Tutorials:
       Students in Generative Audio Programming are required to download SuperCollider on their laptops
       for this course. It is open source and cross platform. I will post readings and tutorials as necessary to
       supplement learning.
       Optional Textbook:
       Wilson, Scott, Cottle, David, & Collins, Nick, (2011) The SuperCollider Book, MIT Press
       Supplies needed:
       Over-the-ear headphones and external hard drive REQUIRED for every class meeting!
       Use of Canvas in class:
       In this class I use Canvas—a Web-based course management system with password-protected access
       at http://courses.utexas.edu —to distribute course materials, to communicate and collaborate
       online, to post grades, to submit assignments.

V.       Grading Procedures
         Grades will be based on:
         1. Weekly Assignments                                         40%
         2. Midterm Project                                            20%
         3. Final Project                                              30%
         4. Class Participation /Attendance                            10%
         Late/Missed Assignments:
         If you miss an assignment deadline due to a serious, documented medical or personal situation, I will
         give you an opportunity to complete the work within a reasonable time. Otherwise, late assignments
         will receive a maximum grade value of 50%. May 7th is the last call for any late assignments from the
         semester (graded at 50% maximum value).
         Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric. Please note: to ensure
         fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will be
         inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not recognize the grade of A+.
         A = 94-100
         A- = 90-93
         B+ = 87-89
         B = 84-86
         B- = 80-83
         C+ = 77-79
         C = 74-76
         C- = 70-73
         D+ = 67-69
         D = 64-66
         D- = 60-63
         F = 0-60
         This course will not have a final exam.
VI.      Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The
University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic
integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your
own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of
plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for
understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code, which can be found at the
following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
VII.     Other University Notices and Policies
 Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence to Students
All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student notification policy. It is the
student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or her e-mail address. Students
are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related
communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-
mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this policy and instructions for
updating your e-mail address are available at http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564.

Q drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six
Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution.
For more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn
differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me
know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of
the course. There are also a range of resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information
that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be
evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment for all
students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain
the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact:
Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone).
http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope
with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking
for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support.

Religious Holidays
Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code states that a student shall be excused from attending classes or
other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including travel
for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized for that
absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the student is
excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy requires students to notify each of their
instructors at least fourteen days prior to the date they will be absent from scheduled classes to observe a
religious holy day.
(from http://www.utexas.edu/provost/policies/religious_holidays/1555_001.pdf)
Emergency Evacuation Policy
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and
Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling
outside.
 • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember
      that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
 • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week
      of class.
 • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a
      building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas
