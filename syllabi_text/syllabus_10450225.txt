 OVERVIEW:           This is a hybrid (synchronous and asynchronous), discussion-based
                     course with deadlines. We will meet live at our class time on Tuesdays
                     and Thursdays for discussion and lecture.
Overview
What is this class about?
This course is an invitation into the field of Women’s and Gender Studies and a survey of
key concepts of particular interest to feminists in and out of the academy. We build on
feminist traditions of questioning social inequality across scales, from individual bodies to
global phenomenon; valuing diversity in ways of thinking, creating and living; and
envisioning justice through personal and collective action. This course is interdisciplinary –
introducing feminist interventions in a broad range of fields – and intersectional –
examining how gender and sexuality intersect with social hierarchies, especially focusing
on race and ethnicity.
What will you take away from this class?
 An introduction to gender and sexuality through key texts
 An appreciation for the contributions of Women’s and Gender Studies
 Experience applying feminist analysis in addressing sociopolitical issues and enacting
    social change
 Invaluable critical thinking, reading and writing skills, as well as independent research
    and project management practice
                                                                                                   1


What skills will you build in an online course that you might not in a physical class?
 Motivation, independence, and community-building – without in-person classes to
    provide daily accountability, you will need to take ownership of your learning by
    relying on internal motivations and building connections with your colleagues.
 Effective time-management skills – I suggest you set up a daily work routine in which
    you dedicate at least 2 hours a day to classwork. You may make a daily “to-do” list to
    check off tasks and develop a long term plan for completing larger assignments.
 Persistence when faced with challenges in your learning environment (ex. technical
    problems, distractions at home) and Initiative to seek help when needed.
How will you learn?
This is on online course structured as weekly units and organized around key concepts.
Each week, we will closely read foundational scholarly texts, and apply these insights to
case studies to explore their relevance in the real world. Case studies include discussion of
contemporary sociopolitical problems as well as creative productions that intervene in
popular debate. Reflecting feminist commitments to diverse knowledges, the class will
incorporate work by a range of thinkers, activists, and artists, and encourage students to
consider themselves as knowledge producers based on their unique skills and interests.
About Me
Dr. Sarah Nicholus
I am an interdisciplinary media and cultural studies scholar working in gender and
sexuality studies in Brazil and the Americas. I use cultural methodologies, including
performance and visual methods, to better understand queerness and LGBT+ sexuality in
rural and socially conservative spaces. I speak Spanish and Portuguese and am interested
in transnational feminist coalitions across linguistic and cultural difference. Teaching is an
integral part of my scholarship and activism, and I am interested in how we can create a
more just university.

Course grading
Your course grade includes 3 components: Participation and Attendance (30%), Discussion
Forum (35%), and an Intervention (35%). I describe each component below. More detailed
instructions and grading rubrics will be provided on Canvas.
     ● Participation and Attendance (30%)
            ○ Includes check-ins, course and self-evaluations, events, sharing of resources,
               reflections, thoughts, questions, and ideas shared.
     ● Discussion Forum (35%)
            ○ Post in Discussion Forum
            ○ Read the posts and create 2-3 Questions to pose to the class
            ○ Answer the questions posed
            ○ Respond to the answers
     ● Intervention (35%)
            ○ Topic, Preparation, Process, Presentation, Product
Grades will reflect the following scale:
      A = 94-100                    A = 94-100                     A = 94-100
      A- = 90-93                    A- = 90-93                     A- = 90-93
                                                                                              3


      B+ = 87-89                      B+ = 87-89                     B+ = 87-89
      B = 84-86                       B = 84-86                      B = 84-86
Attendance
Attendance will be taken every live class. Absences will only be excused in case of a
medical, family or personal emergencies. In these situations, please email me as soon as
possible with relevant documentation. You are responsible for any class content missed.
Since this is a discussion-based course, not being present in class will adversely impact
your understanding of course material. Please check in with other students to cover
material you miss; I will not go over class content with you individually. I will make
recordings of the live sessions available for up to a week after the session.
Discussion forum
The Discussion Forum offers you an opportunity to reflect on the readings in response to a
prompt. Close and consistent engagement with the assigned readings is crucial to your
success in this class. This is a collaborative assignment, so please be considerate of your
colleagues and communicate, if needed. You are required to do 4 engagements in the
Discussion Forum: An original post (based on a prompt), reading original posts and
crafting 2-3 substantial questions for your peers to answer, answering the questions
posed, and a response by the original poster to the answers. You will not be penalized if
you cannot do your part because the person before you does not submit by the deadline. In
that case, you can choose another post to engage. Your entire group’s forum thread must be
posted by 11:30am on Mondays. All forum engagements should show that you have read
the material, demonstrate your understanding, and point to further questions. You will
have to work with your peers and manage your time in order to submit all the posts by the
deadline each week.
Intervention
What tools does feminism offer to envision and enact social change? For this independent
project, you will choose a sociopolitical topic of interest to you, apply critical analysis skills,
and produce creative material that attempts to intervene in how that problem is discussed,
understood and approached.
The project is scaffolded, involving five phases:
    •   Topic (memo identifying a topic of interest);
    •   Preparation (memo outlining project goals);
    •   Process (annotated bibliography involving course materials and background
        research);
    •   Presentation (concise sharing of knowledge with class, approx. 5min);
    •   And Product (creative project suitable to the topic and audience).
                                                                                                    4


For this project, you will not be engaging with outside audiences. Rather, the class will
serve as a practice space to experiment and receive feedback. Training in research and
presentation skills will be provided. Additional information will be shared on Canvas.
Communication
Communication is especially important in an online class! If you have any problems
concerning the course, if there are particular topics you are excited by and want to talk
more about, if you want to better prepare for assignments, or for any other issues related
to this class, please don’t hesitate to come to office hours or reach out to me to set up a
meeting. Also, if you decide to drop this course at any point please have a conversation with
me before you do so, or at least notify me when you do.
Classroom Environment
The classroom is a place for dialogue across intellectual and identitarian difference; I am
committed to making sure that all students can pursue their interests and engage with
materials in an environment that is supportive and healthy. I can’t guarantee you a “safe
space” as I do not know all of the complexities that each of you brings to the class, but I do
hope you will see the classroom as a place to ask new questions, learn through discomfort,
and hone your critical thinking skills. I ask us to respect each other’s identities and also
grant each other grace to make mistakes. We must own and acknowledge our privileges,
and be humble enough to apologize when our language offends. I also ask us to be aware of
how we take up space and time in the class; be sure to share airtime and to direct your
comments and questions to your peers and not just to me.
Cultural Diversity in the U.S. Flag
This course carries a Cultural Diversity flag which means you will have the to explore in
depth the shared practices and beliefs of one or more underrepresented cultural groups
subject to persistent marginalization. In addition to learning about these diverse groups in
relation to their specific contexts, you’ll also reflect on your own cultural experiences.
Schedule
We will meet synchronously on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Please plan accordingly.
** Schedule and readings may change. Please check website for updated syllabus. **
Note: Readings and materials for each day are listed under “Prepare for Class” and should
be read/viewed prior to our class time if we are meeting. If we are not meeting, it’s a good
idea to do the reading that day in order to best manage workload. Assignments should be
submitted before our class start time (i.e. 11:30am) on the day they are due.
For the Discussion Forum, original posts should be posted on Wednesday.
The questions should be posted on Thursday. The answers should be posted on Friday. The
original poster then has the weekend to respond to the questions and answers. The whole
thread should be done by 11:30am on Monday.
                                                                                               5

   University Policies
   Academic Integrity
         I anticipate and encourage you to work collaboratively. All knowledge we produce builds on and is in
         conversation with others. However, passing off ideas as your own without reference is, simply put,
         plagiarism.
         ** Please take care when reading, writing or doing research! **
         • Do not cut and paste from other sources, even when taking notes
         • Be sure to quote and cite any words, images or material that are not your own
         • You must cite sources even when you paraphrase
   NOTE: Please follow MLA rules for all citations. Learn more: http://guides.lib.utexas.edu/citesources
         You are expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The University of
         Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.”
         When you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous classes), you
         must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary
         action, including failure of the course. Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Learn more about
         Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web
         address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
     Q Drop Policy
         To drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the deadline, which
         typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Texas law only permits six Q drops while you are in
         college at any public Texas institution. Learn more:

   Counseling and Mental Health Center
         If you are struggling with personal circumstances, including anxiety, depression, stress, difficult life
         events or concerns about your lifestyle, these can affect your ability to learn. Mental health
         professionals on campus are available to support you:
                                                                                                          9

Sexual Assault Support and Title IX Reporting
     The university offers resources for victims of sexual assault. Learn about your options:
     https://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/vav/vav_sexualviolence.html
     Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment,
     sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded
     educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free
     from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university
     can:
             1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
             2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or
                  have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
             3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
     Faculty and staff are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters,” which means
     that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. I am a Responsible
     Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-
     on-one. Before speaking with me or any faculty or staff member, consider whether you want the
     incident reported. https://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/vav/vav_reportingoptions.html#A
     To speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official report, email
     advocate@austin.utexas.edu. You may also speak confidentially with licensed staff at the UT
     Counseling and Mental Health Center and University Health Services.
     For more information about reporting options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the
     Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
