This course focuses on the artistic, cultural, and urbanistic
practices of modernism as it emerged south of the Rio Grande.
Starting   from   Garcia   Canclini’s  provocative    definition   of
modernism before modernization, the course uses modern
architecture as a departure point for investigating the political,
social and economic factors as well as the artistic expression of
what has been called "peripheral modernization" in the twentieth
century. The course included most Latin American countries:
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and
Venezuela. Organized mostly around discussions and student
presentations, the course requires students to analyze artistic and
cultural manifestations of a variety of modernist manifestations.
The first half of the course is devoted to the ideas behind the
concepts of modernity, modernization and modernism, paying
special attention to the ways ideas and periodization vary in
different national contexts. The second half of the course uses
Latin American Modern Architecture as a case study for exploring
how these concepts were expressed through specific artistic and
urbanist form. Students will then produce an original final paper
on a case study of their choice and a podcast based on our class
discussions.

In this course e-mail will be used as a means of communication with students. You will be
responsible for checking your e-mail regularly for class work and announcements.
All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student notification policy.
It is the student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or her e-mail
address. Students are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay
current with University-related communications, recognizing that certain communications may be
time-critical. It is recommended that e-mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week.
The complete text of this policy and instructions for updating your e-mail address are available at
http://www.utexas.edu/its/policies/emailnotify.html.
Students with disabilities who require special accommodations need to get a letter that documents
the disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the Office of the Dean of
Students (471-6259 voice or 471-4641 TTY for users who are deaf or hard of hearing). This letter
should be presented to the instructor in each course at the beginning of the semester and
accommodations needed should be discussed at that time. Five business days before an exam the
student should remind the instructor of any testing accommodations that will be needed.
This course uses Canvas, a Web-based course management system in which a password-protected
site is created for each course. Student enrollments in each course are updated each evening.
Blackboard can be used to distribute course materials, to communicate and collaborate online, to
post grades, to submit assignments, and to take online quizzes and surveys.
You will be responsible for checking the Canvas course site regularly for class work and
announcements. As with all computer systems, there are occasional scheduled downtimes as well


as unanticipated disruptions. Notification of these disruptions will be posted on the Canvas login
page. Scheduled downtimes are not an excuse for late work. However, if there is an unscheduled
downtime for a significant period of time, I will make an adjustment if it occurs close to the due
date.
Academic Integrity: According to the General Information catalog, “the value of a university degree
depends on the absolute integrity of the work done by each student for that degree, a student
should maintain a high standard of individual honor in his or her scholastic work” (page98).
Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University. Since such
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
