                                     Course Description
This course is designed for intermediate and experienced communications, PR, and advertising stu-
dents who are seeking a greater understanding of social enterprises and how to effectively brand those
social enterprises. This course will focus specifically on the for-profit sector of social enterprises seek-
ing to balance purpose and profit. The balance of those foundational elements is delicate and critical.
Learning how to effectively communicate them reinforces the trust and ultimate success of a brand.
A growing number of consumers want to incorporate some aspect of, “giving back” through their every
purchase. Companies want to meet that demand and are looking for the skilled individuals to communi-
cate those cause-based impacts. In-class instruction, industry leader guest interviews, and a semester
project will serve to provide an overview of social entrepreneurship, industry trends, and best practices
in branding related to cause marketing and corporate social responsibility.
    “Humanity’s greatest advances are not in its discoveries but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity.”
