                       COURSE DESCRIPTION & OBJECTIVES
Despite the overwhelming research on human trafficking in Asia, Europe and the
Americas, relatively very scanty information is known about the global pandemic in
Africa. For instance, major parts of West Africa economies are largely dependent on
the exploitation of natural economic resources like agriculture and mining. The region
has the fastest growing population rates with disproportionate social amenities,
inadequate physical infrastructures, uncontrolled urbanization, high incidence of
unemployment, poverty, pervading insecurities and weak social institutions with wide
inequities in distribution of wealth amidst very conspicuous gender inequality. All
these factors have contributed to making human trafficking for the purpose of sexual
exploitation a viable option for both the traffickers and the trafficked. The
ethnographic study of human trafficking is imperative to capturing the complex dynamics
associated with sex trafficking as such analyses go beyond the individuals and assess the
context; political economy, social cultural environment and the legal/ regulatory
frameworks in the region, Nigeria in West Africa, a significant source, transit point, and
destination for sex-trafficking. Hence, historical processes, social institutions within
pervasive patriarchal structures in which this phenomenon of human trafficking is
implicated will be examined, engaging ethnographic lens. This course will introduce
students to the challenges of human trafficking and other endemic forms of exploitation,
highlighting critical factors associated with its prevalence. The attendant consequences of
human trafficking on selected social structures in the region will be explored.

Note: The grades are weighted. Grading will be based on 100 total percentage points
divided accordingly.
Overall semester averages will earn the following letter grades:
93-100: A     90-92: A-
87-89: B+     83-86: B      80-82: B-
77-79: C+     73-76: C      70-72: C-
67-69: D+     63-66: D      60-62: D-      0-59: F
Evaluation and Points: (No extra credit will be awarded, and the course is not
graded on curve) The weight is distributed to ensure success for all students, balancing
the various needs to participate, interact, engage, think critically, and write well. Not all
students seek an A or B grade, but those who do should expect to do the maximum
required. Always read before the class so that you can understand the lectures and ask
questions.

Class rules:
     1)   All assignments must be submitted on due dates. At least, 2 points per day are
          deducted thereafter.
     2)   Except on medical ground or permission from the Dean’s office, there is no make-
          up examination.
     3)   There is no option for additional credit.
     4)   Failure to read the books or journals, which will be detected in projects and
          examinations, will be treated as lack of preparation.
     5)   Attendance is necessary to make sense of the lectures. It is expected that lectures
          and class discussions will be reflected in all projects. The Instructor will not use
          office hours to repeat class lectures but to clarify points.
Attendance policy:
The class attendance will be counted from the 23rd of January 2020. It will be counted
based on the total of 27 remaining classes. So, for each absence, students will lose
approximately 0.37 points from the final grade. Absences will be excused if a student
provides documentation of emergency health situation, death in family, job interviews,
etc. However, without documentation no excuses will be granted.
Periodic class quiz:
The periodic class quiz is designed to enhance students’ familiarity with the continent of
Africa as it relates to the incidence of human trafficking. Additional instructions to take
the test will be given during class.
Film Writing Assignments
   A list of several documentary films will be provided for a good understanding of the
social context in which human trafficking occurs in West Africa will be shared.
Students will be duly informed about the film. Students are to select three, write a 3-5
pages in response to the information provided in the film, summing up key points,
providing any critique, and incorporating/relating it to other information learned in the
class. You are to submit the assignment promptly when it is due.
Assignments:
Critical questions arising from assigned texts will be raised. Sometimes written
responses to these questions will be requested (especially those that are particularly
                                                 4        
  


related to your exams, i.e., for exam prep). Other times, questions will be used solely
as a guide for class discussion. You are expected to participate in the class discussion
and must be prepared for each class by completing your reading assignments. The
instructor will determine those written assignment that will be turned in.
Presentation:
A group presentation will be given to each group based on the specific objective of
the course. The idea is to stimulate teamwork and develop problem solving strategies
through brain storming sessions and enhance presentation skills of students. More
information will be provided as soon as the course commences.
Final Examination:
The examination consists of two essay questions. Students are expected to answer both
questions, writing at least three pages on each. Essay questions will be drawn from a pool
of questions submitted through Canvas. The exams require that you integrate materials
from textbooks, lecture notes, and films.

Documented Disability Statement: The University of Texas at Austin provides upon
request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For
more information, contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or
232-2937 (video phone).
Trigger Warnings: Sensitive Content: This is a course on human trafficking and its
gendered dimensions in Africa, so the content and discussion will necessarily engage
with sensitive material in each class session, all the readings, and in the assignments.
Those topics may include the following: violence, kidnapping and abduction, sexual
assault, abuse, ethnic discrimination, religious discrimination, and sexism. Some of the
materials are emotionally and intellectually challenging to engage with. Since I am not a
mental health professional I do not understand all possible conditions that could be
triggered, so if I need to be aware of any personal circumstances, please stop by and let
me know or provide an SSD accommodations letter and I will be happy to adjust as
possible. To the full extent possible, I will provide alternative readings, assignments, or
discussion opportunities to adequately accommodate. More generally, I will do my best
to make space for thoughtful, respectful, and meaningful discussion of difficult content
each class session, while balancing the weightiness of the topics, including when possible
advance notice of material that is more sensitive than usual for a course on human
trafficking. Students with concerns related to these topics may wish and are encouraged
to consult the UT Counseling and Mental Health Center: https://cmhc.utexas.edu, or
another organization that provides suitable support. (Some of this material adapted
from https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/inclusive- teaching/).
Religious Holy Days: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence
at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must
miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a
religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a
reasonable time after the absence.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): If you are worried about someone who is
acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone
your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a
partnership among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health
Center (CMHC), the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas
Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit:

Use of E-Mail for Official Correspondence to Students: E-mail is recognized as an
official mode of university correspondence; therefore, you are responsible for reading
your e-mail for university and course-related information and announcements. You are
responsible to keep the university informed about changes to your e-mail address. You
should check your e-mail regularly and frequently—I recommend daily, but at minimum
twice a week—to stay current with university-related communications, some of which
may be time-critical. You can find UT Austin’s policies and instructions for updating
your e-mail address at http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564
Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble
outside when a fire alarm is activated, or an announcement is made. Please be aware of
the following policies regarding evacuation: Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of
the classroom and the building. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one
you used when you entered the building.
If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of class.
In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors. Do not
re-enter a building unless the Austin Fire Department, the UT Austin Police Department,
or the Fire Prevention Services office gives you instructions.
Q Drop Policy: Texas law limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six.
Senate Bill 1231 says: “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of
higher education may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six
dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has dropped at another
institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more
than that number.
