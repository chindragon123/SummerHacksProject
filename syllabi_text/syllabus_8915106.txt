American prose fiction and Persian lyric poetry are two of the most vital literary traditions in world
literature. This course deals with one prominent figure in each, the American fiction writer Zora Neale
Hurston (1891-1960) and the Iranian lyric poet Forugh Farrokhzād (1934-1967).
     A three-fold rationale accounts for the comparative pairing of these two writers in this course. First,
both have special and similar relationships to the literary traditions in which they wrote because of their
gender and because of Farrokhzād's lack of participation in Muslim culture, on the one hand, and
Hurston's African ancestry, on the other. Second, Farrokhzād and Hurston exhibit similar subject matter
interests and points of view, presumably in part because of their modernist perspectives and similar
removes from mainstream cultural and social power bases. Third, they use prose fiction and lyric poetry,
respectively, as vehicles for self-revelation and self-realization. Such self-revelation has particular
significance both because of its cultural unexpectedness from “minority” writers in their respective
traditions and because of mixed consequent mainstream reaction to it.
     The core course activities are close readings and group discussion of the chief writings of Hurston
and Farrokhzād in the contexts, respectively, of the crafts of prose fiction and lyric verse, the practice of
autobiography, American culture, Iranian culture, and women’s participation in American and Persian/
Iranian literatures. Students leave the course well acquainted with the lives and works of two prominent
writers and with literary modernism and are better prepared thereafter to read and analyze works of
prose fiction and lyric verse in vacuo and in their cultural contexts.
     The required course texts are: (1) Joanna Russ’s How to Suppress Women’s Writing (1983); (2) Zora
Neale Hurston’s Jonah’s Gourd Vine (1934), (3) Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937) and the feature
film of the same name (2005), (4) Dust Tracks on a Road (1942), and (5) Seraph on the Suwanee (1948);
(6) Michael Hillmann, A Lonely Woman: Forugh Farrokhzād and Her Poetry (1987, available in the
course Dropbox folder; (7) A Voice and Sounds That Remain: Forty Poems by Forugh Farrokhzād in
English Translation (2018, in the course Dropbox folder); and (8) “Self-Revelation in Women’s Writing:
A Course Packet” (in the course Dropbox folder) containing chronologies, biographical sketches, a
handful of critical essays, Hurston’s short story called “Drenched in Light” (1924), and the course
bibliography.
     Course grades are based on: (1) class participation, e.g., discussion of assigned readings [20% of the
course grade]; (2) two oral presentations: a report on an assigned primary course (i.e., a poem or a short
story or a discrete part of a novel), and a report on an assigned secondary source (i.e., a biographical or
literary critical study) [15% of the course grade each]; (3) a review test on the third to the last day of the
course [25% of the course grade]; and (4) a term paper [25% of the course grade] on a subject chosen in
discussion with the instructor. The course has no final examination. The grading scale is: A (93–100), A-
(90–92), B+ (87–89), B (83–86), B- (80–82), C+ (77–79), C (73–76), C- (70–72), D+ (67–69), D
(63-66), D- (60–62), and F (0-59).
