                                  The Black Middle Class
Course Description
This semester we will embark on an interdisciplinary exploration of the African
American middle class in the US from early 20th century to the present, with a
particular emphasis on post-Civil Rights era developments. We will use literature, film,
history, theatre, cultural studies, music, television, and sociology to examine how the
black middle class has been imagined, defined and represented. By examining the
debates within and about the black middle class, we will complicate constructions of
race and class in America. The course is particularly interested in investigating the
following: the concept of racial uplift; the construction of the “race man” and “race
woman;” the idea of class privilege for a racially marginalized group; conflicts between
the black middle class and the working class; the role of the black middle class in
policing black sexuality; expressions of middle class rage; the rise of the black nerd (or
blerd); assertions of racial authenticity; the new black aesthetic; the politics of
affirmative action and the price of integration.

Course Requirements
Attendance & Participation
Students are expected to complete all reading before class and participate fully in
discussions and activities (presentations, quizzes, in-class writing and group projects).
Remember to bring texts to class because we will be reading excerpts and doing close
readings of passages. Please be advised that prompt and regular attendance is expected.
Missing two classes and/or excessive tardiness will result in your grade being lowered.
Quizzes
There will be five multiple-choice quizzes that cover the major themes, concepts,
characters, authors and theories discussed in the course. The quizzes will not only test
whether you are completing the assigned reading, but also assess your comprehension
of the lecture and class discussions. You must complete the quiz before class on the date
that it is listed. It will cover the assigned material prior to and on that day.
Essay
You will write a 6-8 page critical essay that compares the rendering of the black middle
class in two texts chosen from two different sections of the course. I encourage you to
consult with me at any stage in your writing process. Make sure you argue a strong
thesis and carefully proofread your papers for clarity and grammatical errors. I expect
your essays to adhere to either the MLA Style Manual or the Chicago Manual of Style
for formatting and documentation. All work must be typed in a 12-point academic font
(Times, Palatino, Times New Roman), and doubled-spaced with one-inch margins.
Submit essays by the deadline as no late work will be accepted. Please note: no
incompletes or extensions will be granted without my prior written permission.
Group Research Project: Essay & Presentation
Each group will conduct research and write a paper on a topic (chosen in consultation
with me) that explores an aspect of the black middle class not covered in class.
Suggested topics, as well as additional guidelines for the research project, proposal,
essay and presentation, will be posted on Canvas and discussed in class. Each group
must submit 7-10 page critical essay including proper citations and a properly formatted
works cited page. Groups will also deliver a brief (5-10 minute) presentation based on
their research project and essay. Students are strongly encouraged to use their creativity
to present their findings. I encourage you to create a video, short skit, website,
Wikipedia Page, Tumbler, Instagram, PowerPoint or another presentation tool to share
your subject. The point of this exercise is to learn about and then teach your classmates
about an aspect of the black middle class NOT explored thoroughly in class. Use this as
an opportunity to refine your oral presentation skills. Focus on working collaboratively,
writing clearly, and presenting in ways that showcase your creativity, and expertise.
