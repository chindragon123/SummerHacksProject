                                         Course Description
Autism is a disorder that is present very early in development. It is characterized by
difficulties in social interaction, the ability to communicate ideas and feelings to others, and
the establishment of relationships with other people. Many of these children also display
severe challenging behaviors such as self-injury and aggression. These difficulties vary in
severity across individuals and within the individual over time. This course provides the
student with an overview and review of the current issues and recent advances regarding
assessment and education of these children.
                                          Course Objectives
Upon the completion of this course, you should be able to:
     • Name two defining characteristics of autism spectrum disorders
     • Describe how the characteristics of ASD may affect an individual’s functioning
     • Describe at least two educational programs used to teach individuals with ASD
     • List two strategies used to improve communication and language
     • List two strategies used to improve social skills
     • List two strategies used to decrease challenging behaviors
     • Describe one controversial treatment used with individuals with ASD
     • Describe how ethnic and familial cultures may impact assessment, education and/or

This book is available in full text on the UT Libraries website. You can use the above link to
take you to the ebook version online. You are also welcome to purchase this book if you’d
like to keep it for your own professional library in the future.


The weekly readings are outlined in the Modules on Canvas organized by week and topic.
Links to most of the files are available on Canvas. The readings were meant to be read in the
order presented in the curriculum. As this is a summer course, we have less time to delve
into our readings in depth, so I also listed “Optional Readings” for each class day if you are
interested in reading further into any topics.
Course Website—Canvas
This course will utilize Canvas. You will be responsible for checking the Canvas course site
regularly for class work and announcements. As with all computer systems, there are
occasional scheduled downtimes as well as unanticipated disruptions. Notification of these
disruptions will be posted on the Canvas login page. Scheduled downtimes are not an
excuse for late work. However, if there is an unscheduled downtime for a significant period
of time, we will make an adjustment if it occurs close to the due date of an assignment.
Canvas is available at https://canvas.instructure.com/login. Support is provided by the ITS
Help Desk at 512-475-9400 or you can submit a help request here:
http://www.utexas.edu/its/helpdesk. Office hours are posted here as well, so plan
accordingly.
Class attendance and participation:
        Attendance at class is mandatory. If you wish to be absent for the observance of a
religious holy day then please give notification to me at least fourteen days prior to your
absence or please inform me the first class day for religious holy days that fall within the
first two weeks of the semester.
Participation expectations:
        This class is very much what you make of it. Many of you may have a fair amount of
experience working with individuals with autism. Although I will lecture, I also expect that
you will bring forth your own stories of challenges and achievements. It is an opportunity or
forum for you to share your knowledge with your fellow colleagues.
        In addition to learning the content of the readings I want you to be able to critically
evaluate the material in terms of your own personal experiences. Some of you will have
more experience, some will have positive experiences, some will have negative experiences
etc. I want you to be able to consider these experiences in the light of the readings each
week. I also want you to clarify what you see to be the critical points of the week’s readings.
If you have concerns about what you have read I want you to identify these also. Also, please
identify issues in the readings that you want clarified by the class/group. Discussion board
posts are intended to bring up ideas, questions, and issues that we will use to organize our
discussion in class.

Important Dates for Summer 2019 session:
        Please see the following website for a complete list of important dates in The
University of Texas at Austin Calendar: http://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars/18-19..
Evaluation of the Course and Instructor:
        It is the policy of the College of Education that all organized courses will be
evaluated using an appropriate Course Instructor Survey arranged through the
Measurement and Evaluation Center. Consequently, you will be given the
                                                           SED 388: Understanding/treatment Autism
                                                            Fragale – course syllabus, page 2


opportunity to complete a student course evaluation in the last week of the course.
Student evaluations remain anonymous. Neither the instructor nor the teaching
assistant is to be present during the evaluation and neither is to see the answer
sheets until grades have been officially reported. Students have requested that they
be given the opportunity to complete the Course Instructor Survey at the beginning
of the class period to increase the likelihood that all students will participate in the
evaluation process.
Students with Accommodations:
At the beginning of the semester, students with disabilities who need special
accommodations should notify the instructor by presenting a letter prepared by the
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) Office. To ensure that the most appropriate
accommodations can be provided, students should contact the SSD Office at 471-6259.
Website is available at: http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/
Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty:
Students who violate university rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the
University. Policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
Incompletes
Incompletes will be given only in cases of verifiable emergency. In order to receive an
incomplete, the student must have completed at least 75% of the class work and have a
current passing grade. If you have a verifiable emergency at the end of the course, please
contact the professor and we will decide what the best course of action is for you.
University Safety Policy
Please read through the following safety recommendations regarding emergency
evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767,
http://www.utexas.edu/safety
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to
evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement
requires exiting and assembling outside.
    • Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may
         occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when
         entering the building.
    • Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing
         during the first week of class.
    • In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
    • Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
         Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire
         Prevention Services office.
    • Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050

Examinations, Assignments and Grading Structure
(1) KRWL Sheets
You will submit a KRWL Sheet for each class. By 12pm of class day (1 hour before class)
submit the “KRW” (what you already Know, Reading focus, and what you Want to know) so
that I can review these prior to class on Canvas. The earlier you can submit these the better,
but I understand the time crunch of summer courses. You will complete the “L” (what you
Learned) at the end of class and turn in on Canvas. The KRWL sheet will include:
     • K: Know: Explain what you already know about the topic for that day
             o Which parts of the topic you feel you already have a good grasp of?
             o How comfortable are you with it – Heard about it? Experienced it
                 personally?
             o Please share personal experience stories if you have them
     •   R: Reading focus: What is the main idea from the assigned reading?
             o Why do you think I assigned this reading (what are you supposed to get out
                 of it, in context of the subject for that class)
             o What ideas are new to you or especially interesting?
     •   W: Want to know: Please list at least 2 things you’d like to know/learn more about
             o Please be specific if you can – we will go over the general strategies from the
                 readings, so please explain more about either the context or population or
                 specific component of a strategy/topic you are interested in learning more
                 about
             o What remaining questions do you have after reading assigned materials?
     •   L: Learned: Please list at least 2 things you learned in class that day
             o These can be big or little things – focus on what was most relevant to you
                 from the class for that day
             o If relevant, discuss how what you learned might apply to what you do
All four parts must be turned in to receive any points. There are 12 assigned, two of the
lowest grades will be dropped.
3 points each (30 points total)
Note: Here’s my suggestion to approaching this assignment…
     1. BEFORE reading, skim over the assigned readings to get a feel for the topic. Fill out
         the “know” section.
     2. Read the assigned readings with the questions for the “Reading focus” in mind. Fill
         out the Reading focus section during or after reading.
     3. Take a few minutes (10, perhaps) to look over what you have filled out in
         conjunction with what you just read. Then fill out the “Want to know” section after
         allowing your brain to process the topic as a whole.
(2) In-Class Application Activities (ICAA)
There will usually be a brief applied activity in class. These may take place at any point
during the class (i.e., may be based strictly off the readings at the beginning of class or
following presentation of class materials that day). Students are expected to be prepared for
                                                              SED 388: Understanding/treatment Autism
                                                               Fragale – course syllabus, page 4


these by doing the course readings and attending to material covered in class. There will
NOT be any makeups for ICAAs. If you are not present you cannot do the ICAA.
2 points each (20 points total)
(3) Applied Project
You will be required to select one intervention you are interested in learning more about.
You will complete a training on your topic (done online), and then create a brief summary
sheet on your intervention strategy. This will cover a brief description of your strategy as
well as how to apply this in the classroom/other contexts as relevant. At the end of the
semester, we will put this together in a booklet as a useful tool for you to take away. You
will also prepare a brief scenario/activity for the class to complete on our last class day. A
full rubric will be posted on Canvas with details to this assignment.
20 points
(4) Summary quizzes
Three summary quizzes will be given during the semester. Each summary quiz will have 2
essay questions for you to complete. These quizzes will be geared to evaluate your
knowledge of the assigned readings and will cover readings from the previous classes up
until that date.
10 points each (30 points total)
Grading Structure
Grades will be calculated in the following manner:
         KRWL Sheets                             30 points
         In-Class Application Activities         20 points
         Applied Project                         20 points
         Summary Quizzes                         30 points
         Total:                                  100 points
Final Grades
     • A = 90% - 100%
     • B = 79% - 89%
     • C = 68% - 88%
     • D = 57% - 67%
     • F = 56% or below
