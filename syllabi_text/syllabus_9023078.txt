Course Description.
The importance of brand storytelling continues to grow with new modes of message sharing. As more brands
move to a story/content marketing approach, this class shows students how to create tomorrow’s engaging,
sharable content. The course examines how classic elements of storytelling, semiotics, and symbolism can be
used to create and manage a modern brand’s story and “meaning.” Students will create visual, verbal, and
video examples of brand storytelling that go beyond traditional advertising and PR.


Course Outcomes.
By the end of this course, you should demonstrate an understanding of how to:
     Think of brands in terms of story
     Analyze, construct, and manage meaning for brands
     Create a strategic brand story platform that works in a variety of media
     Execute an ongoing content marketing plan
Coursework.
Module Projects: In each learning module, you'll be assigned various projects to learn the theoretical
fundamentals as well as practical skills of modern brand communication. Each module includes projects,
quizzes, and a capstone piece to demonstrate both your theoretical and hands-on skills.
Grades.
Here’s how your final course grade will be calculated:
100% = 4 Module Projects (25% each; graded)
Final letter grades are calculated according to these cutoffs—no exceptions:
A = 94 to 100 A- = 90 to <94 B+ = 87 to <90 B = 87 to <84 B- = 84 to <80 C+ = 80 to <77 C = 77 to <74
 C- = 74 to <70 D+ = 70 to <67 D = 67 to <64 D- = 64 to <61 F = 61 to 0
Policies:
Late Work
As a budding professional in a deadline-driven industry, you are expected to complete every module and
project on time – no exceptions. All projects are due on Canvas at the date and time indicated on the Class
Calendar.
Emergencies happen, so you are allowed one “Late Pass” without penalty, which gives you an additional 2
days (48 hours) to complete a single project. Thereafter, you will not be able to turn in any late projects under
any circumstances, unless you already have a prior exemption for a Religious Holy Day, a school-sponsored
trip, or a doctor's note, obituary, or other serious issue that you can document with a written excuse.
To use your Late Pass, please contact both the teacher and teaching assistant via e-mail BEFORE the project
is due.
Scholastic Dishonesty
The Stan Richards School of Advertising and Public Relations has no tolerance for acts of scholastic
dishonesty. Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course an/or dismissal from the University. Please familiarize yourself
