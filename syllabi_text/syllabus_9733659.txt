                                     Course Description
This course is designed for intermediate and experienced communications, PR, and advertising stu-
dents who are seeking a greater understanding of social enterprises and how to effectively brand those
social enterprises. This course will focus specifically on the for-profit sector of social enterprises seek-
ing to balance purpose and profit. The balance of those foundational elements is delicate and critical.
Learning how to effectively communicate them reinforces the trust and ultimate success of a brand.
A growing number of consumers want to incorporate some aspect of, “giving back” through their every
purchase. Companies want to meet that demand and are looking for the skilled individuals to communi-
cate those cause-based impacts. In-class instruction, industry leader guest interviews, and a semester
project will serve to provide an overview of social entrepreneurship, industry trends, and best practices
in branding related to cause marketing and corporate social responsibility.
    “Humanity’s greatest advances are not in its discoveries but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity.”

This class will be graded using the plus/minus grading system, as outlined by the university’s provost of-
fice (http://www.utexas.edu/provost/planning/plus-minus/) I will NOT be rounding up percentage grades
or points. So if you earn an 89.6% that translates into a B+ and will not be rounded up to 90% (an A-).
Any questions or concerns about a grade must be presented in writing within seven (7) days after the
grade is announced or posted. I will not discuss grades after this seven-day period.
When we grade your work, you start with zero points. You do not start with 100 percent and then lose
points based on mistakes you might make. Your final points represent the total points earned for that
assignment, not the number of points “taken away” for errors or omissions.
