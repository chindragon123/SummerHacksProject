Course Summary
ACC 380K.2 is a graduate course covering advanced accounting topics. It largely involves the
accounting for more “complicated” entities than you have seen in your prior coursework. We will
spend the vast majority of our time on topics related to intercorporate investments, mergers and
acquisitions, and consolidation of controlled entities, both domestic and foreign. The remaining
material will focus on miscellaneous items like interim and segment reporting.
Compared to ACC 380K.1 (Intermediate), we will examine fewer topics, but those that we do examine
will be covered in more depth. Further, the transactions and events we focus on are often complex,
which makes the accounting complex, which is why these topics are reserved for “advanced”
accounting.
Required Course Materials
1. Advanced Accounting, 3rd Edition, by Robert F. Halsey and Patrick E. Hopkins, Cambridge
    Business Publishers.
2. Course Packet – contains lecture notes, background information, and questions and financial
    statement excerpts we will use in class. You can purchase a printed version of this packet in the
    GSB copy center.
Financial calculator – A calculator with time value of money capabilities is encouraged.

ACC 380K.2                                                                                 Fall 2018
Grading
Course grades are determined by the following weighted average of quizzes, the case, and exams:
            Component                                Percent
            Quizzes                                     15%
            Case                                        10%
            Exam 1                                      25%
            Exam 2                                      25%
            Exam 3                                      25%
               Total                                   100%
    Quizzes – There will be 12 quizzes throughout the semester based on material from lectures and/or
    the textbook and the course packet. These assignments will be completed and graded online using
    Canvas. Ten quizzes will be due after we cover the relevant material in class. Two quizzes (quiz 6
    and quiz 8) will be completed via Canvas by 9:00 am on the due date before class based upon your
    assigned reading material. The purpose of these two quizzes is to encourage to read ahead of time.
    All other quizzes will be due by 5:00 pm (central time) on the due date.
    Case – There will be a case graded on the quality and accuracy of your answers. The case will be
    completed in groups of three. No specific questions as to the application of the material on the
    case will be answered during office hours or via email. Your discussions and conclusions for the
    case should be limited to your group members only. No late assignments will be accepted. The due
    dates for the case is noted below.
    Exams – There will be three exams. All exams will be administered in class and no make-ups will
    be given. Medical and family emergencies and University–sponsored events are the only valid
    reasons for missing an exam. In such instances, you must provide supporting documentation (e.g.,
    signed note from your physician). If you miss an exam and you have a valid and documented
    reason for missing it, your grade will be determined by increased weight on the other exams. If
    you do not have a valid and documented reason for missing an exam, you will receive a zero on the
    exam.
I will use plus/minus grading (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, etc.) for this class. The MPA office has suggested
an average GPA between 3.4 and 3.6 for the course. I will keep you updated throughout the semester
on where you stand in terms of your total grade.
Grading Questions or Appeals – If you feel a grading error exists on any of the above grade
components, you will have one week from the date the grade is posted on Canvas and/or available for
pickup to let me know and have the matter resolved. After this time there will be no adjustments to
your grade.

Web site and e-mail
    E-mail. I encourage you to communicate with me by e-mail (john.mcinnis@mccombs.utexas.edu).
    Web page. I will use Canvas to post important course materials and announcements. You can log
    on to Canvas at http://canvas.utexas.edu/. I will make course announcements periodically via
    Canvas, so it is important that you have an active e-mail address with the University.
Professional Conduct
I expect you to behave professionally. Professional conduct, as it relates to this class, involves:
    1.  Arriving to class on time
    2.  Preparing for class in advance
    3.  Putting away all cell phones, tablets, and laptops unless told otherwise
    4.  Keeping personal breaks during class to an absolute minimum
    5.  Refraining from side conversations or other disruptive behavior
    6.  Being respectful toward your fellow peers and the McCombs Faculty

Scholastic Dishonesty
The Department of Accounting has no tolerance for acts of scholastic dishonesty. The responsibilities
of both students and faculty with regard to scholastic dishonesty are described in detail in the
department’s Policy Statement on Scholastic Dishonesty
(https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/MPA/Student-Codes-of-Ethics).
One of the faculty responsibilities is “to communicate clearly in writing the instructions for each
assignment.” Following are the instructions for each type of assignment in this course.
Quizzes – Quiz answers should be based upon your own work. Each student will have similar
questions, but the facts and answers will be randomized. Thus, doing the quiz with a friend will likely
prove unproductive and may hurt your grade because your answers will differ.
Case – You are allowed to consult with fellow group members for this assignment and NO ONE
ELSE. Copying solutions from any source is not permitted. Violation of this policy will be treated
as an act of scholastic dishonestly. [On a related note, I am willing to discuss course material with you,
but I will not directly apply that material to the case for you in or out of class. The whole point of the
case is for you to practice applying your knowledge to a new situation without my help.]
Exams – The exams are closed book and closed notes. The only materials that are permitted are blank
paper, pen or pencil, a calculator, and a 3x5 card with anything written or typed on it that you want.
Students are prohibited from using words or formulas that are stored in programmable calculators.
Students who have taken an exam are prohibited from discussing the exam with students who have not
yet taken the exam. This prohibition applies to any students in any sections of this course. Violation of
this policy will be treated as an act of scholastic dishonestly.
    Under no circumstances should you use any materials (course packets, notes, etc.)
    obtained from students who have already completed this course. Such usage will
    constitute scholastic dishonesty for both borrower and lender.
    Evidence of any act of scholastic dishonesty will be forwarded to the Dean of Students
    and a grade of “F” will be assigned in the course.

Additional Disclosures
        Website Privacy Disclosure required by the University: Password-protected class sites
        are available for all accredited courses taught at The University. Syllabi, handouts, assignments
        and other resources are types of information that may be available within these sites. Site
        activities could include exchanging e-mail, engaging in class discussions and chats, and
        exchanging files. In addition, class e-mail rosters are a component of the sites. Students who do
        not want their names included in these electronic class rosters must restrict their directory

        directory information see: http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi00-
        01/app/appc09.html
Religious Holy Day procedures: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending
absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must
miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy
day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after
the absence.
Commitment to students with disabilities: The University of Texas at Austin
provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with
disabilities. For more information, contact the Division of Diversity and Community
Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259,

Campus Safety
Please note the following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of
Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/:
 Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
    buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
    assembling outside.
 Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
    Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
 Students requiring assistance in evacuation should inform their instructor in writing during the first
    week of class.
 In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors.
 Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The
    University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
 Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL): 512-232-5050
 Further information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be
    found at: www.utexas.edu/emergency.
