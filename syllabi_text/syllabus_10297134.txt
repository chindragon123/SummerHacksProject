Description
Afro-Latinidad troubles not only notions of Blackness and Latinidad, but also the
hegemony of US-centered Black studies in African Diaspora Studies, and
underrepresentation of African descent narratives in Latin American Studies and
transnational activisms. Across Latin America and within the US, portrayals of
Latinxs are often inaccurate or stereotypical, advancing the idea that most Latinxs are
solely of European or indigenous descent, whereas US Black studies is often blind to
Latinidad as a constitutive experience of Afro-Latinxs in the US.
This course explores questions of ethnic identity formation, ethnic-racial relations,
neoliberalism, immigration, imperialism, and social (in)justice across the Americas
that affect ethnic and national groups in uneven ways. The course asks: what does
Latinidad mean? How does Afro-Latinidad travel and is recognized or denied across
different countries and communities in the Diaspora? What are some
connections/differences/commonalities in the ways that populations of Afro-Latino
descendent and indigenous-Latino descent experience social injustice both in the US
and in countries in Latin America? How have Black and Brown Latino/as established
solidarity among themselves and with white Latinos in community-building and in
struggles across differences?
The course offers historical context and concepts for students of all racial and ethnic
background to ask how multiple identities and interconnected systems of oppression
have shaped and affect their personal lives, their communities, as well as the social
and cultural experiences of Afro and Indigenous descent populations in Latin America
and in the US. Students will research examples of Afro-Latinx cultures and social
movements for inspiration. This is a project-driven course that will involve research,
translating research into creative materials, and proposing an intervention for
community/political engagement. We will use scholarly, multimedia, film,
journalistic, and artistic resources. No textbook required.
Instructor
Priscilla Vaz, PhD in Geography at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Postdoctoral Fellow- Department of Black and Diaspora Studies & the Department
Latino/a Studies at the University of Texas.


She is an Afro-Latina feminist, popular educator and activist-scholar interested Black
radical traditions, Black community economies, Afro-feminisms, and decolonial
praxis. She has long been interested in the intersection of class, race, and gender in
Brazilian society and their resulting geographical patterns of racialized uneven
economic geographies. She holds a BA in Sociology and Ethnic Studies from the
University of Sao Paulo, and MA and a PhD in Geography from University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Over the past fifteen years she has done grassroots work with
under-served communities of color in Brazil
Advice for success in the course: This course is open to and welcomes students of
all backgrounds and ethnic/social identities who are interested in intercultural
dialogue, social justice and identity studies in and across the fields of Latinx, Latin
American, Black and American Studies. Lessons are designed to be interactive and
hold safe and inspiring space for diverse kinds of learners. Besides close reading and
student-facilitated discussions of academic and journalistic texts, we will use poetry,
Theatre of the Oppressed games/exercises, video collages, music, visual art, and
journaling as part of our learning experiences. In order to succeed in this learning
journey, you are encouraged to practice deep listening, being open and honest to self-
inquiry, stretching oneself out of one’s comfort zone, out of your cultural boundaries
to find points of commonality with the social experiences of others. My hope is that
learners discover that academic rigor is both the requirement for and a targeted
product of engagement with research, creativity, and community engagement.
        You are encouraged to schedule routine in-person and online meetings with
instructor and to discuss their individual progress at least once a month.
Assessment
A) Readings and Summaries
You will be graded on a total of two summaries or written responses to the
readings. It should include 1-2 pgs- long response, summarizing the main arguments
authors make in texts, identifying key words, defining key concepts and writing two
questions for class discussion of the texts. The purpose of this exercise is to practice
writing effective summaries, and to help in your preparations for class discussion.
Each summary is worth 100 points comprising a total of 200 points (Each is worth 10
% of final grade).
_____________________________________________________________________
B) Facilitation of reading discussions: each trio of students will facilitate a few 20-
min class discussion about a particular reading. Trios will rotate. Your trio should
expect to facilitate a class discussion for every 4 ou 5 readings that have been
assigned, since there are about 12 students enrolled in the class. Facilitation is worth
10% of grade. Everyone can sign-up for trios in class, or if you have a trio, the three
of you can go ahead and sign-up here in this
link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iB9DbCcrZSj8CFHaGl3zTX4fCYcDmIe
WuqXTCJdwo1M/edit?usp=sharing (Links to an external site.)
We will try to keep the same trio through the semester.

C) Participation involves coming prepared to engage actively and productively, raise
questions, make comments, share thoughts/insights, listen actively and respectfully. It
will comprise 10% of your grade. Participation grade will be discussed during
scheduled office hours biweekly with each student throughout the course.

D) Projects: you will complete three projecst during this course that build-up on your
learning journey. This project will comprise three components/parts, totaling 60% of
your grade.
Project 1: Do an interview: You will prepare and record a brief semi-structured
interview (face to face or via skype- 20min max) with individuals who have stories to
share about their Afro-Latinx experience either in the US or in Latin America. Based
on your interview, research and class discussions, you will do a one-two page free-
write reflection piece to report and reflect on what you have learned from the
interview (20% of your grade; 100 points).
    •   Larger interview question: What does it mean to be Afro-Latinx? What are
        some of the cultural, social, political experiences of Afro-Latinxs in the US
        and/or Latin America?
You will need to prepare at least two more questions for the interview and schedule
office hours to discuss them before you carry out the interview.
Project 2. Write a research paper: building on your interview and research on
Afro-Latinidades in the US and/or Latin America, write a research paper
that incorporates detailed description and in-depth analysis of social injustice issues
affecting Afro-Latinxs communities. Examples should be either historical or be
happening in the present. You will be asked to turn to reputable scholarly and news
sources, in addition to class texts. The research paper should be at least 7 double
space pages, and not exceed 10 double-spaced pages.(font 12; Times New Roman).
Project 3. Do a creative piece or a political intervention. Drawing on your research
on the cultural, political and social experiences of Afro-Latinx communities, and on
the study of coalitions of Brown, Black, White people in the US and/or Latin
America, hopefully you will feel inspired to translate your research into either a
creative piece or a political intervention. The creative piece could be done in any
format- drawing, music, poetry, performance, zines, video- The goals is to share your
learning journey in the course through a creative mean. You will not be assessed by
any specific aesthetic standard. Instead, you will be assessed by your openness to
express creatively your research and learning in the class. Creative pieces will be
presented in class.


Alternatively, you could propose any activity inside or outside campus that seeks
to promote intercultural dialogue and racial/social justice. For instance, you could
create and publicize pro-diversity posters, organize a film screening followed by a
debate, write a letter to university leadership in support of diversity/reparations to
university leadership, or whatever you choose to do towards transformative justice,
however small. You are encouraged to schedule office hours to have support to
design your intervention, to assess its feasibility, relevance and appropriateness. You
will need to document it (photos, for example), and write 1-2 -page reflection on the
experience or talk about it in class. Whichever you choose, either the creative piece or
the political intervention, it will be worth (20% of your grade; 100 points).
All three projects are to be thought of as intertwined with one another, building
up on one another. They can be in progress simultaneously, and you are welcome
to seek feedback from instructor and peers as your projects progress.

Honor Code
A key part of this observance is to be extremely careful about plagiarism. The
Instrument of Student Judicial Governance defines plagiarism as “deliberate or
reckless representation of another's words, thoughts, or ideas as one's own without
attribution in connection with submission of academic work, whether graded or
otherwise.
I suggest that in writing your assignments, you are very careful about taking notes,
and refrain from cutting and pasting from other sources – even if your intention is to
paraphrase and cite those sources. You must quote and cite any words that are not
your own, and any paraphrased ideas or information must be attributed to their source.
