Course Description: Spanning almost a century of Russian literature, this course highlights a gallery
of fictional and real rebels and revolutionaries. Were they heroes and martyrs who sacrificed their lives
to improve the lot of others? Or unscrupulous and manipulative individuals who disguised their thirst
for power behind an agenda of societal betterment? From Pushkin’s portrayal of Emelian Pugachev’s
rebellion in the 1770s to Nechaev’s organized revolutionary group, which inspired Dostoevsky’s
Demons, to Bakunin’s writings and memoirs of notorious revolutionaries and intelligentsia’s responses
to the “revolutionary virus,” the array of representations of rebels and revolutionaries simultaneously
served as a reflection of their popular perception and formed the reading public’s opinion on these
issues. We will supplement textual analysis of prose and poetry with the study of historical documents
in order to understand the complex historical, moral, and cultural dimensions of such enduring
phenomena as revolution, rebellion, and terrorism.

Class Attendance: Daily class attendance is required. You are expected to read all assigned texts
before the class and to participate actively in the discussion. According to the General Information
catalog, “[a] student who is absent from a class or examination for the observance of a religious
holy day may complete the work issued within a reasonable time after the absence, if proper
notice has been given” (page 71). The deadline for notification of such an absence is four days prior
to the class absence or the first class day for religious holy days that fall within the first two weeks
of the semester.
Special Accommodations: At the beginning of the semester, students with disabilities who need
special accommodations should notify the instructor by presenting a letter prepared by the
Services for Students with Disabilities Office. To ensure that the most appropriate
accommodations can be provided, students should contact the SSD Office at 471-6259 or 471-4641

Policy on Scholastic Dishonesty: Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are


subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from
the University. Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the
University, policies on scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. Refer to the Student Judicial
Services website for official University policies and procedures on scholastic dishonesty.
Grade Evaluations:
a. Two Response Papers (30%): Response papers should reflect your thinking on assigned
reading. Format: 2-3 pages (at least 1,000 words), Times New Roman, 12 pt. You will be evaluated on
the depth and quality of your reflections, clarity of style, and cohesiveness of argumentation. After you
receive your paper back, you will have a week to revise and resubmit it, if desired. Detailed instructions
will be provided a week before the draft is due.
b. Two In-Class Exams (50% total): Each exam will test your knowledge of material discussed in
class and studied independently at home. Exams will include ID, multiple-choice, and essay questions.
First in-class exam (40 min) – 20%
Final in-class exam (75 min) – 30%
c. Presentation (10%): In pairs, you will prepare a 10-15-minute oral presentation on one of the topics
offered at the beginning of the semester. You will discuss your presentation with your instructor no later
than one week in advance. Graduate students will prepare to teach or co-teach during one class
meeting. Two meetings with your instructor are required (one before the class and one after). More
instructions to follow.
e. Participation (10%): Your instructor will determine this part of the grade based on your
preparedness and participation in class. There are three components of success: regular attendance,
advance reading/preparation of assigned materials, and insightful, well-formulated comments during
discussions. Important: Bring your text and reading diary to each class! In the diary, you will record
your thoughts, questions, and observations while reading the assigned pieces. It is tremendously
helpful when you are generating ideas for your papers and prepare for exams. Let me know if you have
any questions.
