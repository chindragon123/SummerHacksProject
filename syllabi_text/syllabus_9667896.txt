IX. Canvas Usage
  • This course uses Canvas, a Web-based course management system in which a password-protected site
     is created for each course. Student enrollments in each course are updated each evening. Canvas can be
     used to distribute course materials, to communicate and collaborate online, to post grades (using
     Grades), and to submit HW thorough Canvas or JOSHU site (www.laits.utexas.edu/japanese/joshu/)
  • You will be responsible for checking the Canvas EVERY DAY for class work and announcements. As
     with all computer systems, there are occasional scheduled downtimes as well as unanticipated
     disruptions. Notification of these disruptions will be posted on the Canvas login page. Scheduled
     downtimes are not an excuse for late work. However, if there is an unscheduled downtime for a
     significant period of time, I will make an adjustment if it occurs close to the due date.
  • Canvas is available at http://canvas.utexas.edu. Support is provided by the ITS Help Desk at 475-9400.
X. Studying Japanese
  • In learning a foreign language, it is important to study every day. You are expected to spend a lot of
     hours besides your classes. You should NOT expect to learn the language simply by attending the class
     activities. Language learning requires a lot of time to constant review of previously learned material.
  • Come PREPARED. Please read appropriate textbook pages BEFORE class to facilitate your
     understanding of the lectures and participation in class activities.
  • Use Japanese whenever possible. Find some Japanese related things interest you.
     Try to use phrases you have learned with your classmates or your Japanese friends.
  • Listen to the Yookoso Textbook Audio Program
  • Listen to the Japanese language as much as possible. (Even though you do not understand, listening to
     Japanese will help you to familiar with the sounds, intonation, and vocabulary.) Develop a systematic
     way of organizing the increasingly large amounts of materials for which you will be responsible.
  • Join the Japanese related clubs if you have extra time.

Emergency Communications
Emergencies may range from inclement weather, to building evacuations, to campus closures, and the
university has a variety of tools to communicate with the public in the event of these and other possible
emergencies. Depending on the type of emergency, we may use some or all of the following tools to
communicate with faculty, staff and students:
Siren System
This system is tested around noon on the first Wednesday of every month, and delivers a siren warning and
public address in the event of certain outdoor emergencies.
Emergency Web Site
You may want to bookmark the emergency Web site
https://www.utexas.edu/emergency/
https://emergency.utexas.edu/resources
because it is updated with information during actual emergencies or campus closures.
Local Press and Social Media
University Communications staff send emergency information to the press and update social media with
public safety messages. Because of the transient nature of our population, the university depends a great
deal on the press and social media to keep students, faculty, and staff informed during campus emergencies.
Pager System
Our campus first responders, resident advisors, and some building managers are part of the AWACS paging
system. The pagers send text messages about emergencies on campus and alert city responders (APD, AFD,
EMS, Office of Emergency Management, etc.) to campus crisis situations.
Fire Panel Systems


Residence halls are equipped with fire panel systems that have a public address capability. Resident advisors
are trained to use these systems in emergencies in order to make announcements to the entire building
regarding evacuation, shelter in place, etc.
Text Alerts
The university collects cell phone numbers from members of the campus community for emergency text
messages. Sign up for campus text alerts online:
https://emergency.utexas.edu/preparedness/communication-tools
University Group E-mail
During emergencies, UT Safety Alert sends an “urgent” group e-mail to every student, faculty and staff
member. The e-mail directs individuals to the emergency Web site for additional information and
instruction.
Voicemail to Office Telephones
This tool leaves a voice message on every faculty and staff member’s office phone on campus.
Cable TV
Residence halls and several of our public gathering places have cable televisions where emergency
announcements get posted.
Public Safety Patrol Car Announcements
UTPD patrol cars are equipped with PA systems, which officers can use to provide instructions to
pedestrians during emergencies.
Campus Carry Information for students (Please read)
https://utexas.app.box.com/v/cc-info-sheet-students
Campus Carry Basics (PDF)
https://utexas.app.box.com/v/campus-carry-the-basics
University Emergency Information Line — 512-232-9999
Students, faculty, and staff can call this main number for information about campus closures.
The implementation of each tool described above is assigned to an individual who has at least two backups who can
also carry out the communications task. Individuals with electronic communication tools assigned to them have
remote access (from their homes, etc.) to those tools. The police department and the associate vice president for
Campus Safety and Security are typically the ones who deliver emergency information to university administration.
Upon considering this information, administration develops the messages and activates campus-wide
communications. The only exceptions to this are the sirens and pager system, which are activated directly by UTPD in
extremely urgent situations where immediate action is required.
