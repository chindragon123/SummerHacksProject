Course description: M408C is the standard first-semester calculus course. It is directed at students in
the natural sciences and engineering. The emphasis in this course is on problem solving, not the theory of
analysis.
The syllabus for M408C includes most of the basic topics in the theory of functions of a real variable:
algebraic, trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions and their limits, continuity, derivatives,
maxima and minima, integration, area under a curve, and volumes of revolution.
Prerequisite and degree relevance: An appropriate score on the mathematics placement exam or Math-
ematics 305G with a grade of at least B-.
Math majors are required to take both M408C and M408D (or either the equivalent sequence M408K,
M408L, M408M; or the equivalent sequence M408N, M408S, M408M). Mathematics majors are required to
make grades of C- or better in each of these courses.
408C may not be counted by students with credit for any of Mathematics 403K, 408K, 408N, or 408L.
Attendance policy: Attendance will not be taken but you are advised to attend all lectures and discussion
sessions.
Homework: Homework will be assigned as follows:
   2. Homework will be assigned on Quest once a week on Mondays and will account for 15% of your overall
      grade. The 2 lowest scores will be dropped.
    3 Selected problems from your textbook will be assigned on Canvas but will not be graded. You will
      discuss most of these problems with your TA but you are encouraged to try the problems on your own.
Please note that Quest homework will be due on Mondays at 11:59 pm.
Quizzes: Quizzes will be assigned on Canvas every Thursday (except for exam weeks) at 4 pm. You will
have 24 hours to complete and submit your completed quiz via Canvas. These will account for 10 % of your
overall grade. I will drop the lowest quiz score.
Exams: There will be two midterm exams, each of which will account for 25% of our overall grade. You
will have 24 hours to complete and submit your completed exam via Canvas. The final exam will be in
two parts; a multiple choice part which will be administered via Quest and a free-response part which will
be assigned on Canvas. You will have 48-hours to complete both exams and submit for grading. Your final
exam score will replace your lowest midterm score only if the former is better than the latter.

Grade distribution:
Midterm Exams: 50%.
Homework: 15%
Quizzes: 10%
Final exam: 25%
Make-up policy: Some assignments are dropped to accommodate illnesses, emergencies, and other legiti-
mate reasons that prevent assignment completion or submission. For this reason, there will be no make-up
quizzes or exams. Please also note that late submission of homework assignments will not be permitted.
Grade scale: Letter grades will be assigned according to the scale: A (100-93), A- (92-90), B+ (89-87), B
(86-83), B- (82-80), C+ (79-77), C (76-73), C- (72-70), D+ (69-67), D (66-63), D- (62-60), F (59-0).
Email policy: All emails should be sent through Canvas. If you choose to send an email to my email
address (smanukure@math.utexas.edu), please include your UT EID and the unique number of the section
you are in. Please note that it is impossible to teach mathematics via email so please do not email me
mathematics problems.
Calculator policy: You can use calculators on the homework but they will not be allowed on quizzes or
exams.

Introduction to Quest: Homework assignments for this course will be generated via Quest from a data
bank of questions developed specifically for the course. These questions are based, for most part, on ones
in the text. Each question in the bank is an algorithm that produces many different versions of the same
question, so is ideally adapted to producing individualized homework assignments and exams.
At the heart of Quest is a computer program the takes the data bank and generates homework which you
download from the web, work on, and then return your answers again using the web. Answers can be
returned one at a time or several at a time. These answers are checked by the computer, and you are then
notified immediately of the correctness or incorrectness of your answers. Multiple attempts at answering
a given question are allowed, but there is a penalty for incorrect answers. The computer will take
track of your scores on the assignments.
There are some numerical questions requiring a numerical answer. To be scored as correct, a numerical
answer must be within 1% of the computer’s answer.
It is your responsibility to submit your Quest HW before the due date. Please try to submit the answer as
you work the problems. Waiting until the last minute or hour may result in an inability to submit answers.
QUEST instructional charge: This course makes use of the web-based Quest content delivery and
homework server system maintained by the College of Natural Sciences. This homework service will require
a $30 charge per student for its use, which goes toward the maintenance and operation of the resource.

 Quantitative reasoning: This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning
courses are designed to prepare you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative
arguments you will regularly encounter in your professional life. So, this course may be used to fulfill the
mathematics component of the university core curriculum and addresses the following three core objectives
established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking
skills, and empirical and quantitative skills.
