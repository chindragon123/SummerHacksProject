Course Description:
This course is taught in English and is an upper-division course.
It carries the Global Culture flag.
You will acquaint yourself with Rome and a passage of time in the Eternal City through
frequent field trips. You will interactively explore and analyze Italian history and social
changes from the unification of Italy to the new immigration and current events. The
course will concentrate on theater, documentary-films, and works of imaginative prose,
poetry, and art, in order to offer an overview of modern and contemporary Italian
history with a focus specifically on Rome and its social and cultural significance. A
number of the classes will be enriched by the visits of some of the writers and filmmaker
whose works we will be studying.
Global Culture
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to
increase students’ familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. Students
should therefore expect a substantial portion of the grade to come from assignments
covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one non-U.S. cultural group, past
or present.
