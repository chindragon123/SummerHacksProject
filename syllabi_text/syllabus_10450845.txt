CZ 412K: SECOND-YEAR CZECH I                                     UNIQUE: 82247
Summer 2020
Class time:            M-F 1-2pm, 2:30-3:30pm
Instructor:            Christian Hilchey (​hilchey@utexas.edu​)
Office Hours:          on Zoom, by appointment
Course Website:        http://canvas.utexas.edu/
Course Description:​ This is a course in intermediate Czech. It is intended to help
students further develop language skills after a typical 1st-year sequence. This course
will place strong emphasis on reading, writing, speaking, and listening.​ ​At the end of the
course, students should be able to:
    ● speak and create language about a variety of basic topics, e.g. – yourself, your
        family, food, relationships, places we live and go to, appearance, cleaning and
        chores, and wishes/desires.
    ● listen and respond to intermediate-level connected speech on these topics
    ● read intermediate-level texts with the help of a dictionary
    ● write basic essays and other connected written texts
Required Texts:        Čeština Expres 3​ – Lída Holá and Pavla Bořilová
                       Czech: An Esssential Grammar​ – James Naughton
Prerequisites: ​Prerequisites for this course are CZ 506, 507 or instructor permission.
Attendance and Participation: This course meets twice a day, each for one hour, five
days a week. We will be meeting online in Zoom and you will receive a link to these
meetings in Canvas announcements. We will cover a lot of material every single day,
and so attendance is mandatory. Attendance and participation form a crucial component
of your grade (15%), and therefore students should make every effort to attend every
class, arrive on time, and participate in the class activities. It is in your best interest to
pay attention and ask questions in class, as this is your best opportunity to practice
Czech. Each unexcused absence after the first absence will result in a reduction of the
final grade by 3% up to a maximum of 15% of the final grade (i.e. the entire attendance
grade). Lateness (over 5 minutes) will count as half an absence.
Homework Assignments: ​You will have homework assignments for nearly every class.
All homework assignments must be completed using Google Docs and submitted over
Canvas. Our textbook contains a key at the end with the answers to all homework
exercises. After completing the exercises assigned for the day, you will receive a key to
the homework so you can correct them. Please correct your assignments using track
changes/suggesting in Google Docs so that I can see what problems you are having. A
complete homework assignment with no major problems will receive a √+ (100%);
homework assignments that are complete but contain frequent errors and show some
sign of incomplete understanding of the material will receive a √ (80%); assignments


that are missing sections or contain significant and consistent major errors will receive a
√- (50%). Late homework assignments will not be accepted, except in cases of an
excused absence.
Essays: ​You will write 7 essays during the course of the semester. You will receive a
set of questions for each essay. While these questions are meant to guide your essays,
your essays should be standalone works. In other words, they should be connected
texts which do not assume the reader has any knowledge of the questions. Essays
must be at least 200 words. They should be submitted on Canvas as a Google Doc.
Essays will be corrected by the instructor. Essay due dates will be listed on Canvas and
on the course schedule.
Presentations: All presentations will be conducted asynchronously (i.e. not during our
scheduled class). You will prepare a presentation using the presentation tool of their
choosing (Powerpoint, Google Slides, Prezi) and complete a screen recording of their
presentation. Presentations should be 4-5 minutes and should include pictures and
optionally text in Czech (please refrain from using the text of the questions on your
slides). If you use any specialized words or vocabulary in your presentation, you should
define these somewhere on your slides (e.g. a small box in the corner of the slide).
Please do not use any memes or other content with English in them (you are, however,
free to use or make your own Czech meme content). You will be required to post these
videos to a Canvas discussion board. Everyone will be required to ask (in writing) at
least one relevant question about each presentation and presenters will respond to
these questions.
Unit Quizzes: After each unit there will be a short quiz covering the topics we have
covered during the lesson. Tests will be timed. You are on your honor not to utilize any
resources during these unit quizzes.
Vocabulary Quizzes: Learning new vocabulary items is a crucial aspect of learning a
foreign language. Every day there will be a list with 20-25 vocabulary list items in the
Pre-class (​Před hodinou​) section of each daily module on Canvas. You should learn
these words before the start of class. Each module will also contain a brief timed
vocabulary quiz on some subset of these items. You must complete these vocabulary
quizzes before the start of class for a given module. You will only have one chance to
complete these quizzes, so make sure you study the words sufficiently. You are on your
honor not to utilize any resources during these vocabulary quizzes.
Daily Video Assignments: ​We will be taking a tour of Czech history (and humor) using
the Czech television serious ​Dějiny udatného českého národa.​ You will receive a
transcript for each of these episodes. These videos are three minutes long and the
accompanying text will be approximately 200-250 words. You will be responsible for
translating these texts and answering a few questions at the end. Every week you will
be assigned a different partner to work with and complete these assignments together


asynchronously over Zoom. In some instances I may ask you to record your session
and upload it to Canvas.
Assessment and Grading: ​Final grades will be determined as follows:
         Attendance/Participation                  15%
         Homework                                  15%
         Essays                                    15%
         Presentations                             15%
         Unit Quizzes                              10%
         Vocabulary Quizzes                        15%
         Daily Video Assignments                   15%
         Total                                     100%
Online Materials: ​Course materials will often be made available on the course website
(​http://canvas.utexas.edu​). It is the responsibility of students to check the website for
materials, including homework assignments, study guides, etc.
Online dictionaries and reference works
http://slovniky.lingea.cz/
http://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/
Google Translate: ​Google translate can be a useful tool at times to figure out how to
say things or translate a tricky phrase. However, it also makes mistakes or uses
language forms that you are not familiar with. In the end, it does not help your Czech
abilities to submit assignments that utilize Google translate. If I have reason to believe
that you have used Google Translate or any other translation tool on your assignments,
you will receive zero credit for these assignments.
