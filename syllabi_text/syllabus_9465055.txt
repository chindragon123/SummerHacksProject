LESS IS.
ARC 694                   Architectural Design | Vertical Studio
University of Texas School of Architecture Francisco Gomes Spring 2019
Class: MWF 1pm-5pm

Course Description
The LESS IS studio will investigate approaches to architecture which begin with
strategies of restraint. Sometimes constraints are extrinsic and imposed from
the situation of a project, be it a limitation of site, construction, or economics.
Nearly always, the author of an architectural work formulates intrinsic limitations
that steer composition, experience, and architectural expression.
Rather than taking “less is more” and “less is a bore,” the judgements disposed
as metaphors, made famous by Mies van der Rohe and Robert Venturi
respectively, at face value the studio will instead begin with the how of designing
with less and move toward the why. Buildings cost a literal fortune, making
limitations a necessity at times, but even in the most expensive projects
expressions of less are used for their cultural value.
There is a strong lineage of doctrines of restraint in the histories of many cultural
endeavors, variously addressing interests of equitable access, local culture,
materiality/physicality, and human-centeredness; more often reacting against
abstraction than pursuing it. In film, the Dogma movement; in cuisine, Farm-to-
Table and the New Nordic Kitchen; in music composition, phase and process
music; and in the fine arts, Arte Povera, all bound possibilities to define value.
The studio will undertake two architectural design problems, each aimed at a
different aspect of working with less. The first project will focus on architectural
expressions arising from the extrinsic constraint of severely limited resources.
The second project will examine the role of intrinsic constraint in architectural
invention within a complex physical environment. Each project will be preceded
by a precedent study.
The studio will have a particular emphasis on visual communication. Design
inquiry though model making (principally by hand) and two-dimensional drawing
(principally with software) will be a strong focus. The crafting of exquisite and
compelling drawings and physical models will be required.

Competition title page
Sited in an existing settlement in the peripheral La Arboleda de Fatima district of
Santa Cruz, Bolivia’s largest city, this project is a competition for the design of a
kindergarten. Organized by ARCHsharing in collaboration with TECHO Bolivia, a         Preschool in Haro, Taller Básico de Arquitectura
humanitarian association that seeks to overcome poverty in Bolivia, the
competition posits the reinhabitation of a site with three derelict buildings to
serve as many as 500 underserved children between the ages of 2 and 5 in the
surrounding neighborhood. The project site is located adjacent to a school,
allowing students there to accompany their younger siblings to the kindergarten
rather than miss school days to look after them when parents can’t.
Following a model-based precedent study of contemporary architectural projects
for the care and education of young children, the design of the architecture
(inclusive of demolition, renovation, and addition) as well design of the site and
a social strategy will be undertaken individually. The project is resource limited:
construction costs are low, the projects will be phased, and the design must
presume construction by low-skilled labor. In addition to a conventional final
review presentation, students will prepare a board to enter their design into the
competition (at a cost of 60 Euro per student). The competition organizers
intend to build the winning entry and have committed to providing each entry
with feedback from the international jury, which includes Eugenia Concha of
                                                                                      Novartis Campus Visitor Center study, Peter Markli

Project Two:            ELDER (8 weeks)
                        Constraint in service of Culture
The second project examines the role of self-imposed limitations in the creation
of the architectural work. Additionally, the influence of the situation/context of
architectural space/object on both form and representation will be explored.
Initial studies of precedent from beyond the architectural milieu will culminate in
each student writing a brief Manifesto and Vows for their upcoming project
following the Dogme 95 structure (which reportedly took 30 minutes to author).

Religious holy days sometimes conflict with class and examination schedules. If
you miss an examination, work assignment, or other project due to the
observance of a religious holy day you will be given the opportunity to complete
the work missed within a reasonable time after the absence. You must notify
each of your instructors as far in advance as possible prior to the classes
scheduled on dates you will be absent to observe a religious holy day.
Disabilities
Students with disabilities who require special accommodation should obtain a
letter documenting the disability from the Services for Students with Disabilities
area of the Office of the Dean of Students (471-6259 or 471-4641 TTY). Present
this letter to the instructor in each course at the beginning of the semester and
accommodations needed will be discussed at that time. Please remind the
instructor of any testing accommodations required five days prior to upcoming
exams
Security, safety and the studio
The studio is an exceptional learning environment. Since it is a place for all, it
necessitates the careful attention to the needs of everyone. Please see your
instructor if there are problems that you are unable to resolve on your own. All
spraying of fixative, spray paint or any other substance should be done in the
shop. Security is a necessary component for a studio that is accessible to you
and your colleagues 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Please be mindful not to
admit any uninvited visitors.
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the
Behavior Concerns Advice Line to discuss by phone your concerns about
another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a partnership
among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health
