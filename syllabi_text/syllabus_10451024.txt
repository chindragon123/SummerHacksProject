Bienvenue!
Welcome to French 611C hybrid, the second-semester French course offered at the University of Texas. This course offers the
best of both worlds, by combining the new and up to date Français interactif online content delivered via Canvas with two face to
face sessions per week during which time you are interacting in French with your classmates, your instructor, and the course
materials. All of the course materials you need are embedded within Canvas. There is no book for this course.
In addition to working independently through the online activities in Canvas, we will also be meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays
all semester, either in Zoom or on campus. You should expect a substantial amount of work and preparation outside of class,
similar to what you experienced in FR 601C, but with an additional 3 hours (minimum) to account for the removal of three in-class
sessions per week. For summer, this will be even more intense since we have to cover the same amount of content in less time.
You are expected to come to class prepared and ready to engage in interactive activities. This course follows the dates of the
regular University of Texas semester.
In FR 611C, we use our first-year French curriculum, Français interactif, a unique beginning French program developed at the
University of Texas. Français interactif helps you explore the French language and culture by following the lives of real UT
students who participated in the UT Summer Program in Lyon, France. The UT students will introduce you to their French host
families, their French university, and their lives in France.
In addition to following the exploits of these UT students, you will also watch videos of native French speakers as well as scenes of
day-to-day interactions (e.g., vendors in the market, waiters at a café, children getting ready to go to school, etc.) These video-
based materials give Français interactif an authenticity and immediacy lacking in most commercially produced textbooks.
Authentic materials from many other sources have also been incorporated into this hybrid course.
The goal of this course is to continue to develop your listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in French. You will learn useful
vocabulary, grammatical structures, and cultural information, all naturally embedded in the videos and online activities.
Prerequisite
FR 601C (or equivalent) with grade of C or above.
If you opted to take FR 601C pass/fail in Spring 2020 and did not receive a C or higher, you will likely struggle in FR 611C. If at any
time you feel you are not understanding the content, reach out to your instructor for help right away. Be aware of the drop dates
and know your options.
Attendance and Preparation
Daily preparation, regular attendance, and active in-class participation are essential to your success in learning French. This
includes being ON TIME for class. In between our "Seances", you will need to spend a great deal of time going through each
assigned lesson.
For this 6 hours class, we are only in class together for 3 hours per week (fall/spring semester), so you are expected to participate
in all class sessions. Participation grades are recorded for each face to face session. When you are not present, you will receive a
zero. Your instructor will explain how you will be self-assessing your in-class participation in the "Note de participation".
For students with special needs presenting documentation at the beginning of the semester from the SSD, approved provisions
and accommodations will be made. Be sure to schedule an appointment to discuss your needs with your instructor early on to
avoid any misunderstandings. Also, please keep in mind that accommodations are not retroactive, so it is important to present
proper documentation as soon as it is available.
Canvas Assignments
Regular and persistent preparation, as well as active participation in class, are essential to your success in learning French. While
many of the at-home asynchronous activities do not count towards your grade, you are expected to work through them
thoughtfully, paying close attention to the details. You will need to spend a great deal of time studying and repeating the
vocabulary to help you learn and internalize it. The Tex's French Grammar is meant to be read thoroughly before you move on to
the activities. Bref, you cannot rush through the lessons just to get them done, and expect to learn French successfully.
Any activity that is not auto-corrected in Canvas and needs to be graded by the instructor, will count as a homework grade. With
each submission, you will be able to see your answers and the correct answers. When you submit paragraphs, audio and video
recordings, and certain other types of “open-ended” responses, your instructor must grade these individually, so the feedback will
not be instantaneous.


Keep track of all assignment due dates indicated on the course syllabus. Once a due date and time passes (always 11:59 pm), the
online activities remain open, but will be automatically marked LATE by Canvas. No late submissions will be allowed. You will
receive a zero for all late submissions. You must submit all activities in sequential order to be allowed to progress through the
course.
The next set of activities in Canvas will open after each in-class session or "Séance". So after each Séance, the lessons leading up
to the subsequent Séance will go live. As I mentioned above, you must work through the materials progressively as they appear. In
other words, you cannot move on to Leçon 5 until you have completed Leçon 4, and so on. The course has been set up so that
Canvas will block you from doing this, or from skipping over activities.

circumstances.
Technical Requirements
•      Reliable internet connection
•      A computer or tablet with microphone and webcam (always do a sound check before and after submitting your recorded
       activities)
•      Canvas is designed to be compatible with Google Chrome, so if you are using a web browser other than Chrome, you might
       not have full functionality in Canvas, and Canvas will act very glitchy. Bottom line, use Chrome as your browser for Canvas.
•      Canvas Student Guides and Video Guides
•      Accents (how to make accented characters on your keyboard)
Recommended Resources
•      wordreference.com (free online dictionary)
•      Canvas Student app available for download on Android and iOS devices
Canvas and Tech Problems
If you ever have a problem with a Canvas assignment, such as an answer that you know is correct, and Canvas is showing that it is
not, please email your instructor immediately so it can be fixed. For all technical issues, first, make sure you are using Google
Chrome. If you are and the problem persists, contact Canvas Support. You can access this 24/7/365 support through the HELP
menu in the lower-left corner of the orange Canvas interface:
If your personal computer is having issues (camera or mic not working, videos not uploading, etc.), it is your responsibility to
borrow a computer to complete your assignments or to have your tech issues addressed by a professional immediately. This will
not be a valid excuse to not complete an assignment, so it is a good idea to not wait until the last minute to complete assignments,
particularly when submitting media files.
Additional Information
Lower-Division French. For additional information on lower-division French courses, please contact Dr. Nancy Guilloteau, Lower-
Division French Coordinator, at nguilloteauut@gmail.com.
Academic Integrity. Academic dishonesty on any graded assignment will result in a zero. Academic dishonesty includes any kind
of cheating. In language classes, this includes the use of online translators. Be aware that such behavior can have far-reaching
consequences, and can result in suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information,
visit http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/scholdis.php
In order to receive full credit on assignments in FR 611C, you are expected to use only the vocabulary and structures that have
been learned in 601C and this course to date. Producing perfect, native-like paragraphs and other work with the aid of
unauthorized technological or personal assistance will result in a grade of zero. Use of Google translate or other aids is considered
scholastic dishonesty and will result in a zero and possible further action.


Special Needs. The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259 or 471-4641, or go
to http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd
For students with special needs presenting documentation at the beginning of the semester from the SSD, provisions and
accommodations will be made. Please keep in mind that accommodations are not retroactive, so it is important to present proper
documentation as soon as it is available.
Code of conduct. The dean may initiate disciplinary proceedings under subchapter 11-300 against a student who conducts
himself or herself in a manner that impedes, interferes with, or disrupts any University teaching, research, administrative,
disciplinary, public service, learning, or other authorized activity. For more information and a complete list of Student Standards of
Conduct, please consult http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi08-09/app/gi08.appc03.html#subchapter-11-300-initiation-of-
disciplinary-proceedings.
All students are expected to assist in maintaining a classroom environment that is conducive to learning. Inappropriate behavior
(frequent tardiness, offensive or insensitive remarks, talking out of turn, sleeping, overt inattentiveness, harassment or bullying of the
instructor or other students, etc.) shall result, minimally, in a recorded absence and/or a request to leave class. Repeated
inappropriate or disruptive behavior will be reported to the Dean of Students and can very quickly escalate into a judicial matter.
