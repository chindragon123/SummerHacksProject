I. Course Description:
Generally speaking, this course is an introduction to the musical, social, cultural, and political elements of Hip Hop
culture in the US, as interpreted through the development of its musical style.
II. Course Aims and Objectives:
Aims
Beyond increasing familiarity with African American music and culture, a major goal of this course is to provide
you with the tools to coexist--and indeed thrive--in a global context.
Specific Learning Objectives:
By the end of this course, students will:
          ● Be able to recognize and describe general elements of African American cultural practices, including
              instruments/media, performance practice, and aesthetics.
          ●   Discuss the ways in which these elements have influenced (and continue to influence) contemporary
              American society, especially with respect to hip hop and related genres.
          ●   Critically assess expressions and representations of African American culture in music and media.


          ●    Be able to apply these critical thinking skills in the context of other cultures, both historical and
               contemporary.
III. Format and Procedures:
This course will blend lecture and discussions. These content will center around a select body of readings,
recordings, videos, and other media. Advance preparation is key to avoiding a “dry lecture” format, so please come
to class prepared to discuss that day’s materials. As there is no TA for this course, I will be your primary contact for
all your questions or comments. Other activities include: quizzes & assignments, and a final project to be explained
in class.
IV. My Assumptions
I believe that diversity is good for the world. It opens up our eyes to other perspectives and possibilities, and can
thus help move humankind forward. I also believe that the understanding of how identity works in general is key to
understanding ourselves. While this course will focus primarily upon expressions of African American identity, I
hope that we will foster greater patience, understanding, and respect for any and all peoples.
By enrolling in this class, I assume that you are interested in taking such a journey. (By the way, the answer to
question #5 on the syllabus quiz is C.) While I don’t expect you to agree with everything you hear, I do expect that
you will put the utmost effort towards developing an appreciation for the musics and cultures discussed, as well as
an awareness of music’s important role in the enrichment of the human spirit.
This class is NOT intended for just music majors. No previous musical knowledge or experience is required to excel
in this course. Keep in mind that listeners make up the largest (and arguably the most powerful) demographic of the
music industry, so what you think and feel about the music is important. Music is all around you, and—however
unknowingly—you have developed the tools to interpret, discuss, and critique it. This class is intended to hone those
skills, augmenting them with information about the music’s technical and cultural contexts.
A Word About Language
Many of the recordings that we will encounter will utilize “colorful” language of various types. Whenever
practicable, I have substituted edited versions of the examples if the edits do not dramatically affect the intention,
meaning, or aesthetic of the song. However, some examples need to be heard in their original format. Consider this
your fair warning. The inclusion of such examples is not intended to be offensive, merely to represent the realities of
the musical soundscapes we encounter daily.
V. Course Requirements:
          1. Class attendance and participation policy:
                   a.   Attendance will be taken periodically. At the end of the semester, you will receive a
                        percentage based on the number of absences you have accrued. For example, if we take
                        attendance 20 times, and you are absent 10 of those times, you will receive a 50% for that
                        “assignment” at the end of the semester.
                   b.   Unexcused absences are any absence for which you do not have a valid, verifiable excuse
                        (university excuse, doctor’s note, funeral program, letter from a judge, etc.). Undocumented
                        illnesses will be considered unexcused.
                   c.   Any absences or late arrivals/departures should be discussed with me well beforehand, so we
                        can make the appropriate arrangements.
                   d.   YOU are responsible for any content that you miss due to absence, including readings,
                        quizzes, or in-class activities.
                   e.   Late assignments will not be accepted, except in the case of EXCUSED absences.


       f.   Please come on time, and be prepared to stay for the duration of class. Students who have
            issues getting to or from class in a timely manner should speak with me immediately, and will
            be handled on case-by-case basis.
       g.   A Word about Conduct in the Classroom: This course will deal with some touchy issues,
            including race/ethnicity, class, and gender/sexuality issues. While I want you to feel
            comfortable to express your thoughts, feelings, and opinions, I ask that please be sensitive to
            those around you--we all come from a variety of backgrounds and belief systems (which is
            critical to the learning experience). Students who refuse to be respectful will be asked to
            leave.
       h.   At the same time, however, I encourage you to challenge yourself and your assumptions about
            the world by embracing ideas that may be new or unfamiliar to you. This classroom is a safe
            environment with learning as our primary goal--let’s take advantage of that.
       i.   If, at any time, you are made to feel uncomfortable, please do not hesitate to bring this to my
            attention after class. I am sure we can work through it.
       Religious Holy Days
       By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to
       the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work
       assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to
       complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
2. Discussion Sections:
         Attendance at discussion sections is mandatory. These sections are designed to
         allow students to engage with the material in a more individualized fashion. You
         will receive a grade for attendance/participation at these meetings, as well as any
         assignments that may be needed.
3. Course Readings/Materials:
    ○ Assorted readings, provided by the instructor and available online.
    ○ Recordings, provided by the instructor and available online.
    ○ CANVAS course site access (see technology policy)
4. Assignments, Assessment, and Evaluation
       a.   Throughout this course, you will be expected to read and listen regularly. This is not only part
            of your preparation for this course, but also a part of your musical and intellectual
            development in general. Dates for readings/listenings on the syllabus are to be completed BY
            that date. Please come to class prepared to discuss the material assigned for that day, and
            submit all assignments online in a timely manner.
       b.   The bulk of the coursework will consist of (online) quizzes, reading guides, assignments, and
            a one-time “DECODING” final project, which will be explained in class.
       c.   No late assignments will be accepted.
       d.   There will be NO Midterm Exam.
       e.   NO FINAL EXAM for this class. Instead, you will complete a final project, which is due by
            the university scheduled final exam time. This will be submitted online, per the instructions I
            will give in class.
       f.   Make-up quizzes will not be given. Should you fall too far behind, see me. Each quiz will be
            available online for AT LEAST two days, so you should plan to be able to complete them
            before the due date.


          5. Technology Policies
                 a.   This class uses CANVAS (https://canvas.utexas.edu). If you are not familiar with it, please
                      take some time NOW to get used to navigating the interface. 99% of course materials,
                      announcements, etc. will be circulated via this courseware.
                 b.   This class has a twitter feed (@UT_Doc_C), which I will use to inform you about concerts,
                      events, or updates in real time. While following me is not a requirement, you will want to
                      check the twitter feed periodically. For those of you who do not use Twitter, I have embedded
                      a Twitter feed widget on the main page of Canvas. Since this account is purely for educational
                      purposes, I will not follow you back—nothing personal.
                 c.   In this “always connected” world we are used to being accessible anywhere, anytime.
                      Consider this classroom a “sacred space” for us—a place where we can unplug for an hour
                      and just listen and talk. Don’t ruin that space by bringing in the outside world! Please silence
                      or turn off cell phones before class, and refrain from using them for the duration. If something
                      is pressing, please excuse yourself (quietly) and use the phone somewhere else. However, it
                      will be your responsibility to catch up on any material missed, so ask a friend to take notes for
                      you.
                 d.   Please remove your earbuds before coming to class. Duh.
                 e.   While I encourage students to utilize technology in the classroom, I do have a “front row”
                      laptop policy. Any person who wishes to use their computer for note-taking, must sit in the
                      front two rows--no exceptions. Since front row seating is limited, you are encouraged to
                      arrive early! PLEASE…save Facebook for elsewhere. Are you really paying good money to
                      Facebook?!?
                 f.   It is the responsibility of the student to make sure they complete and submit all online
                      assignments correctly. I STRONGLY suggest that you utilize on-campus labs if you are not
                      100% confident in the hardware, software, or internet connection you are using. Bad
                      connections, power outages, frozen computers, etc. are NOT grounds for a make-up.
                 g.   Last thing: the STUDENT is responsible for their own technology. You wouldn’t ask your
                      dentist to fix your toilet, so don’t ask your music professor to fix your computer. IT Helpdesk
                      offers substantial support for Canvas, email, connectivity, software, and hardware. They can
                      be reached at 475-9400.
VI. Grading Procedures: Grades will be based on:
                 15%        = Attendance & Participation
                 15%        = Reading Guides
                 40%        = Assignments (Quizzes, Discussion Forums, etc.)
                 30%        = Final DECODED Project
Letter grades are computed as follows: 90%=A, 80%=B, 70%=C, 60%=D, and so forth. All pluses and minuses
are computed at x3% and x7% (for example, 80%=B-, 83%=B, 87%=B+. The university does not give A+ grades,
but you know in your hearts if you are an A+ person.


VII. Academic Integrity
University of Texas Honor Code
The core values of The University of Texas at Austin are learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual
opportunity, and responsibility. Each member of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity,
honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community.
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code. [See the UT
Honor Code above.] Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the
student's own work.
VIII. Other University Notices and Policies
Course Flags
This course carries the flag for Cultural Diversity in the United States. Cultural Diversity courses are
designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural experience.
You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the
practices, beliefs, and histories of at least one U.S. cultural group that has experienced persistent
marginalization.
Email and Communication Policy
Email is the primary mode of communication for this course. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that
his/her email settings are such that they can receive official email from the university, and more specifically, through
BlackBoard. Please allow a 24 hour turnaround for all emails to the professor. After 48 hours, however, feel free to
send it again—it has gotten buried. Of course, I will attempt to answer messages as soon as possible, but last-minute
or odd-hour emails will have to wait. In case of an emergency: email me immediately to apprise me of the situation,
and then relax—we will work something out. You are always welcome during my posted office hours (please
knock), or you can make an appointment.
Documented Disability Statement
Any student with a documented disability who requires academic accommodations should contact Services for
Students with Disabilities (SSD) at (512) 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone). Faculty are not
required to provide accommodations without an official accommodation letter from SSD.
     ■   Please notify me as quickly as possible if the material being presented in class is not accessible (e.g.,
         instructional videos need captioning, course packets are not readable for proper alternative text conversion,
         etc.).
     ■   Contact Services for Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329-3986 (video phone) or
         reference SSD’s website for more disability-related information:
         http://www.utexas.edu/diversity/ddce/ssd/for_cstudents.php
Behavior Concerns Advice Line (BCAL)
If you are worried about someone who is acting differently, you may use the Behavior Concerns Advice Line to
discuss by phone your concerns about another individual’s behavior. This service is provided through a partnership
among the Office of the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), the Employee
Assistance Program (EAP), and The University of Texas Police Department (UTPD). Call 512-232-5050 or visit
http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal.


Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic reasons to six (6). As
stated in Senate Bill 1231:
          “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education may not permit an
   undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses, including any course a transfer student has
   dropped at another institution of higher education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than
   that number.”
