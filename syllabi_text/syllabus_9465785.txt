Description
         This multi-disciplinary course covers over two decades of work produced by and
about black lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people both within and beyond the
borders of the United States. While introducing various artists and intellectuals of the
black queer diaspora, this seminar explores what it might mean to think of artistry (film,
fiction, photography, painting, poetry) as a form of theorizing. We will spend time with
black queer subjects in the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. Our aim is to use
artistry to highlight the dynamic relationship between Black Diaspora Studies and Queer
Studies.
*Please Note:
1) This course carries flags for Cultural Diversity in the United States and Global Cultures.
2) This course deals with aspects of gender and sexuality in a candid and explicit manner at
times. Students who do not feel comfortable with this approach should not take the course. If you
choose to take this course, you have agreed to respect our classroom as a safe space. Racism,
sexism, homophobia, transphobia or xenophobia of any sort will not be tolerated.
Requirements & Assignments
1. Attendance: Each student is required to attend every class session. Unexcused
absences are unacceptable. More than one unexcused absence during the term will result
in a reduction of the overall course grade for each session missed (AàA-, B+àB, etc.).
*Note: The use of laptops and mobile phones is NOT permitted in the classroom
 2. Informed participation: Each student will complete the assigned readings and bring
hardcopies of these readings to class. Students will come to class on time and prepared
with questions and comments on each reading.
3. Films: As part of the course, the viewing of films is required. Most of these films are
on reserve at the Library.

4. Reading responses: Each week, students will post a reading response on Canvas by
Monday at 11:59pm. These posts are intended to provoke conversation. The week’s
assigned readings must be addressed directly, but no need to summarize. Critique,
compare, and pose questions for discussion or clarification. Each post must comment on
at least one other person’s reading response. The first reading response is due on
Monday 2/4 at 11:59pm. These responses will be graded on a credit/no credit basis.
Students will receive no credit for late posts.
5. Discussion facilitation: Each student will be assigned two class sessions to lead as a
facilitator (groups of two or more students may be necessary). Facilitators are required to
meet with the instructor during office hours prior to each facilitation. Facilitators are
expected to draft questions for discussion based on the assigned readings and are required
to read all reading responses posted for that week. The inclusion of course-relevant
audio/visual material as a way to encourage conversation is highly encouraged. Students
will receive a grade for these facilitations. Discussion facilitators are NOT required to
write reading responses for the week of their facilitation.
6. Final project proposal: Students will form groups and each group will write a 2-3-
page proposal (12pt. Times New Roman font, double spaced) for a final project. This
proposal will explain the form of the final project and the texts the group will be using.
These texts must include course related readings/films, but may also include outside
resources. This proposal will be accompanied by a briefly annotated bibliography (the
bibliography does NOT count toward the minimum page limit). Each group member will
receive the same grade.
7. Final project: Each group will complete a final project to be accompanied by a 5-7
page explanatory essay (12pt. Times New Roman font, double spaced). The project will
be due on the first day of Final Exams). Each group members will receive the same
grade.
   •   For the Final Project students will produce a creative work in the medium of their
       choice (performance, film, painting, sculpture, photography, literary text, web, etc.
       or using multiple media). This work MUST engage directly with texts/films
       assigned for the course and themes raised by the course. Outside sources are
       encouraged but not required.
Please note for all assignments:
* Late proposals and projects will be penalized for every day they are late (i.e. A à A-
if one day late, A à B+ if two days late, etc.). Students are required to proofread their
material prior to submission (ideally, someone else will also read the material for
grammatical/spelling/flow errors your eyes might miss). Materials that show evidence of
                                               2

Grading Schema
(Informed by “Grading Standards II” by Maxine Rodburg)
The following are the standards I adhere to when I grade essays/projects. Pluses and
minuses represent shades of difference, as do split grades (e.g. B-/C+). I assign grades on
the evidence of the work submitted, not on effort or time spent.

    African & African Diaspora Studies                              University of Texas at Austin
A:     An excellent essay/project (this is not the same as perfect). This is an ambitious,
       perceptive essay/project that grapples with interesting, complex ideas, responds
       discerningly to counter-arguments, and explores well-chosen evidence
       revealingly. The work enhances— rather than underscores— the reader’s and
       writer’s knowledge (it doesn’t simply repeat what has been discussed in class).
       There is a context for all the ideas; someone outside the class would be enriched,
       not confused, by reading the essay or encountering the project. Its beginning
       opens up— rather than flatly announces— its thesis. Its end is something more
       than a summary. The language is clean, precise, and often elegant. As a
       reader/witness I feel surprised, delighted, changed. There’s something new here
       for me, something only the specific group could have offered and explored in this
       particular way. The group’s stake in the material is obvious.
B:     This is an essay/project that reaches high and achieves many of its aims. The
       ideas are solid and progressively explored but some thin patches require more
       analysis and/or some stray thoughts or elements do not quite fit together well. The
       language is generally clear and precise but occasionally not. The evidence is
       relevant, but there may be too little. The context for the evidence may not be
       sufficiently explored, so that I have to make some of the connections that the
       writer should have made clear for me.
       OR This is an essay/project that does not reach as high as an ‘A’ essay, but
       thoroughly achieves its aims. This is a solid essay/project whose reasoning and
       argument may nonetheless be rather routine— in this case the limitation is
       conceptual.
C:     This is an essay/project that has real problems in one of these areas: 1) conception
       (there is at least one main idea but it is obscure and hard to get to); 2) structure
       (the logic behind the ordering of the materials is far from clear); 3) use of
       evidence (there is no evidence presented or that which is provided is weak and/or
       the connections among the ideas are unclear or without context; the text/project is
       plagued by generalizations and absent substantial proof); 4) language (the
       articulation is awkward and generally stands in the way of comprehension).
       Overall, the essay/project may be repetitive, poorly organized, and/or superficial
       in its treatment of the subject matter. In addition, punctuation, spelling, grammar,
       citations, and transitions may be problems as well.
       OR This is an essay/project that largely summarizes any given text or other work
       (of art or analysis), but is undertaken without too many major problems.
       OR This is an essay/project that is chiefly a personal reaction to something. This
       is perhaps well written/executed, but there is scant engagement with course
       content or other scholarly material; it is mostly opinion.
D:   This is an essay/project that demonstrates very little effort to grapple seriously with
the    ideas it hopes to explore.

   African & African Diaspora Studies                              University of Texas at Austin
      OR This is writing/a project that is extremely problematic in many of the areas
      mentioned above: conception, structure, use of evidence, language, etc.
      OR This is writing/a project that does not come close to meeting the expectations
      of the assignment.
F:    This is an essay/project that should most definitely be re-conceptualized and
      revised drastically so that it can be re-submitted if that option is available.
