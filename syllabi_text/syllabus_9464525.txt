This course intensively examines U.S. women's history from the end of World War II to the 1970s, while also
exploring understandings of womanhood, manhood and sexuality that became central to cultural politics and social
conflicts in the postwar period. By weaving together women’s history, popular culture, and social movements, and
by doing deeper research on women’s activism at the University of Texas at Austin, we raise fresh questions about
well-known episodes of U.S. history. Why, for example, do most Americans remember Rosa Parks only as a demure
seamstress who initiated the Montgomery Bus Boycott because she was too tired to give up her seat to a white
person? If every young woman aspired to be a
suburban housewife in the fifties, then where did
the sixties movements come from? We also
explore how various groups—working-class
women, feminists, civil rights activists,
immigrants, suburban girls, and others—
differently negotiated family, work and
sexuality. We examine roots of current issues,
such as reproduction, sexuality, job equity,
welfare, race, and ethnicity.
This spring, the class will contribute to the
AUSTIN WOMEN ACTIVISTS ORAL
HISTORY PROJECT, a collection at the
Briscoe Library comprised of oral histories by
students who have taken this course. Students
working on their own or in pairs will be assigned
to a woman who was an activist here in the 1960s Demonstration at UT. Judy Smith, right. Photo by Alan Pogue
or 1970s. This interview will form the basis of class projects. This history has notphoto
                                                                                      been written and will be important
to the community. To begin thinking about women and historical memory, students write a paper on Beat Women.
GOALS FOR STUDENTS:
     Ø Develop a much deeper understanding of women’s history from the 1940s to 1970s that would be
         possible in a women’s history lecture course, including matters of race, gender, sexuality, and class.
     Ø Learn more about activism at UT in the key period of the 1960s-1970s.
     Ø Gain experience in working out your own original argument about the history you are studying
         Understand how material in this class may challenge accepted broad narratives of relevant historical
         subjects.
     Ø Gain experience conducting research as postwar US historians do, with original documents and oral
         histories.
     Ø Learn how to conduct a professional quality interview, suitable for use by other researchers.
     Ø Learn how to connect with community members in relation to your research.
     Ø Learn how to work closely with archives staff to contribute to a permanent archival collection.
     Ø Develop writing, research, and analytical skills translatable for jobs after graduation.
     Ø Learn how to use media to present your research in a clear, succinct, and powerful way.
This is a discussion seminar, but includes short lectures, films, workshops and audio/visual projects. Attendance is
crucial: see policy below for unexcused absences. Students come to the course with varying backgrounds; some
are history majors while others are taking their first history class in a few years. I take that into account in
assignments and grading. But regardless of your background, I urge you to get involved, speak up, and ask


questions! If talking in class is hard for you, please come see me. And PLEASE let me know if you are unsure of
our direction or any specific project, or are having problems keeping up!!
NAMES AND GENDER IDENTITIES: If you prefer a name or pronoun not on the roster, let me know asap.
REQUIRED READINGS                    SHORT READINGS are available on Canvas.

PLAN AHEAD SO YOU DO NOT MISS CLASS THE WEEK BEFORE SPRING BREAK. WE WILL HAVE
IMPORTANT WORK TO DO ON PROJECTS THAT WEEK.
ATTENDANCE: To be clear, this course requires you in class with reading and/or other assignments completed,
ready to participate, and not arriving late or leaving early. You are permitted 3 unexcused absences, but after that
you lose 2 points for each additional one. Excused absences cover documented medical and mental health problems,
personal or family emergencies, official university responsibilities, and religious holidays. At my discretion,
multiple late arrivals and/or early departures may result in an additional unexcused absence. If you have a regular
problem, let me know. If you miss over 2 consecutive class days, please discuss with me as soon as possible.
TECHNOLOGY IN THE CLASSROOM: No phones may be out in class and sound should be turned off. You
may use a laptop to take notes or conduct other classwork, but you lose that privilege if you use it for other
activities. Really.
ASSIGNMENTS
250-Word Biweekly Reading Responses on assigned readings for next class.
DUE 5 P.M. THE EVENING BEFORE CLASS, typed, double-spaced, and uploaded on Canvas. Each of you will
write 5 of these. You’ll be divided into Group A and Group B. They’re meant to provide the basis for a lively,
thoughtful discussion. I’m looking for insights into central issues addressed by the readings, including what they
mean to you, positively or negatively (or both). Sometimes I’ll ask you to compare and contrast 2 readings.


AVOID: TANGENTS ABOUT TODAY, SUMMARIES INSTEAD OF COMMENTARIES, AND BIG
GENERALIZATIONS NOT REALLY ROOTED IN THESE READINGS. You may use an informal style, but
check for spelling and grammar.
Paper on Women and the Beat Movement (1,000-1,500 words):
This takes place over 3 class periods, due the 4th period. In the first, we’ll discuss Joyce Johnson’ memoir, Minor
Characters. In the second, we’ll see documents and other materials from or about women Beat artists. In the 3rd,
you’ll submit a document analysis and have time to work on your papers based on the memoir, documents, and
other readings I make available.
Austin Women Activists Oral History Project
Your interview will become the basis for several other assignments. I won’t be grading the actual interview, but
the strength of the interview will help all the other aspects of this project. Elements include
     1) CONDUCTING THE ORAL HISTORY WITH PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS
     2) SHORT ASSIGNMENTS SUCH AS A 2-3-PAGE TRANSCRIPTION, ANALYZING HISTORICAL
         DOCUMENTS, ETC.
     3) PECHAKUCHA PROJECT WITH A PARTNER, BASED ON ORAL HISTORIES, AND OTHER
         READINGS AND DOCUMENTS MAKE AVAILABLE TO YOU.
     4) PAPER ON YOUR EXPERIENCE, YOUR ‘PROBLEMATIC,’ AND OTHE ASPECTS OF PROJECT.
     5) GROUP PRESENTATION – THIS MAY INVOLVE WOMEN YOU INTERVIEWED.
COMMUNICATION
CANVAS WILL BE USED for announcements, assignment details, grading rubrics, readings, tips on note-taking,
exams, and writing, and more. Most material will be on PAGES. On the home page, click on PAGES. Then,
VIEW ALL PAGES. You can then choose the one you are looking for. If you use FILES, you may not find the
most recent version.
EMAIL VS. CANVAS: For a timely response, email me at lbgreen@austin.utexas.edu, not Canvas, even if I send
a message to the whole class. I check email a few times a day, but Canvas much less often.
USE A PROFESSIONAL FORM OF ADDRESS IN EMAILS: Prof. Green, Dr. Green, or some equivalent. I’ve
received too many emails addressed: “Hey”!
I may not see emails sent outside of regular business hours until the next day.
