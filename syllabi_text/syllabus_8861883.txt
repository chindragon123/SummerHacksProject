Fall 2018 – E314V / AFR 317F
African American Literature and Culture
Instructor: Adena Rivera-Dundas
Unique number: 35150
Flags: Cultural Diversity, Writing
Class Time and Place: TTH 3:30 pm-5:00 pm PAR 210
Course Website: https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1230276
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course will engage with the rich literary tradition of black female writers, starting with the
rise of black feminism in the 1980s and ending with the contemporary moment. As a class, we
will read long- and short-form fiction, experimental prose, essays, and poetry in order to
investigate ways in which literary form informs, challenges, or is shaped by intersectionality and
anti-racist politics. This class will ask students to consider the relationship between race,
gender, and literature, and ask what writing and reading can do in the face of sexist and racist
systems.
The primary aim of this course is to help students develop and improve the critical reading,
writing, and thinking skills needed for success in upper-division courses in English and other
disciplines. They will also gain practice in using the Oxford English Dictionary and other online
research tools and print resources that support studies in the humanities. Students will learn
basic information literacy skills and models for approaching literature with various historical,
generic, and cultural contexts in mind.
This course contains a writing flag. The writing assignments in this course are arranged
procedurally with a focus on invention, development through instructor and peer feedback, and
revision; they will comprise a major part of the final grade.
REQUIRED TEXTS:
Morrison, Toni. Beloved. 1988
Butler, Octavia. Dawn. 1987
Rankine, Claudia. Citizen: An American Lyric. 2014
COURSE GOALS:
In this course, students can expect to:


 E314 V/AFR 317F Fall 2018                                                                         2
• Research topics in African American literature and culture, using a range of UT library
        databases and print sources.
• Explore a wide range of formal and informal strategies for interpreting literary texts. Students
        will close read texts to construct thoughtful analyses (supported by textual and
        contextual evidence).
• Become familiar with the challenges (both practical and ethical) involved in researching and
        writing about historically marginalized and underrepresented groups.
• Produce college-level writing through outlines, reading responses, peer review, self-
        evaluation, and revision.
COURSE FLAGS:
This course carries both a Cultural Diversity in the U.S. flag and a Writing flag.
Cultural Diversity courses are designed to increase your familiarity with the variety and
richness of the American cultural experience. You should therefore expect a substantial portion
of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least
one U.S. cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalization.
Writing courses are designed to give students experience with writing in an academic
discipline. In this class, you can expect to write regularly during the semester, complete
substantial writing projects, and receive feedback from your instructor to help you improve your
writing. You will also have the opportunity to revise assignments, and you will be asked to read
and discuss your peers’ work. You should expect a substantial portion of your grade to come
from your written work.

be inclusive of all scores of 80.0000 through 83.9999. The University does not recognize the
grade of A+.
     •  A = 94-100             •   B = 84-86            •   C = 74-76           •   D = 64-66
     •  A- = 90-93             •   B- = 80-83           •   C- = 70-73          •   D- = 61-63
     •  B+ = 87-89             •   C+ = 77-79           •   D+ = 67-69          •   F = 0-60
Participation
Because this is a class based on the exchange of ideas, participation is necessary and
expected. Your presence, attention, preparation, and willingness to engage are required for your
success and the success of your peers. That said, all learning styles are welcome in this
classroom.
CLASS POLICIES
Late Work
Work that is submitted past its deadline will drop one letter grade for every day that it is
late. For example: an assignment due on Sunday at 1 pm will be deducted one letter grade
(ex: from an A- to a B-) if turned in before 1 pm on Monday, and two letter grades if turned in
before 10 pm on Sunday, etc.
Absences
Attendance is mandatory in this course. After four missed classes, your final grade in the course
will go down a complete letter grade for each subsequent missed day.
You will not be penalized for missing class on religious holy days. A student who misses classes
or other required activities, including peer review, for the observance of a religious holy day
should inform the instructor, in writing, at least one week before the absence, so that alternative
arrangements can be made to complete work. If you know you will have to miss class(es) for
this reason, provide your instructor with the date(s) as early as possible. Please note that the
University specifies very few other excused absences (e.g., jury duty).
If you miss a class, you are responsible for getting notes and assignments from a classmate.
Please let me know as early as possible if your access needs limit your ability to attend class
regularly. I’m happy to work with you to make sure you are still able to learn in this class.
Tardiness
Three tardinesses of 15 minutes or more will be counted as one absence. Please let me
know as early as possible if your access needs limit your ability to attend class on time. I’m
happy to work with you to make sure you are still able to learn in this class.

Email Etiquette
Consider our interactions over email professional communications which require a salutation,
message, and sign-off. I will try to respond within 24 hours, but I won’t check email between 8
pm and 10 am so plan accordingly.
Technology Policy
Because we will be using some resources on Canvas, you are welcome to bring a laptop or
tablet when the reading is digital. However, please be mindful of how distracting computer
screens are to you, to your peers, and to me. If your use of technology becomes a distraction to
your peers or to me, I will ask you to put it away and you will not receive participation credit for
the day. You may not use your phone to access the reading unless you ask me ahead of time.
Please leave your phone off for the duration of class.
Weapons Policy
With the exception of concealed handguns, no weapons may be brought into the classroom.
This applies to knives, clubs, spears, machetes, metal knuckles, explosive or incendiary
devices, and any other device designed to injure or kill people. Course participants with a
license to carry a handgun must keep it concealed and on their person at all times. If a gun or
any other weapon becomes visible, the person who sees the weapon should leave the
classroom and call 911 so that law enforcement personnel can take appropriate action and
restore an atmosphere conducive to learning.
Scholastic Honesty
Turning in work that is not your own, or any other form of scholastic dishonesty, will result in a
major course penalty, possibly failure of the course. This standard applies to all drafts and
assignments, and a report of the incident will be submitted to the Office of the Dean of Students
and filed in your permanent UT record. Under certain circumstances, the Dean of Students will
initiate proceedings to expel you from the University.
Read and understand the Statement on Scholastic Responsibility, which can be found online at
http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/rhetoric/firstyearwriting/plagiarismcollusion.php If you have
any doubts about your use of sources, ask for help before handing in the assignment.
Accessibility
Your success in this class is important to me. If there are aspects of this course that prevent
you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll
develop strategies to meet both your needs and the course requirements. Any
conversations we have about accommodations are confidential.
This class will always strive to be an inclusive space. Learning requires stretching beyond
comfort zones and feeling safe is a prerequisite for a good learning environment. As we all bring
diverse experiences to our shared classroom, it is imperative that we are all respectful toward
one another. There is zero tolerance for slurs, derogatory language, or any other form of
discrimination based on race, gender presentation, marital status, religion, disability, age, or
sexual orientation.

Everyone in our class has the right to be addressed in accordance with their personal identity. I
will ask for your preferred name and pronouns early in the semester, so your peers and I can
address you appropriately.
If you find a reading or assignment triggering in any way, or suspect that you will be triggered,
please contact me as soon as possible. I am happy to speak with you about the content of the
material in advance and/or provide you with an alternative assignment. If you are troubled by or
feel unsafe in any class discussion, please speak with me as soon as possible so that we can
work to resolve the immediate problem and prevent future issues.
