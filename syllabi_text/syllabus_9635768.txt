COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course is designed to help students develop a basic understanding of biostatistics. By the end of this
course, you will have a good working knowledge of statistical data analysis and interpretation, be able to
determine the best analysis plan for a specific scientific question or experiment, choose and carry out the
most appropriate statistical analyses, identify potential flaws with either the set-up of an experiment or
the analysis of its data, and identify ethical issues in and apply ethical reasoning to biostatistical research.
By the end of the course, you will also be familiar with conducting analyses using the statistical software R.
COURSE OBJECTIVES
The assessments in this course are designed to help students meet three course objectives:
    1) Learn the basics of data analysis, specifically the statistical methods commonly used in application to
        biological, medical and health sciences research.
    2) Learn how to interpret the findings of data analysis and report the findings in scientific language.
    3) Identify ethical issues in and apply ethical reasoning to biostatistical research.
    4) Learn how to analyze and model real-world data using the software R.
REQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS & SOFTWARE
    • Register with Squarecap ($12 per semester, $18 for 1 year, or $50 for four years) and bring a web-
        enabled device to every class: www.squarecap.com
    • Download and install the statistics software package R and the user-friendly interface RStudio
        (both are free): www.r-project.org www.rstudio.com
RECOMMENDED TEXTBOOK
Whitlock, M.C. and D. Schluter. The Analysis of Biological Data, 1st or 2nd ed., Roberts and Company
Publishers, 2014. Books can be purchased at the UT Co-op and a few copies are on reserve at the Life
Science and PMA Libraries.
COURSE EXPECTATIONS
Students are responsible for ensuring that they are prepared for class each day. Here are the daily
requirements for class:
    • Arrive on time.
    • Silence any electronic devices.
    • Bring your handouts, a scientific calculator, and a wifi-enabled device.

LECTURES AND PARTICIPATION
Attendance and participation in lectures will be tracked using Squarecap. A daily class handout will be
posted on Canvas. Students are expected to download, print and bring the handout to class (editing
electronic versions is also acceptable). A portion of each class time will be devoted to working through the
handout for the day.
To earn participation credit for a given lecture, you must be present and participate via Squarecap.
Although not graded on accuracy, answers to Squarecap questions must be logical and within a reasonable
range of the correct answer. Students who earn credit for 80% or more of lectures (not including the
first-class day or exam days) will receive all class participation points of the final course grade. Students
who earn credit for 50-79% of class meetings will receive half of the participation points.
Lecture slides will be posted on Canvas after each class. The slides are intended to help you follow along
with the material and frame your own notes. Most students do not find that the lecture slides alone are
sufficient when studying for exams, so I highly recommend taking your own detailed notes during class
and using the slides as supplementary material.
Note: Since the summer session is short, the course will be very fast paced, with new material covered
every day. It is extremely important that you keep up with the material and attend lecture. Otherwise
it will be easy to get left behind.
LABS
Weekly lab meetings are held in FAC 101B. Computers (running Windows) are available in the lab room,
but you can bring your own laptop as long as R and RStudio are both installed. During the weekly
computer labs, students will learn how to conduct data analysis in R and interpret the finding. Attendance
of the computer labs is important since all project deliverables will use R. During lab sessions, students
will be led through the analysis steps for the week’s material using an example data set and then complete
a short lab assignment that will be due by 11:59pm. It is likely you will be exposed to topics in lab before
learning them in lecture.
RESEARCH PROJECT
The final exam for this course is a poster session for the course research project. The research project is
completed individually, and students will propose an analysis question, collect their own data, turn in
preliminary descriptive analyses, and create a poster of their final results. There will be assignments
related to the course project throughout the semester. Attendance at the poster presentation is
mandatory – students who do not attend their final poster session will receive a zero for their final project
poster assignment.

REGRADE POLICY
If you think there may be an error in grading, bring it to our attention immediately. To request a regrade,
come to office hours or send an email to me or the TA including your name, the specific assignment (e.g.,
HW 3), and a concise summary of your concern. There is a one-week limit with respect to regrades on
any course assignment. If you do not submit a regrade request within one week of when the grade is
posted on Canvas, it will be regarded as final. Regrade requests made in-person to me or the TA before,
during, or after class will not be considered.
MISSED CLASS OR ASSIGNMENT POLICY
Make-up exams and labs are offered only under the following circumstances:
     •   You are away from UT as part of a UT-sponsored activity including athletics and UT-sponsored
         organizations and you have notified me by the 12th class day.
     •   The lab or exam is in conflict with a religious observance and you have notified me by the 12th
         class day.
     •   You suffer from a chronic, documented illness or an emergency that results in your missing an
         exam or lab. Under these circumstances, contact me as soon as possible to discuss a course of
         action.
If you miss an exam, project assignment, or lab for any other reason, a make-up assessment is not
guaranteed and a grade of “0” will be recorded for it. If you miss an assignment for any other reason (ie.
unexpected illness not documented, car wreck) you have 24 hours to contact me and discuss your course
of action. Late homework assignments will be accepted at my discretion only if there is proper
communication. If you fail to contact the me within this time frame you will not be allowed to make up
missed assignments.
ACADEMIC HONESTY
The course is built upon the idea that team-based learning is important and a powerful way to learn. We
encourage you to study together. However, any work you turn in must be your own. Students can
work on homework assignments together, but everything turned in under your name must be from your
brain. Simply copying another student’s answers is always unacceptable.
    Students who violate the academic honesty expectations for this class will be penalized, up to receiving a
  failing grade for the class and being reported to the Office of the Dean of Students for academic dishonesty.
       These types of violations are reported to professional schools, so Don’t Cheat – it’s not worth the
                                                 consequences.
Students should be aware that project assignments will be submitted to the plagiarism-detection tool
Turnitin.com, which is intended to address plagiarism and improper citation. The software works by
cross-referencing submitted materials with an archived database of journals, essay, newspaper articles,
books, and other published work. Other methods may be used to determine the originality of the paper,
and this software is not intended to replace or substitute for my judgement regarding detection of
plagiarism.
COURE MATERIAL
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture slides, exams, labs, worksheets,
projects, and homework assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized copying of the
class materials is a violation of federal law and may result in disciplinary actions being taken against the
student. Additionally, the sharing of class materials without the specific, expressed approval of the
instructor may be a violation of the University's Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty,
which could result in further disciplinary action. This includes, among other things, uploading class
materials to websites for the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students.

NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY
In accordance with federal and state law, UT Austin prohibits unlawful discrimination, including
harassment, on the basis of race, skin color, religion, national origin, gender, gender identity, gender
expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, citizenship, and veteran status.
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
UT Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with
disabilities. Regardless of whether or not you plan to use your approved accommodations, bring me
your accommodation letter within two weeks of receiving it. For more information, contact the Office of
the Dean of Students at 471-6259.
MATHEMATICS COMPONENT
This course may be used to fulfill the mathematics component of the university core curriculum and
addresses the following three core objectives established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating
Board: communication skills, critical thinking skills, and empirical and quantitative skills.
QUANTITATIVE REASONING FLAG
This course carries the Quantitative Reasoning flag. Quantitative Reasoning courses are designed to equip
you with skills that are necessary for understanding the types of quantitative arguments you will regularly
encounter in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial portion of your
grade to come from your use of quantitative skills to analyze real-world problems.
INDEPENDENT INQUIRY FLAG
This course carries the Independent Inquiry flag. Independent Inquiry courses are designed to engage you
in the process of inquiry over the course of a semester, providing you with the opportunity for
independent investigation of a question, problem, or project related to your major. You should therefore
expect a substantial portion of your grade to come from the independent investigation and presentation of
your own work.
ETHICS FLAG
This course carries the Ethics flag. Ethics courses are designed to equip you with skills that are necessary
for making ethical decisions in your adult and professional life. You should therefore expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from assignments involving ethical issues and the process of applying
ethical reasoning to real-life situations.
EMERGENCY EVACUATION
Occupants of buildings on the UT campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated.
Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that
the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building. Students requiring
assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class. In the event
of an evacuation, follow the instruction of the instructor and TA. Do not re-enter a building unless given
instructions by the Austin Fire Department, the UT Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
