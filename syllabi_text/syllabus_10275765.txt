"This course may be used to fulfill three hours of the U.S. history component of the university core
curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by the Texas Higher Education
Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking skills, personal responsibility, and social
responsibility."
COURSE DESCRIPTION
Assessments of the historic experience of African Americans from the Civil War and
Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Era and the Second Reconstruction, i.e., the post-Civil
Rights Era from the 1970s through 2017, provide the focus of this course. Emphasis will be
placed on the political, economic, including the business activities, as well as social and
cultural activities of African Americans. The course begins with assessing the Black American
experience during the Civil War and Reconstruction.                      In the immediate first post-
Reconstruction, the Exodus of 1879 is considered along with the founding and building of
Black Towns. Also, significant Supreme Court decisions, and extralegal means, including
violence, which led to the disfranchisement and segregation of Blacks, that is, the rise of Jim
Crow, at the turn of the century are discussed. The Great Migration of the WWI era is
examined and the ideologies of black leaders during that period (1900-1930), W.E.B. Du Bois,
Booker T. Washington, Ida B. Wells and Marcus Garvey are compared. Particularly, the
establishment of black businesses is examined and compared with white corporate America
during the turn of the early twentieth century Industrial Revolution.
The rise of the black urban ghetto and impact of the African American working class as it
relates to African American culture provide the focus for examining the twentieth century
Black Experience. The Harlem Renaissance, the conditions of blacks in the Great Depression,
their military participation in WWII, Ralph Bunche’s United Nation’s contribution, the Korean
Conflict and the 1954 Brown decision provide an introduction to the Black Freedom Movement
of the 1960s, including subsequent black military participation in Vietnam and Afghanistan.
Assessments are made of the riots in the 1960s, Los Angeles 1992, Ferguson 2014, Charlotte,
2016; ideologies of Black leaders, Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael,
Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker, Angela Davis, Kathleen Cleaver, black organizations, NAACP,
Urban League CORE, SNCC, Black Panthers, black fraternities/sororities. Agendas of post-Civil
rights era black leaders Jesse Jackson, Minister Louis Farrakhan, Rev. Al Sharpton and black
business leaders, Bob Johnson (BET), Oprah Winfrey, Houston-based Case Lawal. The post-
Civil Rights era rise of national black political leaders is examined: US Senators, Edward
Brooke, Carol Moseley-Braun and Congresswomen Shirley Chisholm, Barbara Jordan, Sheila
Jackson-Lee and presidential appointees: Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown, Secretary of
State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice and Attorney General Eric Holder appointed under
                                                      1


President Barack Hussein Obama the first African American president of the United States,
elected in 2008 and served to January 2017. Also, two African Americans have been
appointed Supreme Court Justices: Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice Clarence Thomas.
Yet, who are the rising new black political leaders such as New Jersey United States Senator
Cory Booker? Still, of all racial/ethnic groups in the US, African American incomes are at the
bottom and black business profits are less than 1% of total USA business profits.
The course ends with commentaries on the retrenchment in affirmative action policies, late
twentieth century black conservatism, and the commodification of African American culture
seen in the wealth of the superstar athletes and hip hop entrepreneurs. Then, too, the new
technology led to the first two black billionaires, Robert Johnson (BET) and Oprah. And, did
the Internet with viral social networking websites, Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, Black Planet
Google+, “Black News,” “Griot” and YouTube streaming videos, provide a basis for Barack
Obama to emerge as the front-runner in the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.
But what about Civil Rights, the 1868 14th Amendment and the 1964 Civil Rights Act. What
does this say about, race/racism in America? What about Katrina in New Orleans in 2009 as
well as “the $40 Million Dollar slave,” 153 years after the 13th Amendment? Also, what has
been the impact of the nation’s changing racial demographics on African Americans in the 21st
century? And, how do we explain the continued racial violence in America and protest in
2014-2015 that claimed: “Black Lives Matter” and “I Can’t Breath”? Being among the last
generation of the millennial cohort, those consisting of individuals born from 1982-2004, how
do you view your future in America?

Most important as Frederick Douglas said in 1857
 “If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and deprecate
agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunder
and lightning. ….
People might not get all they work for in this world, but they must certainly work for all they get."

Students, a Research Paper Guide will be provided. In addition, as you begin to write your
research paper, please consider the Undergraduate Writing Center, which provides professional consulting- services
for students who want to improve their writing.
The Undergraduate Writing Center’s mission--improving undergraduate writing and supporting undergraduate
education at The University of Texas at Austin--has effective and ethical rhetoric at its core. We train our writing
consultants to approach each session from the following points of departure: the assignment of the particular instructor,
the expectations of the particular discipline, and the goals of the particular student.
Students can bring their assignments to the UWC and work with a consultant on any aspect of their writing--from
brainstorming, to developing and organizing an argument, to learning the conventions of usage and punctuation.
Their consultants will use my directions as well as your student notes to define the goals of each session, but ultimately,
students are responsible for the quality of their papers.
Also, consultants will be happy to send you a brief letter describing each session, if the student requests it.
The Undergraduate Writing Center Located in FAC 211 (Flawn Academic Center), and the UWC is open from 9 a.m.
to 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Friday.
Because of recent budget constraints that have limited our hiring, they are expecting an unprecedented demand for
our services this year. And although they will continue to work with students on a walk-in basis, students should be
encouraged to call ahead for an appointment (471-6222).

Information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found
at <http://www.utexas.edu/emergency>www.utexas.edu/emergency. Classroom Instruction
and Recommended Syllabus Information
To implement this policy and reinforce building evacuation procedures, each faculty member
shall provide the following information and instructions to students:
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling
outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may
occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week
of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-
enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of
Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses
subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other
protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. If you or someone you know has been harassed or
assaulted, you can find the appropriate resources here: http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-

Background on Campus Carry Laws in Texas                    In 2015, the Texas Legislature approved the "campus
carry" law, Senate Bill 11. The law provides that License to Carry (LTC) permit holders may carry a concealed
handgun throughout university campuses, starting Aug. 1, 2016. The law gives public universities some discretion to
regulate campus carry.
The University of Texas at Austin and President Gregory L. Fenves take issues surrounding guns on campus very
seriously and have worked to create policies that conform to the new law, protect the rights of citizens and ensure
the safety and security of the entire campusc
                                                           12


S.B. 11 provides that, after consulting with students, staffers and faculty members about "the nature of the student
population, specific safety considerations and the uniqueness of the campus environment," the university may enact
reasonable rules and regulations regarding the carrying of concealed handguns by license holders on campus.
The law stipulates, however, that these rules and regulations may not either "generally prohibit" or "have the effect
of generally prohibiting" license holders from carrying concealed handguns on campus.
Classroom
         Can I ban the carry of concealed handguns in my classroom?
         No. Faculty members cannot ban the concealed carry of handguns in their classrooms. Excluding handguns
         from classrooms would have had the effect of generally prohibiting student license holders from carrying
         their handguns, and thus would violate S.B. 11. Language in the law specifically forbids any policies that
         would generally prohibit campus carry or have the effect of generally prohibiting campus carry. That is
         why the concealed carry of handguns in classrooms is allowed.
General Information
         What do I do if I see a handgun in my classroom or on campus?
         If you see a gun, call 911.
         Campus carry requires that handguns remain concealed at all times with no exceptions, and if a handgun is
         visible, however briefly, it may be a violation of university policy and law. Notify law enforcement via 911
         and UTPD will arrive and assess the situation. Persons who violate these laws and policies are subject to
         penalties and fines in addition to disciplinary action imposed by the university.
         f your class is in a location where you cell phone does not get reception, identify the nearest location you
         can make a call at the beginning of the semester so you know where to go, if needed. If you have a TA or
         AI, have them leave and find the best place to call 911.
         Do faculty have a right to know if students are carrying a gun in class?
         No. Even if a faculty member were to ask, the LTC holder is not required to respond. Under Texas law,
         only law enforcement can verify whether a LTC holder is carrying and has a license to carry.

"This course may be used to fulfill three hours of the U.S. history component of the university core
curriculum and addresses the following four core objectives established by the Texas Higher Education
Coordinating Board: communication skills, critical thinking skills, personal responsibility, and social
responsibility."
COURSE DESCRIPTION
Assessments of the historic experience of African Americans from the Civil War and
Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Era and the Second Reconstruction, i.e., the post-Civil
Rights Era from the 1970s through 2017, provide the focus of this course. Emphasis will be
placed on the political, economic, including the business activities, as well as social and
cultural activities of African Americans. The course begins with assessing the Black American
experience during the Civil War and Reconstruction.                      In the immediate first post-
Reconstruction, the Exodus of 1879 is considered along with the founding and building of
Black Towns. Also, significant Supreme Court decisions, and extralegal means, including
violence, which led to the disfranchisement and segregation of Blacks, that is, the rise of Jim
Crow, at the turn of the century are discussed. The Great Migration of the WWI era is
examined and the ideologies of black leaders during that period (1900-1930), W.E.B. Du Bois,
Booker T. Washington, Ida B. Wells and Marcus Garvey are compared. Particularly, the
establishment of black businesses is examined and compared with white corporate America
during the turn of the early twentieth century Industrial Revolution.
The rise of the black urban ghetto and impact of the African American working class as it
relates to African American culture provide the focus for examining the twentieth century
Black Experience. The Harlem Renaissance, the conditions of blacks in the Great Depression,
their military participation in WWII, Ralph Bunche’s United Nation’s contribution, the Korean
Conflict and the 1954 Brown decision provide an introduction to the Black Freedom Movement
of the 1960s, including subsequent black military participation in Vietnam and Afghanistan.
Assessments are made of the riots in the 1960s, Los Angeles 1992, Ferguson 2014, Charlotte,
2016; ideologies of Black leaders, Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael,
Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker, Angela Davis, Kathleen Cleaver, black organizations, NAACP,
Urban League CORE, SNCC, Black Panthers, black fraternities/sororities. Agendas of post-Civil
rights era black leaders Jesse Jackson, Minister Louis Farrakhan, Rev. Al Sharpton and black
business leaders, Bob Johnson (BET), Oprah Winfrey, Houston-based Case Lawal. The post-
Civil Rights era rise of national black political leaders is examined: US Senators, Edward
Brooke, Carol Moseley-Braun and Congresswomen Shirley Chisholm, Barbara Jordan, Sheila
Jackson-Lee and presidential appointees: Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown, Secretary of
State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice and Attorney General Eric Holder appointed under
President Barack Hussein Obama the first African American president of the United States,
elected in 2008 and served to January 2017. Also, two African Americans have been
appointed Supreme Court Justices: Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice Clarence Thomas.
Yet, who are the rising new black political leaders such as New Jersey United States Senator
Cory Booker? Still, of all racial/ethnic groups in the US, African American incomes are at the
bottom and black business profits are less than 1% of total USA business profits.
The course ends with commentaries on the retrenchment in affirmative action policies, late
twentieth century black conservatism, and the commodification of African American culture
seen in the wealth of the superstar athletes and hip hop entrepreneurs. Then, too, the new
technology led to the first two black billionaires, Robert Johnson (BET) and Oprah. And, did
the Internet with viral social networking websites, Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, Black Planet
                                                     18


Google+, “Black News,” “Griot” and YouTube streaming videos, provide a basis for Barack
Obama to emerge as the front-runner in the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.
Significantly, the course begins with a Civil War, marking an end of slavery and the beginning
of black political participation. But what about Civil Rights, the 1868 14th Amendment and the
1964 Civil Rights Act. What does this say about, race/racism in America? What about Katrina
in New Orleans in 2009 as well as “the $40 Million Dollar slave,” 153 years after the 13th
Amendment? Also, what has been the impact of the nation’s changing racial demographics on
African Americans in the 21st century? And, how do we explain the continued racial violence
in America and protest in 2014-2015 that claimed: “Black Lives Matter” and “I Can’t Breath”?
Being among the last generation of the millennial cohort, those consisting of individuals born
from 1982-2004, how do you view your future in America?

The course is designed so that each student can get an A grade, but only if one attends all classes (university regulations
state a student who is absent more than three times must fail the course) and, studies diligently and consistently.
And, of course, A students are those who earn average A grades on all assignments.
Most important as Frederick Douglas said in 1857
 “If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and deprecate
agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunder
and lightning. ….
People might not get all they work for in this world, but they must certainly work for all they get."

ASSIGNMENT RESEARCH PAPER A research paper guide will be provided.
ALL RESEARCH PAPERS DUE BEFORE OR BY MAY 7- NO LATE RESEARCH PAPERS ACCEPTED
Students, a Research Paper Guide will be provided. In addition, as you begin to write your
research paper, please consider the Undergraduate Writing Center, which provides professional consulting services
for students who want to improve their writing.
The Undergraduate Writing Center’s mission--improving undergraduate writing and supporting undergraduate
education at The University of Texas at Austin--has effective and ethical rhetoric at its core. We train our writing
consultants to approach each session from the following points of departure: the assignment of the particular instructor,
the expectations of the particular discipline, and the goals of the particular student.
Students can bring their assignments to the UWC and work with a consultant on any aspect of their writing--from
brainstorming, to developing and organizing an argument, to learning the conventions of usage and punctuation.
Their consultants will use my directions as well as your student notes to define the goals of each session, but ultimately,
students are responsible for the quality of their papers.
Also, consultants will be happy to send you a brief letter describing each session, if the student requests it.
The Undergraduate Writing Center Located in FAC 211 (Flawn Academic Center), and the UWC is open from 9 a.m.
to 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Friday.
Because of recent budget constraints that have limited our hiring, they are expecting an unprecedented demand for
our services this year. And although they will continue to work with students on a walk-in basis, students should be
encouraged to call ahead for an appointment (471-6222).
To better familiarize your students with our the Undergraduate Writing Center services, the UWC brochure, which
details hours and policies can be downloaded from their main website at . www.uwc.utexas.edu.
Most important, your paper must be your own work. By following the above directions, there will be no
concern that your paper is not your own--See UT’S POLICIES at:

Background on Campus Carry Laws in Texas                    In 2015, the Texas Legislature approved the "campus
carry" law, Senate Bill 11. The law provides that License to Carry (LTC) permit holders may carry a concealed
handgun throughout university campuses, starting Aug. 1, 2016. The law gives public universities some discretion to
regulate campus carry.
The University of Texas at Austin and President Gregory L. Fenves take issues surrounding guns on campus very
seriously and have worked to create policies that conform to the new law, protect the rights of citizens and ensure
the safety and security of the entire campusc
                                                           27


S.B. 11 provides that, after consulting with students, staffers and faculty members about "the nature of the student
population, specific safety considerations and the uniqueness of the campus environment," the university may enact
reasonable rules and regulations regarding the carrying of concealed handguns by license holders on campus.
The law stipulates, however, that these rules and regulations may not either "generally prohibit" or "have the effect
of generally prohibiting" license holders from carrying concealed handguns on campus.
Classroom
         Can I ban the carry of concealed handguns in my classroom?
         No. Faculty members cannot ban the concealed carry of handguns in their classrooms. Excluding handguns
         from classrooms would have had the effect of generally prohibiting student license holders from carrying
         their handguns, and thus would violate S.B. 11. Language in the law specifically forbids any policies that
         would generally prohibit campus carry or have the effect of generally prohibiting campus carry. That is
         why the concealed carry of handguns in classrooms is allowed.
General Information
         What do I do if I see a handgun in my classroom or on campus?
         If you see a gun, call 911.
         Campus carry requires that handguns remain concealed at all times with no exceptions, and if a handgun is
         visible, however briefly, it may be a violation of university policy and law. Notify law enforcement via 911
         and UTPD will arrive and assess the situation. Persons who violate these laws and policies are subject to
         penalties and fines in addition to disciplinary action imposed by the university.
         f your class is in a location where you cell phone does not get reception, identify the nearest location you
         can make a call at the beginning of the semester so you know where to go, if needed. If you have a TA or
         AI, have them leave and find the best place to call 911.
         Do faculty have a right to know if students are carrying a gun in class?
         No. Even if a faculty member were to ask, the LTC holder is not required to respond. Under Texas law,
         only law enforcement can verify whether a LTC holder is carrying and has a license to carry.
