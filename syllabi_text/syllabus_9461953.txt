  Description:         This course will first examine the structure and economics of the
                       television industry in general and then use this knowledge as a
                       foundation to explore the particular structure and economics of sports

                                    COURSE OUTLINE
Approach:
  This course will be comprised of thirty (30) sessions (two sessions per week), including a
  mid-term examination and an examination on the last day of class (May 9), with each
  individual session being approximately seventy five (75) minutes in length. There will
                                                                                             2


   mixture of lecture by the principal instructor and guests, group discussion, student
   presentations and in-class quizzes and examinations.
Class Preparation:
   1. It is expected that each student will be prepared to participate in informed and
       constructive discussions.
   2. Reading assignments and homework must be done prior to attending class so that all
       students will benefit from an informed discussion of issues.
   3. All written assignments are to be typed. Spelling, grammar, and punctuation must
       conform to professional standards. If your written assignments incorporate
       concepts that originated with others, you must acknowledge your utilization of these
       concepts pursuant to MLA citation standards.
   4. All cell phones will be turned off prior to class and use of laptops is NOT permitted,
       except to take weekly quizzes on Canvas as discussed below. Students are
       encouraged to take notes using pen and paper.
Attendance:
   Students are expected to attend every class, which is critical to their success in the
   course and the success of the course itself. As noted below, a substantial proportion of
   each student’s grade will be attributable to in-class activities. Students should be
   prepared to start the class session on time. If for some reason, a student is unable to
   attend class, that student is expected to inform the instructor or GA via email prior to
   class. Being absent or late for class may result in a reduction of a student’s grade for the
   course. If a student misses a class for any reason, it is also the responsibility of the
   student to be informed of the materials covered during the class. Each student is
   encouraged to find a “class buddy” who can share information and assignments.
 Academic Integrity and Standards:
   Students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity in
   all course activities and assignments. It is expected that there shall be no deception
   regarding the representation made by the student of his/her preparation, participation or
   performance.
   Plagiarism is presenting another person’s work as though it is one’s own and is a form of
   fraud. Plagiarism includes (but is not limited to) the presentation of a sequence of words
   from another writer, utilized without proper attribution. It is critical that students properly
   acknowledge the work of others and that the acknowledgement be accurate and complete.
   The remainder of the course requirements and policies relating to cheating and plagiarism
   are subject to the standard policies and procedures for all UT-Austin students as established
   by UT-Austin
                                                                                                 3

daily, but at minimum twice a week—to stay current with university-related

give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the
absence.

Emergency Evacuation Policy
Occupants of buildings on the UT Austin campus are required to evacuate and assemble
outside when a fire alarm is activated or an announcement is made. Please be aware of the
following policies regarding evacuation:
    Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of the classroom and the building. Remember
        that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when you entered the
        building.
    If you require assistance to evacuate, inform me in writing during the first week of
        class.
    In the event of an evacuation, follow my instructions or those of class instructors.
Do not re-enter a building unless you’re given instructions by the Austin Fire Department,
the UT Austin Police Department, or the Fire Prevention Services office
Q drop Policy
The State of Texas has enacted a law that limits the number of course drops for academic
reasons to six (6). As stated in Senate Bill 1231:
        “Beginning with the fall 2007 academic term, an institution of higher education
may not permit an undergraduate student a total of more than six dropped courses,
including any course a transfer student has dropped at another institution of higher
education, unless the student shows good cause for dropping more than that number.”
You can find advice, models, templates, and other resources for designing your course
syllabus on the DIIA website at http://www.utexas.edu/academic/diia/

you have your smartphone or laptop with you in class (which may be used for quizzes
only). Also please note that unless you are in attendance, you will not be able to earn
points from that day’s quiz toward your final grade. Therefore, attendance is very

make a short presentation to the class about an aspect of sports television of interest to that
group.

multiple choice and/or true/false, profit/loss calculations and similar type questions and will
