TEXT & READINGS:                 Archaeological Research: A Brief Introduction
                                 by Peter N. Peregrine, 2nd Edition/2017
COURSE CONTENT:
         The purpose of this course to integrate disparate areas and interests in archaeology
that rarely come together in one course. This class will provide you (the course
participants) with a background to “the kinds” of archaeology that are in practice, “what”
is involved in archaeological analyses, and “how” archaeological analysis may be
approached, both in practical terms and in theoretical perspectives.
         We will review each of the aspects noted above first by reading chapters/papers
detailing some procedures. The class lectures will elaborate on various archaeological
interests and how “we” might approach these interests (whether historical, scientific,
artistic, or as utilized by “entrepreneurs”).
         A schedule of planned topics is provided on a separate page. The schedule serves
primarily as a guide to the order of topics. The actual amount of time spent on a particular
issue or topic will vary according to the needs of the class.
COURSE GRADING:
         Evaluation in this course will be through Four (4) Tests, One (1) Paper, and Class
Attendance/Participation. All Tests and the Paper are required and please note that there
are NO MAKE-UPS. Tests are valued at 20% each, “the Paper” is graded at 10%, and
class attendance/participation is valued at 10%.
         Tests are short answer, ID, Fill-in-the-Blank, and thoughtful response. The tests
are not cumulative, there is no “final exam” for this course. When tests are returned, any
questions or need of modification to the test evaluation must be done at/after the class
meeting when the test is returned. Test results will not be reevaluated at the end of the
semester. Any questions, confusion about the course grading, etc. should be
clarified/settled with Prof. Valdez as soon as possible. Tests will take place during a
regular class period, you will have the first hour of the class period to complete the test,
there may then be a lecture after test completion. You will not be allowed to take the test
if you are late.
