  “History is not just what is remembered but also what is consciously erased from memory, and those who
  seemingly engage in erasure are those with the most power and wealth who desecrate the created sacred space of
  historical and public memory.”
   —María Cristina Morales & Cynthia Bejarano, “Border Sexual Conquest: A Framework for Gendered and Racial
                                                       Sexual Violence, in Globalization and America, pp. 181-198
Instructor: Dr. Lilia Raquel Rosas
COURSE DESCRIPTION
The 1917 Bath Riots of El Paso, led by seventeen-year old Carmelita Torres, is a watershed moment in the
history of ethnic Mexican women. Illustrating the intersection between the local and global, we learn how
Mexicanas demanded their rights over their own bodies, and asserted dignity and respect in the backdrop
of the la frontera and the Revolution of 1910. Through this course, we will comprehensively examine the
history of ethnic Mexican women in the United States in the twentieth century. Beginning with the Mexican
Revolution, which led to the first major migration of Mexicans to the United States, we will study the lives
and roles of ethnic Mexican, (me)Xicanas, Chicanas, xicanindias, mestizas, indigenous, Mexican American,
and brown women within the U.S., and along the U.S.-Mexican borderlands. We also will explore how
gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, language, spirituality, and citizenship shaped their experiences, and
how the writing of their history has changed in the last one hundred years.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
Students will improve their analytical abilities through reading, writing, researching and discussing class
materials. As a CORE requirement, students will learn about the nuances of historical experiences of ethnic
Mexican, (me)Xicanas, Chicanas, xicanindias, mestizas, indigenous, Mexican American, and brown women
in the U.S.-Mexican borderlands. Ultimately, they will learn to think critically, and develop and defend
original arguments, investigate topics within of the scope of MALS and history and they will be able to:
    1. Be familiar and analyze the significant forces, events, and persons relevant to historical struggles
         over equality, identity, and social justice in the histories of Mexican, Mexican American women,
         and Chicanas.
    2. Use and prioritize the analytical lenses of gender and sexuality, along with race and class (among
         other lenses), to understand the identity formations, subjectivities, and the multiple oppressions
         confronted by Mexican, Mexican American women, and Chicanas.
    3. Recognize the importance of transborder migration, labor, education, political action, and social
         movements in shaping a diverse and pluralistic Mexican American women’s history.
This course carries 1-flag:
Cultural Diversity in the United States: Cultural Diversity courses are designed to increase your
familiarity with the variety and richness of the American cultural experience. You should therefore expect
a substantia portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories
of at least one U.S. cultural group that has experienced persistent marginalization.
This course meets core curriculum requirement for Social & Behavioral Science (I).
COMMUNICATION & CLASSROOM SUCCESS
Please feel free to email me since this is the best and most effective way to contact me. I check it frequently,
so email me whenever you have questions or concerns. I also strongly encourage you to talk to me during
office hours, before or after class, or make an appointment with me if you have any questions, comments,
or other issues.
In my experience, students who stop by to talk, email, or communicate frequently, attend class regularly,
participate in the classroom discussion, and complete the assigned readings, and all assignments tend to
be more successful in the class. Similarly, I will email you regularly with reminders, instructions, and late
breaking information. Last, if I ever cancel class, Canvas is how you will know it, so please check messages
daily.

Additional articles and chapter excerpts will be made available on CANVAS or via an online link. Readings
and handouts distributed in class and/or via Canvas during the course of the semester will become also
part of your required readings.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS
Attendance: Attendance is required and repeated absences will be noted by detrimentally impacting your
participation grade. When missing class, you must provide a valid reason for your absence with appropriate
documentation. This policy does not include absences due to university-related activities (sports,
conferences), or to serious medical issues (severe illness) or death in the immediate family, which are
excused and not deducted (with documentation). Three (3) or more unexcused or “no contact “absences
will result in the overall grade reduction of full letter grade (10%).
Class Participation: Come prepared and on time to class. This includes that you bring the appropriate
reading(s) and course materials, and complete the assigned reading. Make sure when you read, you
read actively. Consider questions such as the following while you read, which may also help with your
regular journaling assignment: What is the argument or purpose of this work or chapter? What kind of
issue(s) are the authors addressing? Why is this reading significant? How can I highlight a significant
point(s) in the class discussion through a specific example(s)? What questions or issues does the reading
cause me to reflect about in my own understanding?
Assignments will include:
Attendance and Participation: Be ready to attend, discuss, and engage in class actively. This is explained
more fully under “Attendance” and “Class Participation,” in the syllabus (see above).
Reading Journal: You also will be responsible for maintaining a reading journal throughout the semester
that you will create and keep up on Canvas. This will be a place to reflect on select assigned reading for
that class/week day and offer your thoughts for class colleagues to consider as well. The purpose of the
journal is to cultivate a practice of active, critical, and evaluative reading, which ultimately will be beneficial
in your development as a researcher and writer.
Critical Essay: Through a prompt provided by the instructor, you will write 4-6-page critical essay where
you will engage in a close reading of select readings thus far to explore relevant themes and other significant
topics.
Co-curricular Event Reflection: Throughout the semester, you will have the opportunity to attend one UT
(or outside) lecture, event, or film to be determined as the semester progresses. It must intersect with the
class description and you must provide a brief synopsis of the event and, most importantly, an explanation
of the connection between the event and our discussions in this class.
Group Presentation: You will organize, collaborate, and deliver a group presentation covering one of the
selected present-day or contemporary U.S. social justice themes inspired by the texts at the end of the
semester. I organize the groups but do my best to place you in your preferred group. Still, I may arbitrarily
assign you to a group.
Final Project: In this final project, you will have several options: 1) You may conduct an oral history and
write a critical account of a local or homegrown Mexican, Mexican American woman, or Chicanas thinker,
writer, community leader, or activist; 2) You will write a zine about a preapproved topic integral to Mexican
American women’s history; OR 3) Develop your own innovative or original project such as a play,
handbook, website, short film, underscoring Mexican American women’s history with the consolation with
the professor.

The grade distribution for each requirement/assignment will be as follows and none are negotiable:
              • Attendance and Participation                                           15%
              • Reading Journal                                                        15%
              • Critical Essay                                                         20%
              • Co-curricular Event Reflection                                         10%
              • Group Presentation                                                     20%
              • Final Project                                                          20%
Class Expectations: Learning Principle: This course uses the principle of collaborative learning or seminar
format. In other words, I believe the classroom is a place of mutual respect and shared learning. In
addition, it is a place where everyone’s informed or well-thought comments will be valued. This means
we are here to learn from each other. I expect you to participate by listening, making comments,
responding to your classmates, and asking questions. In turn, I will facilitate, direct, summarize, and clarify
the discussion. Participation means more than just coming to class and hoping that you can get the answers
from the instructor or the students who talk a lot. Collaborative learning means that it is your responsibility
to share your own considered perspective on the assigned reading, assignment, or topic. In turn, the class
will be structured to make sure that your views will enhance our understanding of the purpose of each
class discussion.
Common Courtesy: Overall, you are also expected to conduct yourself appropriately by turning off your
cell phones and other electronic devices or safely securing them in a pocket, purse, backpack, or book bag
with the ringer/tones turned off. Texting or “secret surfing/chatting” on computers (other devices) in
our classroom (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Hulu, Netflix, etc.)
is also not allowed. While these may seem like minor infractions, they contribute to a disrespectful and
unprofessional classroom environment that interferes with the work all of us are trying to accomplish
together.
COURSE POLICIES
Statement on Learning Success: Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations
because we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude
you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we will develop strategies to meet both your needs
and the requirements of the course. I also encourage you to reach out to the student resources available
through UT Austin. Many are listed on this syllabus, but I am happy to connect you with a person or
Center if you would like.
Grading: The final course grade will be assigned based on the completion of the course requirements
within the semester and will adhere the following grading scale:
            Grade           Cutoff
            A               94%
            A-              90%
            B+              87%
            B               84%
            B-              80%
            C+              77%
            C               74%
            C-              70%

Assignment Guidelines and Late Work: I will distribute detailed guidelines as we approach certain assignments
such as the essays, final project, and presentation. All assigned work is due on the due date, and is submitted
via Canvas.
Please do not count on uploading/submitting your assignments via Canvas right before the class meeting
time. Inevitably, the computer labs are crowded or servers fail when you are in such a rush, and these are
not valid excuses for late assignments.
Late assignments will be penalized one-half grade (5 points) if turned in within 48 hours of the due date,
and one full grade (10 points) if turned in within one calendar week of the due date. After that, they will
be penalized 15 points every day. I also reserve the right to grade these papers until the end of the semester.
Late papers will only be accepted without penalty if you negotiate an alternative due date with me at
least 48 hours prior to the due date and turn in the paper within a week of the original deadline. Likewise,
it is up to my discretion to decide which circumstances constitute the need for an alternative due date.
Otherwise, late papers will be penalized according to the aforementioned guidelines.
Student Rights & Responsibilities:
      • You have a right to a learning environment that supports mental and physical wellness.
      • You have a right to respect.
      • You have a right to be assessed and graded fairly.
      • You have a right to freedom of opinion and expression.
      • You have a right to privacy and confidentiality.
      • You have a right to meaningful and equal participation, to self-organize groups to improve your

      • You have a right to learn in an environment that is welcoming to all people. No student shall be
          isolated, excluded or diminished in any way.
With these rights come responsibilities:
     • You are responsible for taking care of yourself, managing your time, and communicating with the
         teaching team and with others if things start to feel out of control or overwhelming.
     • You are responsible for acting in a way that is worthy of respect and always respectful of others. •
         Your experience with this course is directly related to the quality of the energy that you bring to it,
         and your energy shapes the quality of your peers’ experiences.
     • You are responsible for creating an inclusive environment and for speaking up when someone is
         excluded.
     • You are responsible for holding yourself accountable to these standards, holding each other to
         these standards, and holding the teaching team accountable as well.
Personal Pronoun Preference: Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to
individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender,
gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name.
I will gladly honor your request to address you by a name different than what appears on the roster, and
by the gender pronouns you use. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may
make appropriate changes to my records.

UNIVERSITY POLICIES
Academic Integrity: Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code:
“As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University
and uphold academic integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words
or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources.
Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of
the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor
Code         which         can       be       found        at      the      following       web      address:
http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
Religious Holy Days
By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date
of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a
project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work
within a reasonable time after the absence.
Q Drop Policy: If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before
the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only
allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see:
http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
University Resources for Students: Services for Students with Disabilities: This class respects and welcomes
students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are circumstances that make our learning
environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information that you need to share with me, or if
you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am
committed to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss
your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If
appropriate, also contact Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986
(video phone). http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
Counseling and Mental Health Center: Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating
well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle.
You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the
college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often
helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like
anxiety      or       depression,       we      strongly      encourage      you      to     seek    support.
http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html
The Sanger Learning Center: Did you know that more than one-third of UT undergraduate students use
the Sanger Learning Center each year to improve their academic performance? All students are welcome
to take advantage of Sanger Center’s classes and workshops, private learning specialist appointments, peer
academic coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses in 15 different subject areas. For more

Title IX Reporting: Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination,
sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally
funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment
free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university
can:
     1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
     2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have
          become involved in a Title IX investigation.
     3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory
Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator.
I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in
writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a
Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with
someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email
advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and resources, visit
titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu.
Emergency Evacuation: The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the
Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/ state:
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling
outside.
     •    Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy.
          Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
     •    Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
          week of class.
     •    In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-
          enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The
          University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
