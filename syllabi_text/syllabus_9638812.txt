1. OBJECTIVES OF THE LANGUAGE PROGRAM
The objective of the Spanish language program addresses the basic tenet of a liberal arts
education: the development of a critical thinking approach towards the analysis of language in
society. This objective is framed in an overall worldwide trend towards political and economical
internationalization and an increasingly diverse and multicultural work environment.
The Spanish language program focuses on the development of multilingual literacies through the
analysis and use of Spanish as a second language. The program focuses on the development of
three major types of competencies (all equally ranked in terms of importance):
    1. linguistic competence (Spanish phonetics / phonology, morphosyntax, lexicon,
        discourse, etc.)
    2. communication / interactional competence (sociocultural uses of the language,
        pragmatics, cultural background / perspectives)
    3. metalinguistic competence (language as a conceptual, symbolic system)
2. COURSE DESCRIPTION AND GOALS
SPN 601D is the first course in the University of Texas lower-division Spanish Program. The
course focuses on developing speaking, listening, reading and writing skills in Spanish, while
building vocabulary, learning basic rules and terminology of Spanish grammar, and gaining a
better understanding of Hispanic cultures in order to communicate in an accurate, effective, and
informed manner within a variety of sociocultural situations.
By the end of the semester, you should be able to do the following in Spanish:
a.      Understand the main ideas in a variety of discourse genres (e.g. radio advertisements,
presentations, newspaper articles).
b.      Use reading strategies to search for specific information in longer texts.
c.      Participate in unrehearsed conversations about familiar topics


3. PLACEMENT / PREREQUISITES

5. COURSE TEXTBOOK AND RESOURCES
Textbook:         Conectándonos (Salaberry, Barrette, Fernandez-Garcia and Nevárez).
2nd edition. Dubuque, IA: Kendall Hunt, 2015 [at the Co-op]
Website:     www.grtep.com
Talk Abroad TalkAbroad.com is a website that permits you to video chat with native speakers
of Spanish who are trained in helping you to converse. A 30 minute conversation costs $15, and
one of these is required during the summer session.
6. ATTENDANCE POLICY
 A. Attendance is required at all classes and is checked daily. You must attend class the first
two class meetings. Because of high demand to add Spanish classes, the Department will drop
from these courses any students who are absent the first two class meetings of the summer
session.


B. All absences count (except religious holidays, documented jury duty, documented military
duty, and university-sponsored activities). Your instructor will take attendance at the beginning
of each 50-minute session (i.e. twice per day). Up to five 50-minute session absences will not
result in a reduction of your final grade because of the absence itself. However, each absence
during a 50-minute session beyond five, regardless of the reason for the absence, will carry a 1%
penalty toward your final grade. Note: Arriving more than 20 minutes late counts as an absence. 4
tardies (arriving to class at least 5 minutes late) equal one absence.
7. POLICY ON MISSED WORK
  Reason for              Procedures

                                Form” (posted on Canvas), along with the appropriate documentation
                                A Supervisory Committee will determine whether or not you may
                                receive grade averaging for your missed assessment(s).
8. FINAL EXAM
Both the listening and written sections of the final exam will be administered during the final
examination period.
 Students can access their individual exam schedule at http://registrar.utexas.edu/students/exams
There is absolutely NO MAKE-UP FINAL and students who miss the regularly scheduled
final will receive a grade of 0 for the exam. CHECK YOUR SCHEDULE NOW TO MAKE
SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE A CONFLICT WITH THE FINAL EXAM!!!
9. GRADING SCALE
There is no curve or extra credit available in this course. If your final average is 89.9, your
course grade will be a B+. Do not expect to receive a passing grade simply because you complete
all requirements. To receive an “A”, all or most of your work must be excellent. A “B” indicates


that your work is very good. A “C” means that your work is adequate and you may continue with
the next course. Please keep in mind that a grade of C or higher in this course is required in
order to continue in Spanish. A grade of C- or Pass is not sufficient to go to the next level.
Final letter grades are assigned according to the following scale:
  93-100 A 83-86.9 B            73-76.9 C     63-66.9 D
 90-92.9 A- 80-82.9 B- 70-72.9 C- 60-62.9 D-
 87-89.9 B+ 77-79.9 C+ 67-69.9 D+ 0-59.9 F
10. GRADE DISTRIBUTION AND COURSE ASSESSMENTS

 3 Exams (one per unit)                         25%
 Final exam                                     20%
 TOTAL                                          100%
TALK ABROAD: Toward the end of the semester, you will have a 30-minute conversation online
with a native speaker from a Spanish-speaking country. This assessment will consist of a pre-
activity (which will help you prepare), the conversation itself, and an in-depth follow-up activity,


in which you will comment on the content of your conversation, as well as observations you have
made about your language skills.
AT-HOME ONLINE ACTIVITIES: Paralleling the organization of the main text, the online
activities (www.grtep.com) will provide meaningful practice and review outside of class. Your
instructor will give you specific directions.
HOMEWORK: Your Instructor will assign homework on a daily basis and will periodically collect
these assignments and/or give a pop-quiz over their content. Your lowest homework score will be
dropped.
IN-CLASS WORK: You will be assessed on a variety of in -class assignments during the
semester. These may take the form of pair/group activities, in - class activities, participation,
etc. Your lowest score in this grading category will be dropped.
¡A HABLAR!: This is one of the oral components of the course. Every two or three chapters, you
will spend 30 minutes, approximately, speaking in small groups. These discussions will be
unrehearsed, and will relate directly to the chapter themes. Your grade will be based on your
ability to express yourself, maintain a conversation and interact effectively with others. The dates
are listed on your course calendar.
IN-CLASS WRITING ACTIVITIES: At the end of each unit, there is a Final Chapter Writing
Task in which you will need to demonstrate your mastery of the chapter content, in terms of
vocabulary, grammar and pragmatics. Each task has a unique objective and stresses a different
communicative skill. The dates are listed on your course calendar.
QUIZZES: There will be several quizzes throughout the semester (online and/or written). Each
will cover topics of chapters, focusing on both grammar and vocabulary, as well as reading and
listening skills. These quizzes will help you determine your strengths and weaknesses in order to
better prepare for the exams. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.
EXAMS: There will be three comprehensive exams throughout the semester. Exam 1 will cover
chapters 1 and 2. Exam 2 will cover chapters 4, 5 and 6. Exam 3 will cover chapters 7 and 8. The
focus of each exam will be the material from the most recent chapters. However, since learning a
second language is a cumulative process, you should also expect to encounter previous material
on exams. Exam dates are listed on your course calendar.
FINAL EXAM: The final exam is comprehensive and will assess your knowledge of vocabulary,
grammar and pragmatic / sociolinguistic material covered throughout the semester. It will also
assess the fundamental skills developed in the course (e.g. listening comprehension, reading,
writing, and data analysis). Please remember that (1) the listening section will be given the last
day of class and (2) the written section will be on the uniform date/time released by the
registrar. There are no make-ups. Please see additional information in Section 8 of this syllabus.


11. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ASSESSMENTS
Throughout the semester, you will be acquiring knowledge (e.g. vocabulary, grammar) and you
will be developing skills (e.g. reading strategies, data analysis). Therefore, course assessments are
designed to reflect your progress in both of these areas. Assessments can include material not
explicitly studied, but that is closely related to the course content and tests a student’s ability to
apply acquired information and abilities to unfamiliar situations and contexts.
KNOWLEDGE
Vocabulary: You are responsible for all words and phrases on the vocabulary lists. You should
know the meaning, gender and spelling of these items. Furthermore, you will be expected to use
these words within a context. Therefore, make sure you know not only the English translations
for the words, but also understand how they would be used in Spanish discourse.
Grammar: You are expected to know all grammar structures included in the course
syllabus. Make sure you fully understand all formulas and rules. For verb conjugations, you will
be expected to know how to conjugate not only regular verbs, but also irregular verbs and verbs
with spelling and stem changes.
Terminology: In order to talk effectively about language, you will be expected to know the
appropriate terminology. You should be prepared to answer questions involving technical
linguistic terminology and/or identify these elements both in class and on exams or other
assessments.
Sociocultural: Your instructor will expose you to different interactional contexts and a variety of
dialects and their principal characteristics throughout the semester. You must familiarize yourself
with this material and will be expected to recognize these features on exams and other graded
assignments.
SKILLS
Reading: Of the four skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking), the ability to read is typically
retained for the longest period of time. With this natural tendency in mind, one of the main goals
of our program is to develop strong reading skills that will stay with you for years to come. In this
course, you will be given many opportunities to develop these skills, both in groups and
individually, both at home and in-class. You will develop skills such as skimming, recognizing
cognates, making inferences, etc. It is in your best interest to work pro-actively on developing
these reading skills at home, since you will be tested on your ability to read and comprehend
unfamiliar texts containing unfamiliar vocabulary and to do so with relative speed.
Data analysis: Our department implements a guided inductive approach to language
learning. This means that you will be exposed to language data (written or oral) and will be
encouraged to formulate your own rules and test your own hypotheses regarding language forms
and structures. Since a substantial part of the course will involve this type of data analysis, you


should expect to be tested on this skill via graded assignments and exams. In other words, you
will not only be expected to reproduce language practiced in the classroom, but will also be given
new data, about which you will be asked to draw conclusions.
12. STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES
In order to be successful in this course, students must fulfill several responsibilities both in class
and at home and must also be able to demonstrate their progress in course assessments.
Homework: Your instructor will assign homework regularly. Many of these assignments are
given in order to prepare you for the following class day. Therefore, it is imperative that you
complete this work in order to be able to participate in class. Homework is also given to provide
you with ample opportunities to practice the course material and identify potential areas of
weakness. As a result, you will experience an increase in self-awareness, which will enable you
to take a pro-active stance in your progress, thus becoming a more effective learner overall.
Studying: You should not limit your work at home only to homework assignments collected by
your instructor for a grade. Instead, you should also study the course material on a regular basis,
since attempts to memorize large amounts of material quickly before an exam are not normally
successful. You should frequently review grammar rules, vocabulary lists, etc. and take note of
any items you may not understand. This will enable you to ask your instructor important questions
and resolve issues before a quiz or exam.
Practice: Students often rely exclusively on more passive activities such as re-reading or staring
at tables and lists of words / rules. This type of traditional studying is not sufficient in a language
course. Students who don’t actively use the target language at home often don’t develop the
automaticity necessary to successfully complete exams and compositions within a limited time
frame. Therefore, on a regular basis, you should also set aside time to:
     • practice conjugating verbs
     • practice writing sentences, letters, essays, etc.
     • practice reading newspaper articles, ads, etc.
     • practice speaking with friends and/or classmates
     • practice listening via news broadcasts, television or online videos
Interaction: Language courses are not lecture courses. Instead, classes are student-centered and
rely heavily on interaction and collaboration between you and your peers. Much of your work will
be pair work and group work, where students are the main participants and the instructor is the
facilitator. All students are expected to participate equally in these activities.
Focus: The focus of your attention should be on classroom activities while you are in class. Smart
phones, tablets, laptops and outside reading materials are NOT allowed in class, as they limit your
participation and are also generally disruptive and disrespectful.
Spanish: In order to improve your oral communication skills, you must practice both listening to
and speaking Spanish! Therefore, your instructor will speak almost exclusively in Spanish, which
will not only help you learn new vocabulary and grammar structures, but will also increase your


comfort level over the course of the semester. In turn, you are expected to speak in Spanish during
all activities and for basic functional language (e.g. saying hello, asking to go to the bathroom,
asking the instructor to repeat something, etc.). Don’t be shy! You won’t be graded on the
accuracy of your speech in these situations. You are, however, expected to make the effort.
13. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
The University provides, upon request, appropriate academic adjustments for qualified students
with disabilities. Any students with a documented disability (physical or cognitive) who require
academic accommodations should contact the Services for Students with Disabilities area of the
Office of the Dean of Students, 471-6259, as soon as possible to request an official letter outlining
authorized accommodations. Before course accommodations can be made, the letter from SSD
must be presented to the instructor. Approved accommodations will not change the basic elements
of the course.
14. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
The University’s honor Code states: “the core values of the University of Texas at Austin are
learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. Each member
of the university is expected to uphold these values through integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and
respect toward peers and community.” Please note that all graded work (e.g. essays, homework)
done inside or outside of class must be your own work. Writing that appears to be the work of
someone else (e.g. a friend more proficient in Spanish, a Web or print source) or that appears to
have been written in English and then translated by an online translation program will not be
accepted, and may entail severe penalties beyond just a zero on the particular assignment. Students
who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties,
including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the university. Since
dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the university, policies on
academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced. For more information, visit the Student Judicial
Services website at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/
15. STUDENT CONDUCT
Any student who, acting singly or in concert with others, obstructs, disrupts, or interferes with any
teaching, educational, research, administrative, disciplinary, public service, or other activity or
public performance authorized to be held or conducted on campus or on property or in a building
or facility owned or controlled by the U.T. System or institution is subject to discipline. For more
information, visit http://www.utsystem.edu/bor/rules/50000Series/50101.pdf.
16. EMERGENCY EVACUATION
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate
buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and
assembling outside. Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you
may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the
building. Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during


 the first week of class. In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class
 instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire
 Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police department, or Fire Prevention Services
 office. Information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be
 found at http://www.utexas.edu/emergency.
