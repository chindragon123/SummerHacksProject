                  ANS 340 / RS 341: Death and Dying in South Asia
                                           Instructor: Dr. Claire Maes
Course Description
“It is hard to have patience with people who say, ‘There is no death’ or ‘Death doesn’t matter.’ There is
death. And whatever is matters. And whatever happens has consequences, and it and they are irrevocable
and irreversible.” (C.S. Lewis 1996 [1961]: 15) Subscribing to these short but powerful statements, this
course explores the various beliefs, practices, attitudes, and understandings of the dying experience,
death, and the afterlife across South Asian cultural areas. During the course of the semester, we will be
looking at the philosophical, ethical, and legal issues of death from a variety of perspectives. We will
explore in detail how South Asian religious traditions have been approaching the problem of death within
their broader cultural, historical, and social contexts. We will focus on various religious traditions, among
others Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Central themes will include the changing meaning of death,
burial rites, and controversial death practices. Discussions will center on the questions of ‘What is a good
death?’, ‘What does the end of life mean for oneself and for others?’ and most basically but importantly
‘What is life?’ and ‘How is it envisioned after death?’ We will work with religious and philosophical
treatises on death, as well as with different types of ethnographies, documentaries, and feature-length
films.
Goals
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
     - argue that death and our attitude towards death have, as anything else, a history
     - recognize and displace ethnocentric views of South Asia
     - describe and contextualize different understandings of death in South Asia
     - read primary Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu sources in translation with an understanding of the
         worldview embedded in and represented by these sources
     - discuss different funerary rites and rituals in South Asia
                                                                                                            1

Class Policies
Come to class on time. During class, all electronic devices must be switched off or put on silent mode.
Since using a laptop distracts oneself and other students, laptops may not be used in class either.
Global Cultures
This course carries the Global Cultures flag. Global Cultures courses are designed to increase your
familiarity with cultural groups outside the United States. You should therefore expect a substantial
portion of your grade to come from assignments covering the practices, beliefs, and histories of at least
one non-U.S. cultural group, past or present.
University Policies

Scholastic Dishonesty and Academic Integrity: Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic
credit will be the student's own work. Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are
subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the
University. “Scholastic dishonesty” includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying
academic records, and any act designed to give unfair academic advantage to the student (such as, but
not limited to, submission of essentially the same written assignment for two courses without the prior
permission of the instructor, providing false or misleading information in an effort to receive a
postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment), or the attempt to commit such an
act. For further information please visit the Student Judicial Services Web site:

Documented Disability Statement: UT Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact Services for
Students with Disabilities at 471-6259 (voice) or 232-2937 (video phone) or

Religious Observances: By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence at least fourteen
days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a
work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to
complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
Mental Health Resources: Mental health concerns such as anxiety, stress, and depression are very
common among college students. If you are struggling with any of these or other mental health concerns,
you are not alone! I encourage you to seek help and to encourage others who need help to do so. There
is a 24/7 Crisis Line for UT students: 512-471-CALL (2255). Additionally, the UT Counseling and Mental
Health Center (CMHC) can be reached at 512-471-3515 during regular hours. There are a variety of self-
care programs (MindBody Labs, etc.) available to students in addition to more traditional counseling
services.
