 I.        Rationale
 This lecture/lab course is designed to introduce students to the concepts and current trends for virtual
 instruments. Looking closely at Kontakt, Serum, and many other industry-leading tools, students will learn
 how to create samplers and design their own synths, while also learning to “orchestrate” musical ideas.
 Students who successfully complete the course will be skilled in using virtual instruments to produce and
 arrange in a variety of contemporary musical settings.
 Course Prerequisite(s): AET 305 Foundations of Music Technology
 II.       Course Aims and Objectives
 By the end of this course, students will:
 •    Utilize industry-leading samples and synths in an effective manner.
 •    Create their own sampler instruments for use in a musical setting.
 •    Understand how to arrange a complex composition from pre-existing MIDI data.
 •    Think critically about how to design a synth for a specific musical purpose.
 •    Evaluate virtual sounds with greater sonic acuity.
III.       Tentative Course Schedule
 This schedule is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor. Students will be notified of such changes

IV.    Course Requirements
       Class attendance and participation policy:
       Regular and punctual attendance at all classes is required. Attendance is taken at the beginning of
       every class. Absences of each student are recorded without exception from the official date of
                                                     2


AET 341 Course Syllabus
       her/his enrollment. Both tardiness and early departure from class are forms of absenteeism. 15
       minutes late to the start of class will constitute a tardy. At the end of each class, tardy students must
       make the instructor aware of their attendance or they will be marked as absent. Leaving class before
       being dismissed by your professor will constitute an early departure. Two instances of tardiness or
       early departure equal one absence. A class in which a student is tardy and departs early on the same
       day is considered an absence. If a serious medical or personal situation occurs affecting attendance,
       please discuss it with your professor.
       Course Readings/Materials:
        I will post reading materials as necessary.
       Supplies needed:
       Over-the-ear headphones and external hard drive. REQUIRED every class meeting!
       Use of Canvas in class:
       In this class I use Canvas—a Web-based course management system with password-protected
       access at http://courses.utexas.edu —to distribute course materials, to communicate and
       collaborate online, to post grades, to submit assignments.
V.     Grading Procedures
       Grades will be based on:
       1. Projects/Quizzes                                             50%
       2. Final Project                                                25%
       3. Midterm Project                                              15%
       4. Class Participation /Attendance                              10%
       Grading Scale:
       Final grades will be determined on the basis of the following rubric. Please note: to ensure
       fairness, all numbers are absolute, and will not be rounded up or down at any stage. Thus a B- will
       be inclusive of all scores of 80.000 through 83.999. The University does not recognize the grade
       of A+.
       A = 94-100
       A- = 90-93
       B+ = 87-89
       B = 84-86
       B- = 80-83
       C+ = 77-79
       C = 74-76
       C- = 70-73
       D+ = 67-69
       D = 64-66
       D- = 60-63
       F = 0-60
       Late/Missed Assignments:
       If you miss an examination or an assignment deadline due to a serious, documented medical or
       personal situation, I will give you an opportunity to complete the work within a reasonable time.
       Otherwise, late assignments will receive a maximum grade value of 50%. May 8th is the last call for
       any late assignments from the semester (graded at 50% maximum value).
                                                        3


AET 341 Course Syllabus
VI.       Academic Integrity
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The
University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic
integrity.” Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT. Therefore, if you use words or ideas that are not your
own (or that you have used in previous class), you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of
plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible
for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code, which can be found at the
following web address: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/sjs/acint_student.php
VII.      Other University Notices and Policies
 Use of E-mail for Official Correspondence to Students
All students should become familiar with the University's official e-mail student notification policy. It is the
student's responsibility to keep the University informed as to changes in his or her e-mail address. Students
are expected to check e-mail on a frequent and regular basis in order to stay current with University-related
communications, recognizing that certain communications may be time-critical. It is recommended that e-
mail be checked daily, but at a minimum, twice per week. The complete text of this policy and instructions
for updating your e-mail address are available at http://www.utexas.edu/its/help/utmail/1564 .
Q drop Policy
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop
deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six
Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution.
For more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop
University Resources for Students
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn
differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me
know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of
the course. There are also a range of resources on campus:
Services for Students with Disabilities
This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are
circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information
that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be
evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment for all
students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain
the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact:
Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone).
http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/about/
Counseling and Mental Health Center
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and
alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope
with stress.
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources
available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking
for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

Emergency Evacuation Policy
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the Office of Campus Safety and
Security, 512-471-5767, http://www.utexas.edu/safety/
Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings
when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling
outside.
  •   Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember
      that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
  •   Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first
      week of class.
  •   In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a
      building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas
      at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
  •   Link to information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found
      at: www.utexas.edu/emergency
Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code states that a student shall be excused from attending classes
     or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day, including
     travel for that purpose. A student whose absence is excused under this subsection may not be penalized
     for that absence and shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment from which the
     student is excused within a reasonable time after the absence. University policy requires students to
     notify each of their instructors at least fourteen days prior to the date they will be absent from scheduled
     classes to observe a religious holy day.
