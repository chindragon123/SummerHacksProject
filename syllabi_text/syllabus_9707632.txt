                             Taiwan: Colonization, Migration, and Identity
Description: Contemporary Taiwan’s claims of an ethnic identity distinct from the Chinese mainland reference a history
of multiple colonizations and migrations to and from the island. This course will explore questions of ethnicity, empire,
and modernization in East Asia from the sixteenth century to the present through encounters between aborigines, Han
Chinese, Dutch, Portuguese, the imperial Qing, Fujianese, Japanese, mainlander KMT, and the United States on Taiwan.
