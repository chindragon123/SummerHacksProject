PROFESSOR: LAURA G. GUTIÉRREZ
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course uses a set of interdisciplinary methods (mainly ethnic studies, Latina/o
studies, cultural studies, and performance studies) to help us understand the kind of
'work' culture is doing in a larger framework, historical, economical, and societal. The
class uses these theoretical and methodological lenses to examine transnational
Latina/o popular culture from the 20th and 21st centuries in order to consider the ways in
which it has been an important aspect of nation-building strategies on different scales,
from nation-states to Latina/o communities in the US. We pay particular attention to
expressive culture from the beginning of the 20th century, focusing on social dance forms
like samba, tango, and danzón. Additionally, sports spectacles are analyzed to
understand the performance of masculinity, the interconnected between politics and
‘entertainment’ (soccer) and the theatricality of the spectacle (lucha libre—Mexican
masked wrestling). The course material moves through the 20th century and into the 21st
century and across geo-political divides to continue to put forward the idea that Latina/o
popular culture is transnational (at the same time as translocal); cultural works that will
be examined in order to grasp a full understanding of this notion run the gamut from the
formation of salsa to the reggeatón phenomenon and telenovela (Latin American soap
operas) industry to music television. In a more general way, the ultimate goal of the
class is to get the student to think about the ways in which popular cultural forms are
part of a 20th and 21st century sensibility that is both part of “the practice of everyday life”
and nation-building projects. But the student will be asked to think about how different
publics consume popular culture (at times transforming it and/or changing its meaning)
and, likewise, it is important to consider what happens when Latin American popular
culture (thanks to the (transnational) cultural industries) travels, often across geo-political
and linguistic borders (all within the hemisphere of the Americas). The operating
question throughout the semester is then, what is transnational about Latina/o popular
culture and why does this matter?

ADDITIONAL AUDIO/VISUAL MATERIAL
Music and music videos will be played and/or shown during lecture class and, at the
discretion of the professor. At times, students may propose music/music video to
play/watch during class or during a presentation.
REQUIREMENTS:
• Attendance and Active class participationà20%
• One short class presentation-à20%
• Three short papers (3 pages; 10% each)à30%
• Final Research Paperà30%
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:
ATTENDANCE AND ACTIVE CLASS PARTICIPATION (20%):
Attendance is absolutely crucial (5%). You are allowed a total of TWO excused
absences. After two absences, your final grade will be lowered by 5% points for each
unexcused absence beyond the allowed limit of one. Tardiness will not be tolerated;
please arrive to class on time.
The students are entirely responsible for class material that is covered during class
lectures and discussions. The professor will not hold additional hours to cover material
missed because of an absence. Office hours are exclusively for the review of material or
if the student needs additional guidance (understanding concepts, historical contexts,
etc).
                                                                                           2

                      DEPARTMENT	  OF	  MEXICAN	  AMERICAN	  AND	  LATINA/O	  STUDIES
There is an active participation component to your grade so you must come prepared to
participate actively in the discussion of the assigned texts/materials. If class discussions
become too professor-centered, the professor will upload questions that the student
must then bring to class, with answers, in order to earn participation grade. The
professor will ask each student to bring in a text to class to share and discuss.
Additionally, you must be willing to listen to your fellow classmates and respond
intelligently and respectfully.
This is 15% of your grade, split this way: regular active participation (10%) and one rapid
presentation that asks the student to bring in a text and a question to discuss with class
for 5 minutes (5%)
SHORT PAPERS (30%):
You will have three 3-page papers (each worth 10%) based on course readings. These
papers are designed to gauge your ability to synthesize the readings and to take a
rigorously argued and logical position vis-à-vis that material. They are intended for the
student to be able to expand the ideas that have been generated by the reading and/or
viewings of films and in lecture and discussion sections. I will upload 4 questions (at the
most, but perhaps 3) onto canvas and you will be asked to base your short essay on one
of those questions. The papers are due during class and NO LATER!
SHORT IN-CLASS PRESENTATION (20%)
I am committed to a collective learning process and, to this end, towards the end of the
semester, I would like each student to present on their ongoing research project that has
used as its base some of the theoretical ideas and concepts in class in order to examine
a popular cultural text. The presentation will be dynamic and could and should use visual
material to exemplify. The idea is that we will learn together from each presentation.
FINAL RESEARCH PAPER (30%)
The final research paper asks you to engage a cultural text that falls into the category of
Latinx popular culture and do a critical analysis, using some of the concepts that were
discussed in class and/or discussed in the readings. The student is expected to also
bring in other sources (limit the number of non-academic sources, make sure that some
are also academic sources). The final research paper should be at least 7 pages in
length, but no more than 10 pages.
Grading Scale:
92-100          A
80-91           B
70-79           C
60-69           D
below 60        E

will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after
the absence.
